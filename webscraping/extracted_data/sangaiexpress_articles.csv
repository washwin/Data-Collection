IMPHAL-Oct-4-The-ATSUM-has-questioned-the-alleged-unethical-and-illogical-recruitment-of-guest-faculties-at-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 4: The ATSUM has questioned the alleged unethical and illogical recruitment of guest faculties at Manipur University.A spectre of private fiefdom is haunting the recruitment and selection process of guest faculties in various departments of Manipur University besides gross violation of the selection norms of the University Grants Commission, said a press release issued by ATSUM general secretary Seiboi Haokip.Constitution of board of members for the selection committee in respect of Department of Political Science was done in utter disregard of the established rules and practices, it alleged.As per the convention, the ‘expert’ should be a faculty not below the rank of a full-fledged Professor but the so-called ‘expert’ Dhruba Pratim Sharma, a faculty in the Department of Political Science, Guwahati University is an Associate Professor, whereas rules of universities provide that only Professor should be nominated as external subject expert.The selection committee which was constituted to conduct interview for guest faculty in Political Science on August 25 was against the UGC guidelines and ethics, it decried.ATSUM alleged that the selection committee was constituted whimsically and interview was held just to select those candidates who are personally close to the Head of the Department. At least a candidate from the Schedule Tribe community should have been selected as social science is the traditional forte of ST candidates. This act could have balanced the dismal representation of less than 3 percent of ST out of 7.5 percent reserved seats in faculty positions, it lamented.Questioning the sanctity of the institution, it wondered as to why not a single post is given to ST candidates despite some candidates getting enviably high academic score.The matter was placed before the Administrator of the university on September 7 to nullify the recruitment but no action has been taken so far, ATSUM decried.It also demanded resignation of the Head of Department of Political Science on moral grounds for allegedly manipulating the selection process.ATSUM strongly condemns the culture of Manipur University where few authorities and teaching faculties see the university as their fiefdom in order to achieve their ill objectives, it said. The authority concerned should rectify the matter at the earliest failing which ATSUM would be compelled to resort to various forms of agitation, it added."
Soubam-Nongpoknganba-Meitei-LLM-President-Indigenous-Development-Mission-Contd-from-last-SaturdayThis-A,"Soubam Nongpoknganba Meitei, LLM (President, Indigenous Development Mission)Contd from last SaturdayThis Act further prohibits the transfer of land from tribal to non tribal but not from non tribal to tribal by making the transfer of land from tribal to non-tribal only possible with the permission from the Deputy Commissioner and the District council wherever District Council exists which in fact makes the transfer of land possible only one way that is to say from Meitei to the Naga or Kuki. The only criteria that permits this legal discrimination is that Meitei is “non-tribal” and not included in the ST list. This is despite the claim that Meitei is a tribal and deserves to be included in the ST list. The end result of this discrimination is that the Meiteis are forced to squeeze themselves in the valley area which is only 9% of the total land area of Manipur and giving a free hand to the so called tribals to eat more into the valley. The ongoing clash between the Meitei and the Kuki has made it abundantly clear how badly the Meitei has been compressed. In fact a rough assessment shows the size of land occupation of the Meitei in the whole of Manipur as 4% of the total land area of Manipur and still the Meiteis are given the title of dominant community so that the discrimination of Meitei can be continued unhindered.Even if the size of population is factored in, as per 2011 census, Meitei constitutes only 44% of the total population that is same with the size of the population of the Scheduled Tribes and yet the concept of “dominance by Meitei” has been strongly institutionalized that both the Meitei and the Non-Meitei accept this concept. The Meitei believes themselves to be the “dominant or major community” christening themselves as the “Big brother” and this concept albeit a wrong concept is so strongly impregnated into the minds of the Meitei that so many Meitei “intellectuals” speak against the inclusion of Meitei in the list of ST and the discrimination is allowed to be carried further.This institutionalization of wrong societal construct backed by the existing legal regime has given rise to a social concept among the tribals that the “hill areas” are their ancestral land to be untouched by any “non-tribal” including the Meitei who are indigenous people of the land and the tribals are welcomed to snatch the Meitei’s land.However the irony is that the definition of Hill in these laws are very much arbitrary. It does not have any basis whatsoever. It is the choice of the “governor” to allocate any land into “hill areas” whereas the concept should be rather geographical. Via such arbitrary allocation of land between “hill and non-hill areas” many area which are not hills have been included in the hill areas. As for example of the total geographical area of 4,570 sq. km. of the district, about 5.57%, i.e. 255 sq. km. is the valley portion. Further there is Khuga valley. In addition it, small valley areas are seen around Behiang, Leizangphai and Tuilaphai.Yet these valleys are defined as “hill areas”. Moreover we have Dzuko valley, Khoupum valley et al. As such the present legal regime has strengthened the division between the Meitei and the non-Meitei, whereas the purpose of law is to remove differences and divisions in the people. The legal brutality against Meitei, these apart, is most significant in the curtailment of the right to contest in Lok Sabha election of the Meitei in eight Assembly Constituencies of Heirok, Wangjing Tentha, Khanga-bok, Wabagai, Kakching, Hiyanglam, Sugnu and Jiribam which are inhabited by Meitei. Yet further, the Constitution (Scheduled Tribe) Order, 1950 recognizes a list of tribes and further recognises “any Kuki” or “any Naga” tribe as ST whereas many Kuki tribes are not indigenous to the State of Manipur but have come from Myanmar or from other States of India, whereas the concept of ST is State specific. And the effect of this inclusion of “any Kuki” or “any Naga” tribe is that the moment they reach Manipur from Myanmar or for that matter from other States, they are given ST status in the State and they get all the privileges of being ST while the Meitei is sidelined from all benefits.

The Assembly has 90 seats and the majority mark is set at 46.In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP and Congress finished almost neck-and-neck; the saffron party won 109 seats and the Congress 114. The State has 230 Assembly segments and the majority mark is 116.Vote-share was split even more equally-41 per cent each for the BJP and the Congress.Of the Rajasthan Assembly's 200 seats (majority mark = 101), the Congress won 100 and the BJP 73 in the last election. The Congress finally formed the Government, and Ashok Gehlot was installed as Chief Minister, after support from the Bahujan Samaj Party, which claimed six seats.Telangana, the only southern State in this round of polls, has 119 seats. The majority mark is set at 60. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's Bharat Rashtra Samithi won a thumping majority in 2018 - it won 88 seats. The Congress was a distant second with 19 and Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM was third with seven. The BJP won just one Assembly segment; T Raja Singh won the Goshamahal seat.Finally, in Mizoram, the Mizo National Front swept the 2018 polls, winning 27 of the State's 40 seats. The Congress won just four and the BJP one. The remaining were won by Independent candidates. The majority mark in the Mizoram Assembly is 21 seats. The term of the Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana Assemblies end in January next year, while that of Mizoram ends in December.  NDTV"

TOKYO-Jan-28Japan-s-space-agency-said-Thursday-that-its-first-lunar-mission-hit-the-tiny-patch-of-the-moon-,"TOKYO, Jan 28Japan's space agency said Thursday that its first lunar mission hit the tiny patch of the moon's surface it was aiming for, in a successful demonstration of its pinpoint landing system—although the probe appears to be lying upside-down.Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the probe's solar batteries made it hard at first to figure out whether the probe landed in the target zone.While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). Improved accuracy would give scientists access to more of the moon, since probes could be placed nearer to obstacles.One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned.A pair of autonomous probes released by SLIM before touchtown sent back images of the box-shaped vehicle on the surface, although it appeared to be upside down.After a few days of data analysis, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA determined that the spacecraft landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, in between two craters near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rock.But after the landing mishap, the craft's solar panels wound up facing the wrong direction, and it cannot generate power. Officials said there is still hope the probe will be able to recharge when the moon enters its daytime in the coming days.JAXA project manager Shinichiro Sakai said the images sent back were just like those he'd imagined and seen in computer renderings.""Something we designed traveled all the way to the moon and took that snapshot. I almost fell down when I saw it,"" he said. For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a ""perfect score.""""We demonstrated that we can land where we want,"" Sakai said. ""We opened a door to a new era.""LEV-1, a hopping robot equipped with an antenna and a camera, was tasked with recording SLIM's landing and transmitting images back to Earth. LEV-2 is a baseball-sized rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy Co. and Doshisha University.The two autonomous probes frame and select images independently, both using LEV-1's antenna to send them back to the base.Daichi Hirano, a JAXA scientist who designed LEV-2, also known as Sora-Q, said it selected images containing SLIM and nearby lunar surface and transmitted the images through LEV-1, making the pair the world's first to achieve the mission. Despite the rush, the probes captured and transmitted 275 images.Japan followed the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India to reach the moon's surface.The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA.JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.SLIM, nicknamed ""the Moon Sniper,"" was intended to seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera.SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25.Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March. AP"
