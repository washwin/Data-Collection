international-mother-language-day,"International Mother Language DayBy: Sanjenbam Jugeshwor SinghInternational Mother Language Day is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and to promote multilingualism. This day is also recognized as Matribhasha Diwas. The theme for International Mother Language Day 2024 is “To set goals for preserving endangered languages, promoting multilingualism, and sustaining linguistic heritage”. First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262 in 2002. Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative “to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world” as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, which also established 2008 as the International Year of Languages. The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, 21 February (1952) is the anniversary of the day when the Bengalis i.e. Pakistani Bengali Muslims (now Bangladeshi Bengali Muslims) of the Pakistani province of East Bengal (now independent state of Bangladesh) fought for recognition of their Bengali language. It is also observed by the Indian Bengalis of the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Tripura and Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.21 February was declared to be International Mother Language Day by UNESCO on 17th November, 1999. It has been observed throughout the world since 21 February 2000. The declaration came up in tribute to the Language Movement done by the Bangladeshis (then the East Pakistan).When Pakistan was created in 1947; it had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). The two parts were very different from each other in the sense of culture and language, and were also separated by India in between. In 1948, the Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan, even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan and West Pakistan. The East Pakistan people protested since the majority of the population was from East Pakistan and their mother language was Bangla. They demanded Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu. The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan.To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings. On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed. Abdul Jabbar and Shafiur Rahman died, with hundreds of others injured. This was a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue. Since then, Bangladeshis celebrate the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days. They visit the Shaheed Minar, a monument built in memory of the martyrs and its replicas to express their deep sorrow, respect and gratitude to them.International Mother Language Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh. The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, Bengalis living in Vancouver, Canada. They wrote a letter to Kofi Annan on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world’s languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement. Languages are the most powerful instruments of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage. All moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue.Rafiqul Islam’s proposal was introduced in the Bangladesh Parliament and in due course (at the behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) a formal proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Government of Bangladesh. The process of shepherding the proposal through UNESCO’s regulatory system was undertaken by Syed Muazzem Ali, then Bangladesh ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to UNESCO, and Tozammel Tony Huq, his predecessor, who was then a Special Adviser to UNESCO Secretary General Federico Mayor. Finally on 17 November 1999, the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously resolved that “21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952.”As knowledge grows, people are coming to understand that languages are critical for growth, ensuring cultural variety, and facilitating international conversation, but they are also important for cooperation and educational quality for everyone. Today there is growing awareness that languages play a vital role in development, in ensuring cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, but also in strengthening co-operation and attaining quality education for all, in building inclusive knowledge societies and preserving cultural heritage, and in mobilizing political will for applying the benefits of science and technology to sustainable development. Languages, with their complex implications for identity, communication, social integration, education and development, are of strategic importance for people and planet. Yet, due to globalization processes, they are increasingly under threat, or disappearing altogether. When languages fade, so does the world’s rich tapestry of cultural diversity. Opportunities, traditions, memory, unique modes of thinking and expression — valuable resources for ensuring a better future — are also lost. Every two weeks a language disappears taking with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage. At least 43% of the estimated 6000 languages spoken in the world are endangered. Only a few hundred languages have genuinely been given a place in education systems and the public domain, and less than a hundred are used in the digital world. Multilingual and multicultural societies exist through their languages, which transmit and preserve traditional knowledge and cultures in a sustainable way. International Mother Language Day is observed every year to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism. It’s a known fact that several countries across the world are multilingual (or at the very least, bilingual), and their languages form their cultural and intellectual heritage. International Mother Language Day is celebrated to promote multilingual education and free expression in the mother tongue. The day encourages everyone to nurture linguistic diversity, and develop awareness of different linguistic traditions across the globe.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
migratory-birds-loktak-lake,"Migratory birds including those from Siberia have started flocking the Loktak Lake and its surrounding smaller lakes and marshy lands. Several migratory birds and a variety of waterfowl have arrived at Loktak Lake. The lake is also the breeding ground of a number of migratory birds. More than 30 rare migratory birds such as brahmani duck/ruddy duck, pochard, red-legged falcon, geese, snipe, shiri, etc. from Siberia, mainland Russia and the Himalayan range visit Loktak, the only fresh water lake in the Northeastern region particularly in the winter months of November, December and January. But, environmentalists are concerned with the sharp reduction in the number of these birds in the last few years. They say that about only 20 types of aquatic birds visited the lake in the last few years. Over-hunting, gradual decrease of the habitat and the climatic changes are the reasons behind the sharp reduction. Birds like ukong, gull, Kanga, red-legged falcon, which were seen in flocks 10 years ago, are no more seen visiting the lake. Gulls numbering around 30 were last seen flocking at the Pumlen Pat a few years back. Butthis bird no longer visits the Pat, environmentalists have observed. Red-legged falcons coming from the lakes in Siberia which flocked at Loktak have now shifted their flocking places at the banks of Barak, Makru and Irang rivers. This bird will remain till December and then shift to the lakes in south India, Sri Lanka, etc. Deforestation, urbanization and use of insecticides, to meet the demands of an expanding population coupled by climate changes has threatened Manipur’s rich biodiversity and rendered certain fish and bird species extinct. Ornithologists conducting a head count of migratory water birds at Manipur’s Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in South Asia, have expressed disappointment over spotting fewer winged guests this time.The census, organised by the Bombay Natural History Society and supported by Manipur’s Environment and Climate Change Department and Loktak Development Authority, covered Loktak and the Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) last week.KLNP, the largest floating park in the world and home to the rare and endangered brow-antlered deer, locally known as Sangai, served as the focal point of the head count. According to state coordinator of Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), the census exercises were conducted at 50 spots across Loktak and Keibul Lamjao and each spot was manned by four ornithologists using telephoto cameras and binocular. Students and researchers also supported the head count. Although the final census report is pending, however the team anticipates the total bird count to be less than 12,000, with a significant drop in species by around 10.This decline is disheartening compared to previous figures, when over 20,000 birds of more than 20 species were spotted, and in some years, even over 30,000 birds were witnessed.However,it is noted that all the resident waterfowl species, such as lesser whistling ducks, coot, pheasant tail jacana, were still observed. The census included certain migratory bird species like coot, ferruginous pochard, gadwall, but Baer’s pochards from Mongolia, seen in previous years at Keibul Lamjao, were notably absent.The team attributed the dwindling figures of migratory water birds at Loktak to factors such as construction of private fish farms along the lake shores disturbing shoreline birds, an increase in the number of fishermen, poaching, and the use of LED bulbs by fishermen at night. Amid Manipur’s battle against protracted ethnic violence, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) and the fishing community that is facing the impact of indiscriminate hunting of waterfowl and the illegal use of the electric shock method for fishing have been urging the public to emerge as responsible guardians of this invaluable natural resource.The lake is not just a source of livelihood, but a goddess to the people of Manipur and a mother to the fishing community. It is the cradle of Manipuri civilisation and culture.Altogether 32,853 wild birds including different species were sighted during this year‘s bird count.Even though this year‘s figure was lower than last and previous years, never-seen species of birds were sighted this year, but more than 34,000 birds were sighted last year. Out of around 60 species of wild birds sighted during the count, Whistling Teal locally known as Tingri was seen the most and altogether 14,000 Tingris were sighted. One area where the maximum number of wild birds flocked together was the northern side of the lake‘s Ningthoukhong sector, the report said pointing out that the number of birds seen this year was lower than previous year because of trapping and hunting of wild birds by some locals. Moreover, common Shelduck (local name Thangong Arangba), Glossy (Ibis Kakshu), Grey Leg Geese (Kanga) and Mandarin Duck (Sana Nganu) were also seen after a gap of many years. Of the thousands of migratory birds that have landed this winter at Loktak Lake, in Manipur in northeast India, the rare sighting of a once-abundant songbird with distinctive bright yellow under parts holds a different meaning for birders.With a push from conservationists and strong participation of local community, especially youth, the state government aimsto ramp up the number of dwindling birds around the shrinking Loktak Lake by setting up this sanctuary in a one square kilometer wetland patch in Thinungei village to the west of Loktak Lake. Nestled in the northeastern state of Manipur, India, Loktak Lake is the largest floating freshwater lake in South Asia. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the Phumdis, or floating islands that dot the lake’s surface. The Phumdis are caused by the lake’s unique geographical and geological features. During the rainy season, the lake covers about 286 square kilometers but reduces to about 40 square kilometers during the dry season. The phumdis, made up of flora, biological materials, and soil, float on the lake’s surface, making it a mosaic of green islands. The floating mass continually shifts and responds to changing seasons and weather conditions. Loktak Lake’s dynamic nature distinguishes it from other lakes and makes it an ecological wonder.Loktak Lake is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The Phumdis are home to various plant species, including grasses, shrubs, and aquatic plants. The endangered sangai deer, commonly known as the dancing deer due to its elegant movements, is found in the Keibul Lamjao National Park, which spans a large chunk of the lake. The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is found nowhere else on the planet. Fishing is an important activity in the Loktak Lake region, supporting many local populations. The lake is filled with fish species, such as Indian major carp, essential to the local economy. Besides its ecological richness, Loktak Lake has enormous cultural value for Manipur’s indigenous inhabitants. It is not just a source of income for them but also a part of their cultural legacy. The lake has been a significant resource for fishing, agriculture, and transportation for generations. The Phumdis are used for farming, and traditional cottages called “Phumshangs” are constructed on them. One of Loktak Lake’s most unique and physically stunning features is the traditional fishing technique called “Phumdi phishing.” Fishermen use cone-shaped nets to catch fish from their small, circular boats. This technique is not only a monument to the local communities’ inventiveness but also an important component of their cultural identity.While Loktak Lake is undeniably a natural wonder that blends stunning beauty with ecological value and cultural significance,it suffers several environmental challenges. Pollution is a significant issue, primarily from agricultural runoff and home sewage. Introducing invasive aquatic organisms like water hyacinth endangers the lake’s fragile ecosystem. To address these issues, conservation activities have been launched. The Keibul Lamjao National Park, which encompasses a large chunk of the lake, has been declared a Ramsar Site and is internationally recognized for its importance as a wetland. Several organizations and government agencies collaborate to safeguard and preserve the lake’s distinct environment. It emphasizes the importance of protecting these delicate ecosystems for future generations by demonstrating the interconnectedness of nature and human life. A visit to Loktak’s Floating Lake is not only an opportunity to observe nature’s wonder but also an opportunity to connect with a way of life that is truly unique and inspiring.Writer can be reached at:[email protected] "
wetland-and-human-wellbeing,"Wetlands provide habitat to a variety of native species of plant and animals as well as thousands of winter migratory birds. They prevent settlements from getting flooded by absorbing excess rainwater and then releasing it slowly during dry seasons or during droughts. They also help sequestrate carbon, which helps mitigate climate change. Wetlands are an important source of water security, act as buffers in extreme events, provide livelihood to people depending on their produce, act as cultural and recreational hubs and help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wetlands provide excellent opportunities for education and research and are good habitats for migratory birds and hot spots of biodiversity. Wetlands are valuable as sources, sinks and transformers of a multitude of biological, chemical and genetic material. In addition, wetlands have special attributes as the cultural heritage of humanity and have deep connections with our beliefs and practices. Wetlands provide several benefits to humanity and, therefore, need to be conserved and used wisely. In spite of all the benefits provided by wetlands, these ecosystems continue to be degraded, polluted, encroached upon and converted for alternate uses. A wetland area trend index constructed by Wetlands International South Asia for Indian wetlands based on 237 published data points for 1980 – 2014 indicates an average decline in natural wetlands area by 30%. The rapid loss of natural wetlands is as much a threat to water and climate security as is an environmental crisis.  The current efforts for wetlands conservation are far short by several orders of the rapid pace of degradation of these ecosystems.The wetlands outside the protected areas are never fenced or demarcated properly leading to encroachments. As per the 2017 rules, district-level wetland authorities for all the 75 districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh are to be made with district magistrate as chairperson. However, mapping and demarcation of all wetlands has not been done yet. Many districts have not even convened the meeting of the district wetland authority. Correctly mapping all the wetlands in the state is a critical step in the wetland restoration process. Till October 2023, as many as 75 wetlands in the country have been categorised as Ramsar sites, out of which 10 are in Uttar Pradesh. The 10 Ramsar sites in Uttar Pradesh provide protection to almost 40,000 ha of water bodies. The 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance is the oldest convention related to protection of water bodies. The convention came into force on December, 21, 1975 and India became signatory to it on February 1, 1982.Wetlands outside the protected areas are being frequently transformed into built-up areas for various development projects, including housing, businesses and road construction. Such activities cause heavy destruction to their existence and the ecosystems they support. There are thousands of wetlands in the districts of Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Lucknow, Barabanki, Sitapur and Baharaich. Hardoi alone has more than 2,000 wetlands. Rae Bareli has lost around 89 per cent of wetlands since 1972. Lucknow lost around 70 per cent of wetlands in the last 50 years. Baghel Taal in Bahraich district, whose perimeter is almost 42 km, is not even declared as wetland, despite being one of the largest wetlands in the state. Its jurisdiction is a subject of confusion between the forest division of Bahraich and Katarniaghat, a nearby protected wildlife sanctuary that encompasses several swamps and wetlands. Many wetlands are divided between revenue departments of two districts, creating conflicts and confusion in their protection. For example, Haiderpur Wetland, which falls under Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, is on the border of Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar districts. But the land does not come under the jurisdiction of the forest department of Ignore. In fact, as reported by the Space application Center, Manipur also has 139 wetlands even though that depends on sizes that more than 2.25 hectares. So out of those we could find and verified only 23 wetlands. But as of now, we cannot say that other wetlands are lost. Now as reported by the State wetland Authority, which is the Nodal Agency, led by the Director of Environment and Climate Change, it has identified 23 wetlands and documented for sustainable management. It is also reported in a Local TV channel that Awang Lamphel Pat at Tangkham Maning, Sawombung Block, Imphal East, which was once a wetland has lost its original & natural status.In the absence of any protection, over-extraction of groundwater for intensive irrigation is causing the demise of many of these wetlands. They are routinely tilled; tractors can be seen ploughing wetlands even in the protected areas.  Due to various anthropogenic threats, including high loads of pollutants from agricultural runoff, industrial waste and sewage, native species of wetlands are being replaced by invasive species. Invasive species have the capacity to outcompete native plants and animals within wetlands. This can lead to a disturbance in the ecosystem, ultimately diminishing the overall health of the wetland. It is important to delineate the boundary of the wetlands correctly; generally pre-monsoon water spread of the wetlands is almost half of the post-monsoon water spread. Therefore, the best time to mark the boundary is post-monsoon which shows the actual spread of the wetlands. The boundary should include all structural components such as marshy area, mudflats and aquatic vegetation. Of the four types of aquatic vegetation found on wetland—floating, emergent, submerged and benthic—only floating and emergent vegetation can be captured by the drone camera or satellite pictures.Celebrated annually on 2 February, World Wetland Day aims to raise global awareness about the vital role of wetlands for people and the planet to mark the day of the adoption of the Ramsar Convention in 1971. The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty for the conservation of wetlands. World Wetland Day has been organised since 1995 to raise awareness of the value of wetlands for nature and society. The theme for World Wetlands Day 2024 is ‘Wetlands and human wellbeing.’ This theme spotlights the interconnectedness wetlands have with human life, with people drawing sustenance, inspiration and resilience from these productive ecosystems. Importantly, this theme underscores how all aspects of human well-being are tied to the health of the world’s wetlands and calls on each of us to value and steward our wetlands. On 30th August 2021, in the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution was adopted proclaiming 2nd February of each year as World Wetland Day. The commemoration raises awareness and increases people’s understanding of the critical importance of wetlands. In every corner of the world, human beings have depended on wetlands for centuries, drawing sustenance, inspiration and resilience from these important environments. This year’s theme: ‘Wetlands and Human Wellbeing’ highlights the linkages between people, culture and nature./  We need healthy wetlands for our planet, and for our wellbeing. Wetlands are currently protected under different designations, including the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. Currently almost 100 UNESCO World Heritage wetlands are overlapping wholly or partially with over 140 Ramsar Sites. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the World Heritage Convention safeguard wetland sites covering an area larger than Mexico (245 614 112 ha).Despite this protection by these global international treaties – wetlands are still an often overlooked asset of our natural environment. The continuous monitoring and preservation of World Heritage wetlands is a monumental task, and it is impossible for UNESCO and the States Parties to do it alone. We are very grateful to combine our efforts with the devotion and expertise of Ramsar and the many other people and organizations we work with, worldwide. The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2010, enacted under the Environment Protection Act of 1986, make it compulsory for the state government to identify, demarcate and officially designate all wetlands across the state within a stipulated period of two years. Further, the state has created a State Wetland Authority after the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2017 shifted the emphasis of wetland management from a central authority to state-level bodies. The State Wetland Authority is responsible for the conservation and management of wetlands in the state. Apart from these, various laws and regulations have been formulated to protect wetlands and their biodiversity, such as the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Yet, wetlands in Uttar Pradesh continue to face multiple threats, primarily from encroachments.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
restoration-of-lamphel-pat-in-its-original-status,"Lamphelpat, which is in the foothills of the Langol hill range, was a natural water reservoir. Siltations, encroachment by private individuals and construction of government installations have turned it into a mere marshy place. The historically significant Lamphelpat is staring at an uncertain future. This wetland in the urban area of Imphal West district is about 19.22 square kilometers and “shrinking”, said experts. Lamphelpat is a mini Loktak lake, maintaining the ecosystem of Imphal city and its surrounding areas. In the past it served as a reservoir, storing excess water of the Luwangli and Nambul rivers during monsoon. It was used to release water to the rivers during the lean season. It is said that Maharaj Bodhchandra Singh’s durbar resolved in the early ’40s to prevent conversion of the water body into an agricultural land.Lamphel in Imphal West is about 60 square kilometers in area and comprises 25.01 sq. km in rural area and 34.99 sq. km in urban area. And for many years, the famous Lamphelpat had been providing its abundant resources and services to the surrounding people. The wetland stores water drained from the Lamphel Reserve Forest and the Nambul River. It brought down the temperature and controlled or mitigated flood by storing the excess water from Nambul River. Residents of Uripok, neighbors to the Lamphelpat, hailed the decision taken by state government. Uripok is a flood-prone neighbourhood.”We suffer floods every year. This time we had five floods due to breaches of the Nambul embankment. Two days’ rain makes the river overflow and rainwater has nowhere to go. Uripok is flooded if rain continues for two days,” a person, who is residing near the Nambul river, said. Other areas of Imphal too experienced flash floods whenever it rains. Now all these have been affected by uncontrolled anthropogenic activities and negligence. However it is confident that once Lamphelpat’s water body is restored, floods can be controlled and water scarcity in an around Imphal city will end.With siltation, human encroachment and dumping of waste materials in the wetland, the Lamphelpat has lost its original glory. Siltation and dumping of waste materials have made it shallower every year and water plants and weeds have wholly covered the wetland suffocating it. “Wetlands offer many benefits or services.  They regulate micro- climate and bring down temperature of the local area. They help mitigate floods and support biodiversity. They are home to many flora and fauna essential to maintaining ecological balance. “On conservation that bringing water back to the wetland only would not help preserve and save it. “A wetland can be said to have been restored and preserved when it resumes all the ecosystem services. It would again support all the flora and fauna and regulate micro-climate.”The densely populated urban area of Imphal or the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is warmer than the rural areas surrounding it. This excess heat is created by energy from all the people, cars, buses and infrastructures. However, the presence of a healthy urban wetland would provide a micro-climate, a local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas. It (wetland) would cool or bring down the temperature in the urban area by absorbing carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Further, if the Lamphelpat is restored and successfully conserved, it would reduce or mitigate flash floods that happen frequently in Imphal area. Human settlement and development can take place vertically without affecting the wetland, that timely and speedy conservation of the wetland would benefit all. Resources mapping may be done to protect and conserve them.According to State Wetland Technical Committee, the Lamphelpat is one among many wetlands the committee recommended to the State Wetland Authority for conservation. The Lamphelpat was also famous for Kombirei flower. Conserving the wetland would not only bring back this flower but also migratory birds. Conserving the wetland would also attract tourists. According to experts the soil profile of the Lamphelpat has revealed that it contains about 20 feet thick layer of soil made of decomposed biomass and soft clay. This soil profile confirms that it was a wetland that the upper soil of the Lamphelpat burns when dried and ignited because it is composed of decomposed biomass. Further, the soil of Lamphelpat is not suitable for major construction and as such there had been discussion to build some of the infrastructure elsewhere. It is also known fact that, there have been frequent floods in the wetland area as the Samusang Uku (culvert-drainage/discharge point) was narrow. During the 2015 flood, about 1131 mm water was drained into the Lamphelpat when discharge capacity at Samusang Uku was about 31.2 cubic meters per second. During the rainy season of 2018, about 1974 mm water was drained into the wetland when the Samusang Uku was able to discharge only about 18.3 cubic meters per second. This made the water level of Lamphelpat rise enormously flooding the surrounding areas.On the other hand, some historian recalled that the Lamphelpat was a source of livelihood for the locals. Locals used to fish in the water and cattle grazed in the wetland. There were no major settlements and infrastructure development in the wetland area till the 1960s. Since the 60s, there have been massive changes in terms of settlement and infrastructure development in the wetland.Now there is Central Agricultural University, Zoo, Games Village, Langol Housing Complex, NIT, Sewage Plan and other Government offices and projects in the wetland area. There are three major roads-Games village road, Shija Hospital road and Central School road, all of which are affecting and disturbing the natural flow of water causing floods. The Lamphelpat used to mitigate floods, now it is causing floods. The wetland should be conserved in time before it is too late, he added.Meanwhile, according to Water Resources Department, development of a 442 square kilometres water body in Lamphelpat area has been started and going on in full-swing. The project with an estimated cost of around Rs. 650 croreis being implemented under the Ministry of Jal Shakti with funding from the World Bank. 80 percent of the cost will be borne by the Centre while the remaining 20 percent will be covered by the State Government.The project aims at improving and enhancing supply of drinking water, flood control and eco-tourism. The planned water body would store excess water from Nambul River and water collected from various sources and catchment areas would be further treated for use in water supply schemes. In fact restoration of Lamphelpat will benefit enormously for the people of Manipur in general and Imphal area in particular. This is a right step forward and let’s hopes it is completed in the stipulated time.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
intellectual-property-challenges-issues,"Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected by law, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.Important IPR are:A Patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how – or whether – the invention can be used by others. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document. Copyright is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps and technical drawings. A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks date back to ancient times when artisans used to put their signature or “mark” on their products. Geographical indications and appellations of origin are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, a reputation or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. An industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an article, or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color. Trade secrets are IP rights on confidential information which may be sold or licensed. The unauthorized acquisition, use or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection.Intellectual property challenges are the threats to the stability of copyright, trademark, patent, and other areas of intellectual property (IP) protection. The balance between the interests and needs of creators and the public is a fundamental underpinning of IP law. When this balance is no longer maintained, respect for Intellectual property protection is in danger. Thirty years ago, IP was a small specialty area of law; today, it is an ever-growing field that supports billion-dollar industries. Despite this increased importance and prevalence, the sanctity of IP protection is threatened by a lack of respect for this area of law. Many individuals believe that: IP infringement doesn’t hurt anyone; if they do infringe on another’s IP, they won’t get caught; IP rights allow the owner to collect inflated profits; IP rights restrict competition. These perceptions indicate that many believe that the balance of IP laws is in favor of the holders of these rights, as illustrated by the ready availability of counterfeit products; pirated movies, music, and software.India joined WTO (World Trade Organization) and became a signatory of the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual rights) agreements in the year of 1995. With this, all the signatories were supposed to align their IP rules in conformation with the TRIPS agreement. However, developing countries like India were granted a window period of 10 years (5-compulsory +5 extended) to comply with the rules put forth by the agreement. Though India had aligned its rule in accordance to TRIPS in the year 2005, still, there are many challenges and issues that need to be addressed to maximize the benefits. Thus getting and granting IP rights in India have become a matter of contention since 2005 and various stakeholders are interested in knowing India address these issues.Though, there are many challenges we will list only the top 6, that are of utmost importance in India, they are:1. From Process to Product Patents- One of the binding point in TRIPS agreement is that all member countries are required to shift their patent regime from “Process Patent” to “Product Patent.” The fundamental difference between a Process Patent regime and a Product Patent regime lies in the fact that the former protects for processes only while the latter products. It becomes a contentious issue when it comes to getting IP rights on pharmaceuticals and food products.2. Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act- Another challenge that it is facing is the condemnation of section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act. This section prevents multinational companies ever greening their patents simply by making minor changes. Implementation of 3(d) was exercised in challenging the patent of Novartis Glevac drug. The Court rules that multinational companies can’t evergreen their patents simply by making minor changes in earlier patents and they need to show considerable “Therapeutic Efficiency” to get patent protection in already existing patents.3#Compulsory licensing- With the provision of compulsory licensing, the Govt. of India can compel the owner company or other companies to mass produce some drugs in emergency irrespective of who got the patent. Multinationals are accusing India of being opportunistic in their stand and are asking to abrogate this provision. However, Indian Govt. is not willing to cancel this provision to safeguard the interests of mass4. Provision of Drug Price Control Order- With this provision companies can’t charge an unfair price for drugs that they are producing. The price has to be justified regarding investments, and if someone plays foul, then the Govt. has the right to intervene.5. Food security and IPR- India is a land of farmers wherein most of the people are engaged in doing farming for their livelihood. In such a country Govt. offers many subsidies to farmers. India’s domestic support schemes are generally in the form of “minimum support price” for major agricultural commodities and “input” subsidies provided to farmers in the types of electricity, fertilizers, seeds, etc. However, for complete implementation of TRIPS agreements, these subsidies will have to be reduced or eliminated. Thus, the Indian Government is struggling to create a balance between food security and providing IP rights in India.6. IPRs, Community property rights, & Indigenous knowledge- Traditional knowledge gives ready-made leads for pharmaceutical companies and then simply come up with the new formulation to show the efficacy of the general traditional understanding. The Indian Govt. is bound to protect the rich source of traditional knowledge by not allowing multinationals to get patents on traditional culture. As a defensive mechanism, the Govt. has created TKDL (Traditional Knowledge Digital Library) to challenge patenting traditional Indian understanding. Multinationals and developed countries are also opposing this move.Intellectual Property Rights (India): Neglected IssuesIn Manipur context, main issues of IPR are: Lack of awareness about IPR among people; there are no state specific IPR policies; there are issues related to bio piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge; Poor protection for indigenous designs, arts and crafts. In fact unique Manipuri crafts lack IP protection and absence of GI tag as results motifs of copying Manipuri designs by outsiders is a well-known fact. The case of King Chili (Uoo Morok) is an example as it was claimed as the assets of Nagaland and case of Modi Ghamsha in UP, copying of Rani Fee as well as Wangkhei fee designs by outsiders etc. Therefore we need awareness drives about IPR importance; formulate IPR policies and incentives; set up IP felicitation center for promoting innovation; protect traditional knowledge digitally and support GI and branding indigenous goods.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
eves-power-to-prevail-at-r-day-parade-in-national-capital,"With 75 th Republic Day being held with the themes of “Viksit Bharat” and “Bharat – Loktantra ki Matruka” and the women marching contingents and flying squadrons being led by women officers, the celebration will have the best representation of women at R Day celebration in New Delhi.For the first time, the parade will be heralded by 100 women artists playing Indian musical instruments, who will play the music of “Sankh”, “Naadswaram”, “Nagada”, etc. It will witness an all-women Tri-Service contingent marching down Kartavya Path for the first time. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) contingents will comprise women personnel from the BSF, CRPF, and SSB. A total of 48 Agnivayu women will be part of the IAF contingent. The contingents of Armed Forces Medical Services and Delhi Police will also be part of the parade. The combined daredevil bikers team on Royal Enfield Bullets, a first in parade history, will precede Indian Air Force assets.Displaying the women’s prowess, the IAF’s Tableau based on the theme “ Bharatiya Vayusena, Saksham, Sashakt and Atmnirbhar” (IAF Potent, Powerful and Self-reliant) will be led by Flit Lt Ananya Sharma and Flying Officer Asma Shaikh. Similarly, the IAF’s marching contingent will be led by Squadron Leader Rashmi Thakur with Squadron Leaders- Sumita Yadav and Pratiti Ahluwalia and Flt Lt Kirti Rohil.While the Army and Navy contingents/floats will also show their might, the IAF is entering the fray with 51 aircraft, including 8 transport aircraft (with C-295 transport aircraft making debut), 13 helicopters, and one heritage aircraft. They would participate in the dazzling flypast and would include 15 women pilots. One Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft and two Rafale aircraft of the French Air Force will also participate in the Fly-past. A 95-member marching contingent and a 33-member band will be part of the contingent.Additionally, the floats from 16 States/UTs and 09 Ministries/Organisations tableaux will display the country’s rich cultural diversity, unity, and progress.Chief GuestThe French President Emmanuel Macron will be the Chief Guest. This is for the 6th time, a representative of France will be India’s guest. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac (1976) and the Presidents Valery Giscard d’Estaing (1980), Jacques Chirac (1998), Nicolas Sarkozy (2008), and Francois Hollande (2016) were the earlier guests. Besides France, the representatives of the United Kingdom were the guests at the R Day function on five occasions.EconomyWhile India is aspiring to be a $5 trillion economy by next year, the outstanding internal and external debt at Rs.169,46,666.65 crore at the end of 2023-2024 is a cause of concern. It was Rs 152,61,122.12 crore at the end of 2022-2023. The United Nations has projected India’s growth rate (GDP) at 6.2% this year, while the RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has predicted,That the Indian economy is expected to grow 7 per cent in fiscal 2024-25. In the meanwhile the Indian rupee stands at Rs. 83.12 per US Dollar.HealthThe country’s population is 140.76 crore with a 74.37% literacy rate. The infant mortality rate is 25.799 deaths per 1000 live births. The doctor-population ratio is 1:834 and the nurse-population ratio is 1:476. The existing hospital bed-to-population ratio is 1.3/1000 (private plus public hospitals), and there is a deficit of 1.7/1000 population. As such there is an additional requirement of 2.4 million beds. Going by the strength of 13,08,009 allopathic doctors, 5,65000 AYUSH doctors, and 361,400 nursing personnel, the health infrastructure needs drastic improvement.UnemploymentAs per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the unemployment rate scaled down to 3.2 % in 2022-2023 as against 4.1 % in 2021-22 and 4.2 % in 2020-2021. However, according to a Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report, the national unemployment rate stood at 7.95 % as of July 2023. The unemployment rate in urban and rural India was 7.93% and 7.44%. respectively. Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Delhi are having the highest unemployment rates. In 2023 the unemployment rate was the highest at 37.4 %.in Haryana and the lowest at 09 %.in Odisha.Defence/SpaceWith a thrust on self-reliance and a robust budget of Rs 5,93,537.64 crore, the country’s defence export is expected to cross Rs 24,000 crore in the financial year 2024. Similarly with rapid progress in space research, now ISRO plans to launch the Mangalayan II this year. It will study aspects of Mars, including interplanetary dust, and the Martian atmosphere and environment. With these advancements let’s hope that India becomes superpower soon! "
present-manipur-social-imbroglio-where-is-the-provincial-government,"By: Amar YumnamImphal, Jan 22: The absolute social mess in Manipur which is racing fast to complete a year can be looked at from two angles – one from the angle of governance competence of the provincial government and another from the perspective of the sensibility and commitment of the union government. The necessity of looking from the governance approach arises because – in quite unlike the historical experiences of Manipur – instead of a week or fortnight turmoil, it continues with features of rising inhumanity. Above all, it is not Manipur at all as we have understood and experienced historically.In this piece, I shall be looking at the crisis by examining how and what the provincial government has been like. During the last about half a century of training and indulgence in governance studies, I have never seen anyone like the present provincial government in terms of the following qualitative characteristics:1. The cultural and the historical legacy is not only unaware but take as irrelevant;2. Non-application of mind in deciding the priority of issues in deciding for attention;3. Making frequent statements least relevant to the crises being encountered;4. The inability to understand the difference between the routine law and order problem and a social problem;5. The lack of knowledge of what a social problem is in a diverse society;6. The absence of understanding of the differential demographic features;7. The absolute lack of appreciation of the geographic features;8. The contemporary global competition for progress based on social and technological choices is something out of the world; and9. The province is taken as any other province anywhere.All these weaknesses reveal that the present provincial government is not even aware of what governance implies. A few lines would be of relevance here. Instead of own statements, I would rather quote from known authorities such that unnecessary queries are made; this is particularly because in recent years we observe a trend among youths of criticising with uncultured languages in social media and private talks while they fail to appreciate any argument in a debate instead of putting labour to understand: there is a social decline of serious study. Vasudha Chhotray and Gary Stroker (2009) define governance in their book Governance Theory and Practice : A Cross-Disciplinary Approach thus: “First governance is a political activity; it is about coordination and decision-making in the context of a plurality of views and interests.Conflict and dissent provide essential ingredients to a governance process. Given human society, as it has been and as it might reasonably be expected to be in the future, people will make judgements about what is right for themselves and for others, and that there is no reason to assume that those judgements will be shared. Equally it is clear that as humans we need to find ways to act together, to engage in collective action, to resolve the problems and challenges of living together. ….. as ‘the struggles which result from the collisions between human purposes: most clearly when these collisions involve large numbers of human beings’. Politics informs governance in that it provides the raw material both to construct governance arrangements and the focus of much governance activity when it is operating.“The second …… governance is an intensely human activity [whose] existence to some extent is explained by the limits of our human capacities. If we are all-seeing and knowing and could faithfully predict each other’s behaviour then the frameworks and rules of governance would be unnecessary. We could exchange views and resolve conflicts without resort to institutions and practices that simplify our choices, limit our areas of focus, push our understanding in certain directions and provide rules of thumb or heuristics so that we have a rough idea about what to do in different settings. Governance exists in part because it provides us with effective ways to cope with the limitations of human cognition and understanding. It provides architecture for choice in the context of our bounded rationality….Governance arrangements are brought to life by decision-makers that are boundedly rational. Decision-makers, as it were, have to deal both with the external environment and their inner world, their cognitive architecture. The inner world helps them to focus on some things and ignore others and it is driven by habits of thought, rules of thumb, and emotions. Rationality is ‘bounded’ by this framing role of the human mind. Insights from social psychology and cognitive studies suggest that actors develop various coping techniques and heurists to deal with the challenges they face. Some are seen as providing effective ways of coming to a judgement – ‘better than comprehensive rationality’ – and others are seen as having in-built pathologies or weaknesses … One of the characteristics of an effective governance mechanism is that it steers actors and the organisations they lead to certain types of desired behaviour in the context of bounded rationality.”This is where what Maartwn Hajer says in his Authoritative Governance Policy-making in the Age of Mediatization (2009) becomes relevant. “Governance, in my view, is and has always been first and foremost about the authoritative enactment of meaning. Once meaning is given, policies will follow, albeit obviously not autonomously and effortlessly. Ontological and epistemological convictions …. ensure that I pay a good deal of attention to the contingency of political moments and the sequential logic of political events that, from one moment to the next, create and re-create meaning and, ultimately, create political facts. With the emphasis on this discursive work comes the return of the actor, although obviously in settings that exert influence themselves. The presumption then is that situations are constantly negotiated, and that those who are able to impose their interpretations of reality on others gain substantial control over political debates, no matter what their institutional position is. It is (yet another) call to open up the institutions that represent power, and investigate empirically how and why institutions (and the protagonists that are their ‘face’) are authoritative in some situations, and what explains their failure in others. Given this emphasis on the role of political performance, it will not come as a surprise that I suggest we can make sense of policy-making in our age by employing a perspective analysing governance as political drama.”With this nearly longish understanding of governance, we can straightway come to policy-making. This is where the provincial government has utterly failed. No government under the sun can know about Manipur better than the provincial government of Manipur. The necessity of policy, currently emphasised around the globe, is that it should be contextual land relevant. Instead of this what has happened in the ongoing crisis in Manipur are the absolute unwillingness to apply mind and the complete absence of policy being framed by the provincial to the happenings of violence and death that have been the undoing of Manipur. This failure has led to the second-round effect of the actual happenings and potential social costs being reported to the union government. Since there are no reports and pressures from the provincial government, the union government too took the convenient approach of ignoring all happenings. "
education-in-india-is-passing-through-once-again-a-seminal-phase-in-its-growth,"India’s education system faces critical challenges, particularly in postgraduate education, and raises questions about policies’ coherenceEducation in India is passing through, once again, a seminal phase in its growth. Since 1947, it has passed through several phases of change and each phase has had its own tale to tell.Generally, education is seen in three phases: school education, college education and postgraduate education. School education is broadly divided into three areas, classes 1 to 5, generally known as primary school; classes 5-10 middle school, and classes 10-12, secondary school. These are not rigid levels but are loosely used for classification and easy communication.The college-level education is from 1st year to 3rd year, which leads to a bachelor’s degree and 4th year and 5th year, which leads to a postgraduate degree. The doctoral education could thereafter follow. Institutions are known to specialise amongst these various segments and acquire a brand for that. In school education, some do offer class 1 to class 12 education, and there are others who also offer pre-class 1 education which can be termed as a nursery stage.Postgraduate education, especially after a master’s degree has been normally followed by at least 1 year pre-Ph.Dwork and at least 2 years of PhD work if one has to go through it. Periodic changes have taken place and continue to take place. Illustratively, a formal 1 year pre-Ph.D work which could lead to a terminal M.Phil degree has been recently abolished. This kind of decision clearly has implications because it will affect the career prospects of those who had an M.Phil Degree but did not go for a PhD degree. This act of doing away with an M.Phil award was sudden for a lot of people, and it affected many careers including those that were in the middle of the 1 year M.Phil course. One of the bigger problems was rendering, useless, a whole year of work without prior notice. This kind of jerk and jolt can have arbitrary effects.This is an aberration which needs to be understood and perhaps modified. One of the questions that remains is that education is a concurrent subject. This means, technically, about a degree like M.Phil, the UGC may legislate something but equally, technically the state legislature could continue a different mandate. The UGC could then refuse to give it cognizance for grants. This could lead to complications. That is another story.The history of degrees and their awards across the length and breadth of the country has been at times chequered, yet rarely a few have made it a public issue out of this. Thus, it is that the nation coasts along the narrative of the 5th, the 6th and the 7th pay commission. This happens in different regions concurrently. There are certain States where the State Universities have 62 as the age of retirement whereas the Central Universities in the same State have 65 as the age of retirement. This creates artificial pulls and pressures in the flow of talent of the Faculty and others in a given direction. This also affects the availability of talent in the Central Universities of a given State or the State Universities in a given State.These are not minor matters to be trifled with. However, these issues continue to be treated by default in most situations.In the meanwhile, the so-called discussion on the National Education Policy continues to go on unabated. Most of the comments being made on the National Education Policy, on what it has stated, are so far positive. This is rightly so because the National Education Policy within the limitations of the announcement has indeed given a higher sense of purpose.This keeps the education movement going forward.What does not seem to be noticed, equally, is that there are many aspects of National Education that need an all-India consideration. The above paragraphs given the categories of education at the school stage, the college stage and the university stage, also need some reflection. This is a need that is not yet sufficiently widely understood or appreciated. The greater is the worry because even the commentaries on this in the press are few and far between.That having been said there is a need to keep the discussion on education alive. All said and done, the Parliament needs to find time to take up some of these collateral issues on a truly comprehensive level.The form in which the National Education Policy has been enunciated makes for many valid points. Amongst them number the emphasis on the indigenisation of education and finding the Indian roots of many intellectual traditions. This is valid in science, technology, management, literature, medicine, music and more. This is not going to come easy because Indian intellectual traditions are so much a part of life that one gets away even by ignoring their scholastic tradition in formal educational efforts. This state of dualism where something is recognized as a part of life but does not have its due place in the curriculum, is a hiatus that needs to be bridged.  "
electronic-soil-for-alternative-farming,"The World population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it’s clear that we won’t be able to cover the food demands of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods. But with hydroponics we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings. Research group has now developed an electrically conductive cultivation substrate, tailored to hydroponic cultivation, that they call e-Soil. Hydroponic cultivation means that plants grow without soil, needing only water, nutrients and something their roots can attach to—a substrate. It is a closed system that enables water recirculation so that each seedling gets exactly the nutrients it needs. Therefore, very little water is required and all nutrients remain in the system, which is not possible in traditional cultivation.Hydroponics also enables vertical cultivation in large towers to maximize space efficiency. Crops already being cultivated in this manner include lettuce, herbs and some vegetables. Grains are not typically grown in hydroponics apart for their use as fodder. The researcher’s show that barley seedlings can be cultivated using hydroponics and that they have a better growth rate, thanks to electrical stimulation. “In this way, we can get seedlings to grow faster with fewer resources. We don’t yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it’s not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process.”Mineral wool is often used as cultivation substrate in hydroponics. Not only is this non-biodegradable, it is also produced with a very energy-intensive process. The electronic cultivation substrate e-Soil is made of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, mixed with a conductive polymer called PEDOT. While this mixture is not novel, its application in plant cultivation and as an interface for plants is unprecedented. This combination as such is not new, but this is the first time it has been used for plant cultivation and for creating an interface for plants in this manner. Previous research has used high voltage to stimulate the roots. Eleni Stavrinidou, associate professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics and leader of the Electronic Plants group at Linkoping University, emphasises the urgency of finding new agricultural methods due to the increasing world population and the challenges posed by climate change. The advantage of the Linköping researchers’ “soil” is that it has very low energy consumption and no high voltage danger. Stavrinidou believes that the new study will open the pathway for new research areas to develop further hydroponic cultivation.“We can’t say that hydroponics will solve the problem of food security. But it can definitely help particularly in areas with little arable land and with harsh environmental conditions,” In a new study published in the journal PNAS, researchers from Linkoping University have unveiled an innovative electrically conductive cultivation soil, dubbed e-Soil, which has demonstrated a remarkable ability to enhance the growth of barley seedlings by 50% within just 15 days. This development in hydroponic technology could potentially revolutionise urban farming and contribute significantly to global food security.One of the key benefits of e-Soil is its low energy consumption and the elimination of high voltage risks associated with previous research that used high voltage to stimulate plant roots. The researchers have observed that barley seedlings grown in e-Soil process nitrogen more effectively, although the exact biological mechanisms behind the enhanced growth and electrical stimulation’s role remain to be fully understood. Stavrinidou acknowledges that while hydroponics alone may not solve the problem of food security, it can make a substantial difference, especially in regions with limited arable land and harsh environmental conditions. The study’s findings pave the way for further research into hydroponic cultivation, potentially leading to more efficient food production methods.Researchers from Linköping University in Sweden developed a ‘bioelectronics hydroponic soil’ that can speed up the growth of plants in  hydroponic space, or farms that grow plants without soil in environments made up of mostly water and a place for roots to attach. After integrating the engineered ‘e-Soil’ into the framework where seedlings grow, researchers discovered that sending electrical signals through the soil made plants grow 50 percent more on average. Eleni Stavrinidou, the supervisor of the study, told Engadget that the soil’s conductivity was necessary for stimulating the plant roots. In this particular study, the researchers examined the effect of sending signals to barley seedlings over the span of 15 days before harvesting them for analysis. Applying a voltage as small as 0.5V on the e-Soil electrically stimulates the roots, Stavrinidou explained. This, in turn, resulted in a recordable increase in the biomass of the electrically stimulated plants when compared to the non-stimulated seedlings.The stimulation’s effect on the barley seedlings was described as steady and transient”. Stavrinidou told Engadget that nitrogen, one of the main nutrients involved in plant growth, was processed more efficiently through the stimulation. “We found that the stimulated plants could process the nutrients more efficiently however we don’t understand how the stimulation is affecting this process,” Stavrindou explained, adding that the reason behind the growth process will be a focus of future studies. While hydroponic techniques are mainly used to grow leafy greens and some vegetables like cucumbers and tomatoes, the e-Soil could offer a solution to create new ways to increase crop yields in commercial settings and especially in places where environmental conditions impact plant growth. The study highlights that this technique could minimize the use of fertilizers in farming.But beyond improving crop yield, the implementation of e-Soil in hydroponic farms could make them more energy-conscious. While traditional hydroponic farms use up less water, they require more energy to run. “The e-Soil consumes very little power in the microwatt range,” Stavrinidou said. Before this technology can be applied to large scale agriculture and other types of crops, more studies need to be conducted to observe how electrical stimulation can impact the whole growth cycle of a plant throughout its entire lifespan and not just in the early stages of seedling maturation. Stavrinidou also said that her team plans on studying how the technique affects the growth of other plant species.(Writer can be reached at:sjugeshwor7@gmail,com) "
