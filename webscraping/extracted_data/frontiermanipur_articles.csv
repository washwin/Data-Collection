We, the Meitei Diaspora and our supporters, write to you today with a heavy heart and seek your intervention to end the violence and bring normalcy in Manipur, protect our farmers, and foster enduring peace amongst all the communities in Manipur.As India makes significant strides in development and prepares to host the G20 summit, the persistence of violence in Manipur threatens to undermine these achievements. The ongoing violence in Manipur has fractured the social fabric of the state. As custodians of the aspirations for a united and harmonious Manipur and India, we earnestly implore you to take resolute measures to prevent further escalation of the situation. The people of Manipur deserve lives free from fear, where they can thrive in an atmosphere marked by peace, stability and safety.The turmoil has placed our farmers, the backbone of our society, in grave jeopardy. The tragic incidents of farmers being attacked highlights their predicaments. For instance, on 29 August 2023, Salam Jotin, a 37-year-old farmer was shot by a long-range sniper gun while working at his field at Naranseina, Bishnupur District. The situation has been exacerbated by the displacement of many farmers currently forced to live in relief camps. Manipur is on the verge of a conflict-induced famine and starvation as farmers are not able to work in their fields despite the presence of security forces for their protection.More Stories like thisYUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022YOONGOU LITRE 250 ROM PHAGATTUNA MANGHANKHRESep 4, 2022The ongoing violence has jeopardised the future of thousands of students, forcing them to discontinue their education. These harsh circumstances not only interrupt their current schooling but also cast an immense threat over their future opportunities. Education serves as the foundation for personal advancement and development. When violence forcibly removes this opportunity, it deprives the students of their potential and the possibility of realising their aspirations. This repercussion reverberates beyond individual lives, impeding the progress and prosperity of our society. Putting an end to senseless violence becomes paramount in preserving the dreams and ambitions of our youth.Appeal for Immediate Intervention to Restore Normalcy in ManipurSir, we acknowledge the intricate complexities inherent to our Manipur society – the Meiteis, the Nagas, and the Kuki communities, each with their own unique identities and aspirations. However, the pivotal role of your esteemed office is to serve as a binding force that ensures the protection and progress of every Indian citizen. By initiating meaningful dialogues among these communities, you hold the key to nurturing understanding and collaboration, paving the way for peacefulcoexistence.We implore you to engage personally with the Chief Minister of Manipur and the relevant authorities to restore the normalcy in our Manipur. The innocent people of Manipur have borne the burden of suffering beyond imagination and it is our collective responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being.Sir, as the Leader of our Great Nation, you have the power to shape the destiny of our Manipur and to illuminate the path of effective governance, empathy and bring in the much needed unity of the people of Manipur. We humbly request you to visit Manipur and meet the affected people by this senseless violence and ongoing turmoil.

The dean orders all faculty members, scientists, UG 1yr students and all PG, Ph.D students to attend a Motivational Talk by the former Vice Chancellor, SVPUA&T, Meerut (UP) at CAU Auditorium without failTFM ReportPeople in Manipur seemed to be least bothered about the new wave of Covid though the number of coronavirus positive cases saw a steady rise since June-end. All the market places remained crowded and nobody adhered to covid protocol and safety guidelines.The state government, which was very proactive in instilling covid appropriate behaviours into people, also seemed to have lackadaisical approach to adopting covid control measures, like declaring specific geographic areas as containment or buffer zone to prevent local transmission and contact tracing to break chains of transmission, this time.For instance, a girl student of Central Agricultural University, Imphal tested covid positive on 14 July. Following the report, the dean of the university issued notice on 15 July requesting the students, teaching and non-teaching staff to strictly follow COVID-19 protocols issued by the Government of Manipur and urging them to avoid unnecessary movement outside the college, games and mass gathering.As per the notice, all exams will be conducted as per scheduled by following COVID-19 protocols.

Practical classes are to be conducted in off-line mode by following COVID-19 protocols.In case, anyone experiences COVID-19 symptoms, they must contact the medical team of the college and follow their advice and medication, added the notice.However, no process for contact tracing has been initiated to interrupt chains of transmission. No arrangement for prompt cleaning and disinfection of campus has been made to prevent the spread of the virus.To the surprise of all, dean of the university Prof. Indira Sarangthem issued an order directing to all faculty members, scientists, UG 1yr students and all PG, Ph.D students to attend a Motivational Talk by the former Vice Chancellor, SVPUA&T, Meerut (UP) at CAU Auditorium without fail.Govt giving thrust on vaccination to fight new covid waveInstead of adopting a containment strategy, the central and state governments gave more thrust on vaccination to fight against the new wave of Covid-19 variant. As part of the Central Government’s 75-day COVID Vaccination Amrit Mahotsava, Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh on Friday launched Free-Covid Vaccination of Precaution Dose at a simple function held at CM’s Secretariat.The free-vaccination program for 18 years and above citizens with a target population of 10,18,619 in the state is held under Jan Abhiyan program, as a part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations commemorating 75 years of India’s Independence, said an official.Ministers Dr Sapam Ranjan Singh and L Sushindro Meitei, and concerned officials of Health Services, Manipur also attended the launching of vaccination drive that will culminate on 30 September 2022.However, people are curious about the efficacy of vaccination as coronavirus is picking up steam again in the districts which report high vaccination rates. They wanted the Manipur government’s covid 19 common control room to reveal the number of vaccinated people who got infected in the new covid wave.89 new cases reported, two journalists infectedIn the last 24 hours on Friday, 89 persons (44 male, 45 female) were confirmed as new COVID 19 positive cases in Manipur taking the active caseload to 385, said an official source.

get-it-straight-electoral-politics-and-the-culture-of-violence-in-manipur,"The recent killing of a student in Heirok and all the incidents referred to as pre-poll violence in Manipur have to be understood in the light of prolonged militarization and subsequent inheritance of the culture of violence.By Dhiren A Sadokpam“When we allow violence against some, we enable violence against all.” When Native American writer and progressive activist DaShanne Stokes thought of these lines, he meant much more than what he even thought. And we all know violence begets violence and it is even worse when the very roots of violence are wrongly packaged according to popular conceptions bereft of critical gaze.The shooting and killing of a student, Nigthoujam Rohit of Heirok part-2, Mayai leikai on Tuesday night reportedly by masked men comes after a brief lull in the so called pre-poll related violence in Manipur. These senseless violent incidents should be condemned by one and all. Having said this, there is a need to scrutinize the incidents of violence that keep recurring before the advent and after the assembly elections in a state like Manipur.As reported by TFM, Ningthoujam Premchandra, a 53-year old and father of three sons had retired for the night after having dinner at his home located in Heirok part-2, Mayai leikai on Tuesday (December 21, 2021). At around midnight, the locality was rudely awoken with reverberating sounds of gunshots.Rohit, son of Premchandra heard noises at the back of the house and had opened the door to find out what was happening. The masked men standing nearby, wielding firearms shot him at point blank range with a shotgun. Premchandra rushed towards his son’s side and he too was shot down by the assailants. Rohit died on the way to Raj Medicity Imphal and his father is reported to be still in a critical condition.During the month of October, we had also seen a few incidents of sporadic violence supposedly linked with the forthcoming Manipur Assembly election. The one month following October did not see any major incident that could be termed as dangerous by political observers except the most recent Heirok incident.However, during the first phase of the violence when election moods started swaying the public minds, many political pundits, journalists and even newspapers cherry-picked the phrase “pre-poll violence” to characterize the incidents as they occurred at the dawn of an election season. What was even more interesting to note was that these so called violence took place between the supporters of rival intending candidates for an Assembly election that the Indian Election Commission was yet to schedule.Several academics, public intellectuals, and political party spokespersons expressed their opinions on the issue through the medium of mushrooming online and cable TV Networks in Manipur. Almost all correctly identified violence in any form as a threat to the democratic fabric of the society.However, a larger issue that needs to be addressed with critical lenses is whether or not the pre-poll violence, as we have labelled it, is truly tied to ideological disagreements or conflict between political parties vying to snatch power in the name of electoral democracy. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the issue from multiple perspectives.More Stories like thisRole of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023Manipur Chief Minister Calls for an End to India-Myanmar…Sep 25, 2023Is the violence between groups and individuals we have witnessed in the state in recent months rooted in the ideological differences between the political parties or party allegiance they have supported? The answer is a clear no. Few people are willing to die for any specific political ideology, whether leftist, rightist, or centrist in the true sense of the words. When the season of electioneering begins, senseless violence occurs as a form to terrorize peoplenotnecessarily in the name of political parties but definitely for the candidates whose political affiliations are known by how close one is to the powers that be. Or perhaps, to settle score with the enemies that was pending for long.Hence, it is imperative to look for the source of the violence elsewhere. We have obfuscated the root cause of the violence by pigeonholing it as electoral violence as if the battle turf was made for settling ideological differences. Most of us view the issue through the lenses of election season and tensions that arise between supporters of rival parties.There are also people who argue that ideological conflicts between opposing parties sparked these violent pre-poll incidents. Here, we must not lose sight of the fact that in a state like Manipur, someone who was a member of an ideologically left-wing party yesterday could become a conservative and right-wing party member today. Political party allegiance and Electoral politics in Manipur have over the years rendered party ideologies totally irrelevant.Therein lies the importance of looking beyond electoral perspectives and focusing on historical, political, cultural, and psychological factors. The history of political violence as we understand in modern Manipur may be traced back to the post-1949 period, when the seeds of violent political confrontation between the state and non-state actors, known as ‘Naharol gi Ehou,’ were sown. As such, our people have lived for a long time in a violent atmosphere where non-state actors have attempted to draw the attention of any regimes. While the state’s response had been the attempt to protect the bigger political structure, everything that happens in the state, from domestic violence to mob violence, must be examined in the context of Manipur’s violent political landscape and resultant fear since the 1940s.Assuming the recent violence “near or within” in our social context as mere electoral violence is hugely mechanical in nature. So to avoid unwanted and irreparable impact on the democratic fabric of society, there is a need to find out the cause of the violence by dissecting them from multiple possibilities.If we go back over the last one hundred years, we can see that a new culture of violence had been ingrained in the society. When one dissects the anatomy of violence in Manipur in a wider sense, we can find two types. The first one is violence caused by the conflict between state and the non-state actors. The violence perpetrated by non-state actors or those who do not want Manipur to be a part of India has been referred to as illegitimate violence whereas violence sanctioned and perpetrated by the state to protect its larger political structure is referred to as legitimate violence. Yet, the crucial point here is that either way, whether it is state induced violence or violence committed by non-state actors, both types impose “internalized violent mindsets” in the people.However, the election-triggered violence that we are discussing right now in Manipur has more to do with money and muscle power, as well as the notion of “challenge” pushed forth by dominance-subservience mindset imbedded in our tradition over the last few centuries as a result of historical circumstances. Here, one can note that practically all the violent incidents discussed here have eventually and legally take “individualized forms”. The only reason we call it electoral or poll violence is because of the temporal factor in sequence. Even a disagreement between two brothers or two families or feud between clans can be read as political violence during election season. This despite the fact that a long standing dispute had nothing to do with the electoral exercise. In this sense, most of the violence we have seen is symptomatic of a culture of violence beyond the confines of Assembly elections. And we too have inherited a distorted form of electoral politics.The culture being referred to here does not mean the pristine idea of culture or tradition. Rather, it refers to the acquired violent psychological state of a community whose members are lodged in a geopolitical landscape perforated by militarization and protracted armed political unrest. This underlying culture of violence may be dormant, but it manifests itself in various forms, whether individualized or institutionalized depending on spatial and temporal contingencies.In claiming that we are inherently violent in character, it does not imply that every member of the society is a raging beast ready to attack one and all. Mob violence in our society for instance is a good example of how inherently violent we people are due to a variety of historical factors. No one seem to think that mobs are logic-less, cultureless, or tradition-less as they are constituent parts of a society. Objective material conditions and prolonged state of militarization have eventually determined their characters. The collective frustration and repressed anger must be taken into account when studying actions expressed in a violent form. Thus, the culture of violence is deeply embedded in our society propelled by extraordinary militarization. The consequences can be fatal in the long run.(Dhiren A.

shady-role-of-eci-in-manipurs-electoral-process-a-systemic-failure-of-government,"One of the fundamental roles of the ECI is to guarantee that candidates who seek to contest elections meet stringent eligibility criteria.By Kaoba LuwangThe democratic fabric of India is woven together by the tireless efforts of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is entrusted with the solemn duty of ensuring that the world’s largest democracy conducts elections that are free, fair, and untainted. However, recent events have cast a dark shadow over the ECI’s reputation, as systemic failures due to corruption have emerged, posing a grave threat to the very foundations of Indian democracy.One of the fundamental roles of the ECI is to guarantee that candidates who seek to contest elections meet stringent eligibility criteria. These criteria, encompassing age, citizenship, and legal qualifications, are in place to safeguard the electoral process from unqualified individuals seeking power. A critical part of this process is the scrutiny of nomination papers filed by candidates, which is designed to identify any discrepancies or omissions that might compromise the integrity of the elections.Yet, the glaring failure of the ECI to properly scrutinize Kuki candidates with documented links to militant groups from Myanmar during Manipur Assembly elections raises disturbing questions about the commission’s commitment to its mandate. One of the candidates allowed to run early on was Pu L. Singsit, a leader of the Kuki People’s Front (KPF), who had previously been associated with the Kuki National Organization (KNO), a militant group advocating for an independent Kuki homeland.This lapse in judgment has rightfully drawn criticism from various quarters, raising concerns about bias and partiality within the ECI. Such incidents threaten to erode the faith of the Indian electorate in the electoral process and undermine the democratic principles upon which the nation is built.Furthermore, allegations of the involvement of Manipur legislators, particularly Kuki MLAs, with Kuki militant groups operating under the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement have added another layer of complexity to the issue. It is essential to question whether these legislators played a role in inciting violence to further their political agendas, highlighting the urgent need for a thorough investigation and a renewed commitment to restoring the integrity of India’s electoral process.The Manipur Political-Militant NexusManipur has faced decades of insurgency, with various militant groups seeking autonomy or secession from India. The nexus between some MLAs and militant leaders has been a longstanding issue, raising questions about the role of these elected representatives in perpetuating instability in the state. These connections are often based on mutual benefits, including financial support during elections and protection from the militants themselves.Several Manipur legislators, particularly Kuki MLAs, have direct or indirect connections to Kuki militant groups. These connections raise serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest and loyalties, which demand scrutiny:Thanglianpau Guite:President of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) and former MP candidate in Myanmar, Guite’s leadership of a militant group under the SoO agreement raises questions about his involvement in Manipur’s political landscape.Khenchin:Vice President and Secretary of ZRA, Chin’s alleged affiliations with an armed group operating under the SoO framework have raised concerns.General P. S. Haokip:Chairman of the Kuki National Army (KNA), Haokip’s background and position warrant further scrutiny as per political observers.Mr. David Hangshing:President of the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA) and spouse of Kimneo Haokip, a sitting MLA, their connection raises significant concerns.Mr. St. Thangboi Kipgen:Chairman of the Kuki National Front (KNF) and United People’s Front, married to Mrs. Nemcha Kipgen, the current Minister of Commerce and Industry in Manipur, prompting questions about conflicts of interest.Kimneo Haokip Hangshing:MLA from Saikul Assembly Constituency, founded the Kuki People’s Alliance (KPA), a political party allegedly associated with the militant organization KNA/KNO.More Stories like thisInvasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024Bidyananda sent to police custody for five more daysFeb 10, 2024Outlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Chinlunthang Zou:MLA representing Singnat Assembly Constituency, affiliated with KPA and a member of the KNA.Vungzagin Valte:MLA for Thanlon Assembly constituency, allegedly associated with ZRA.Paulienlel Haokip:MLA representing Saikot Assembly Constituency, allegedly serves as an advisor to KNA.Nemcha Kipgen:MLA from Kangpokpi Assembly Constituency, spouse of ST Thangboi Kipgen, President of KNF.The implications of this nexus are severe. Manipur’s political landscape becomes a breeding ground for corruption, drug trade and a challenge to democratic values. Elected officials are expected to serve the interests of their constituents, not engage in deals with militant groups that undermine the state’s security and integrity. The involvement of MLAs in such activities erodes the trust citizens place in their elected representatives and the democratic process itself.Allegations of Corruption within the ECIAnother critical issue plaguing Manipur’s political scene is the allegations of corruption within the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ECI is responsible for overseeing free and fair elections in the country. When allegations of corruption within this institution emerge, it strikes at the heart of India’s democratic processes.Claims of manipulation of electoral outcomes through financial incentives, voter suppression, and electoral malpractices have been made. These allegations cast doubt on the legitimacy of election results and hinder the ability of Manipur’s citizens to elect representatives who genuinely represent their interests.The Importance of AccountabilityAddressing these interconnected problems in Manipur is vital for several reasons. First and foremost, the integrity of India’s democracy is at stake. A functioning democracy relies on transparency, accountability, and trust in the electoral process. When elected officials are alleged to have links with militants and when the body responsible for conducting elections faces corruption allegations, it undermines the very foundation of democracy.Moreover, the security of the nation is in jeopardy. Manipur’s instability has repercussions not only for the state but also for the entire country. The links between politicians and militants can facilitate illegal activities, including arms smuggling and drug trafficking. Failing to address these issues promptly risks being perceived as complicity by the highest authorities in the government, further eroding trust in state institutions.Implications and the Call for InvestigationThe implications of these connections are grave. Elected officials are expected to serve their constituents, not engage in deals with militant groups. Such alliances erode public trust in democracy and raise concerns about the security of the nation.Furthermore, allegations of corruption within the ECI compound these problems. Claims of electoral manipulation through financial incentives, voter suppression, and malpractices undermine the legitimacy of election outcomes. Trust in the electoral process and the democratic principles upon which India stands is eroding.To restore confidence in India’s electoral system and protect the nation’s security, a thorough investigation into these allegations is imperative. Those found guilty, whether within the political realm or the ECI, must be held accountable under the National Security Act. Infiltration within the government cannot be ignored, and failure to address these issues promptly could be perceived as complicity at the highest levels.The time has come for India’s democratic institutions to demonstrate their unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. The Election Commission of India must regain its tarnished reputation and ensure that the electoral process remains free, fair, and untainted. The fate of Indian democracy hangs in the balance.(Kaoba Luwang is a freelance. The opinion expressed here does not represent the views of TFM)"

Till today, no one knows who fired the fatal shots that killed them.By Tennoson Pheirei, TFM Ukhrul CorrespondentTill today, no one knows who fired the fatal shots that killed Mayopam Ramror and Ramkashing Vashi on 30 August 2014. The rallyists who were standing along with the two deceased reported that the gun was shot from the b-hole of the passing armoured vehicle.Rosedinah Ramror, wife of late Mayopam Ramror, in her speech during the funeral programme of her husband held at TNL Ground, Ukhrul on 1 September 2014 lamented that “Though my beloved husband life has been cut short by Manipur state security forces, I beg Naga people not to forsake me and the baby I am carrying in my womb. The lost of a lover and a husband is something I can’t imagine and bear. However, I will take solace and comfort knowing he sacrificed and gave up his life for the greater cause. My heart is heavy.”At that time, Rosedinah wife of Mayopam was only 26 years old and Chanreiwon wife of Ramkashing was only 24 years old and both were pregnant at that time and they gave birth to a baby boy and baby girl respectively in the following months.On August 30, 2014, the United Naga Council (UNC) had called for a public rally in Ukhrul demanding expedition of the settlement of the Indo-Naga issue; respect for the Indo-Naga ceasefire agreement; to honour the democratic dialogue on alternative arrangement between the Government of Manipur (GoM) and UNC; to stop militarization, and to respect land rights of the Nagas amongst others.The rally was opposed by the GoM on the grounds that it would endanger public peace; and a huge contingent of police forces and commandos from other districts (Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur) were also dispatched to Ukhrul town.The rally had started from two main landmarks of Ukhrul Town -Kharasom Junction and Dungrei Junction, and converged at the Tangkhul Naga Long (TNL) Ground. As the group from Kharasom Junction marched towards TNL Ground, police forces allegedly opened fire at Mission Ground, Alungtang injuring many. The police actions soon spread to other parts of Ukhrul Town with teargases, mock bombs and live bullets fired indiscriminately.Mayopam Ramror and Ramkashing Vashi were part of the crowd which had gathered near TNL Ground, waiting for the arrival of other groups to converge. They were shot by state security forces in a passing armoured car reportedly from a close range and they both succumbed to their injuries at the spot. Till today, no one knows who fired the fatal shots that killed them. Rallyist who were standing along with the two deceased report that the gun was shot from the b-hole of the passing armor vehicle.Due to indiscriminate firing by the Commandos and IRB two people were killed and 34 were critically injured. M. Ngachonmi S/o M. David of Somdal Village was referred to Imphal for treatment. Ramchanngam Horam S/o Helpson Horam of Kharasom Village received bullet injury on the right leg, Ningkhan Luikham S/o David Luikham of Kongkan Village was hit by tear gas on the left hand, Khanreingam LK S/o Yangmi LK of Leiting Village recieved bullet injury on the right hand, Shangkahao Keishing S/o (L) Thomas Keishing of Thoyee Village received tear gas injury on the left knee and a tear gas exploded on the face of Ningshim L.S. of Hunphun.Besides, SK.

The post mortem started at 02:30pm and was completed at 05:30pm. The post mortem was conducted on August 31, 2014 by two forensic specialists who came from Imphal and was accompanied by two doctors from Ukhrul Hospital. The whole process was captured in video camera. However, a request for a third party to take the footage was not allowed.As per the post mortem reports, a 9mm bullet was found inside the body of Ramkashing Vashi. In the case of Mayopam Ramror, the bullet entered from the left side of his back and passed through the right side of the neck. This post mortem only re-confirmed that they died from bullet injury and not from tear gas injury as reported by certain media.The Nagas under UNC on September 1, 2014 while condemning in the strongest term, the killings and violence of the Government of Manipur perpetrated on the Nagas in Manipur on August 30, 2014 at Ukhrul declared that “Late Mayopam Ramror and Late Ramkashing Vashi of Teinem Village are hereby declared martyrs of the Naga cause and will be honored as such for all time to come.”It also took a decision for “political boycott of the Government of Manipur in Naga areas including an indefinite ban on all construction work on national projects in Naga areas and ban on all vehicular traffic along National and State Highways in Naga areas to will enforced till such time the Government of India makes a political intervention on our situation with effect from 06:00am of September 4, 2014.”An appeal letter, addressed to Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi by 12507 citizens of Ukhrul as signatories was also submitted on September 8, 2014. The mass signatures campaign called for urgent attention to the issue to prevent the escalation of violence and to bring back normalcy, centrally-constituted judicial investigation into the incident and also the preceding events and immediate withdrawal of the Manipur Police Commando (MPC) and Indian Reserved Battalion (IRB) from in and around Ukhrul District, Manipur. The following day, IRBs and Commandos stationed at various places of Ukhrul District were withdrawn.Today, Rosedinah who is 35 years now is still looking for answers. Speaking to this correspondent, Rosedinah narrated what had happened in 2014 that “it has been 9 years and I will never know who pulled the trigger and killed my husband. I want to know everything that happened on that day. I was pregnant that time and was at home when the incident happened. Family and friends informed me that he was shot in the arms. I desperately tried calling his number. After trying for many times, my elder brother picked up the phone and told me to be calm, he was being given treatment at the hospital and would be back in the evening.”“In the evening, relatives and friends started pouring in to our house. Sensing fear that something drastic might have happened, I enquired one of my relatives to tell me what actaully had happened to my husband. She did not say anything, but, I realised something worst had happened because I noticed tears trickling down from her eyes when she turned away from me. It was only late in the evening that they broke me the actual news that he was no more”.“Our son Ngahanngai Ramror is going to be 9 years soon. He wishes he has someone to call Āvā (father). Sometimes, while coming back home after playing with his friends, he would suddenly ask where was his father? I tried to explain but no words came out. Only tears. It is very painful to explain to my son. I have shown him the grave at TNL Ground, where he was buried along with his friend Ramkashing Vashi. I am yet to explain how he died. When he grows older, I will surely tell the story. For now I can only meet his queries with silence and tears”.Rosedinah Ramror is a single mom who would drop her son in the morning and pick her son after the school who is now studying in class III and rush home for the chore at home.The pain and suffering still persist narrated Chanreiwon Vashi, wife of late Ramkashing Vashi. “on that fateful day, I was at home waiting for my husband to come back home. I had boiled hot water for his bath. I was pregnant that time and gave birth to our daughter on December 4, 2014. I got to know suddenly that my husband was no more when two elders from our village came and informed the news to my in-laws. My daughter is almost 9 years now and is studying Class III at Sacred Heart Higher Secondary School, Ukhrul. I long to know what actually happened that day, who killed my husband. I have accepted that he gave his life for a noble cause and that solace and comfort is enough to forgive the killer.”Chanreiwon Vashi runs a garment shop at Ukhrul to support their son and meet their daily expense.Justice seems far away for the families and loved ones of Mayopam and Ramkashing. They have to move on with time, yet, they seem to be stuck at that point of time when their lives were cruelly ended.Today, in a simple programme, the 9th Martyrs Day of Mayopam and Ramkashing was held on Wednesday at the burial side. The programme was led by President of Tangkhul Naga Long and TNL Phungva. Wreath laying was taken up at the burial site and TNL leaders pays homagae and respect to the two fallen heroes."

The Commission said it will subsequently review the situation and issue further instructions accordingly.The election commission said physical rallies during the campaign period as and when permitted after the decision of the Commission shall be conducted subject to adherence to extant COVID-19 guidelines. The maximum limit of persons allowed for Indoor and outdoor rally/meeting shall be as per existing direction of respective SDMAs.However, since the day the election commission had announced the poll schedule and restricted election-related gatherings, Covid cases are steadily on the rise. The crest of the third wave is likely to overlap with peaking of the election campaign.As per ECI announcement, Manipur assembly elections will conducted on two phases. First phase voting is scheduled for February 27 and the second phase March 3. Last date for filing nomination for phase-I is February 8 and for phase-II February 11. Scrutiny will be held on February 9 and February 14 for phase-I and phase-II respectively. Counting of votes will take place on March 10.Meanwhile, experts have predicted the peak of the third wave between February 1 and 15. According to a preliminary analysis by IIT Madras, India’s R-naught value which indicates the spread of COVID-19 was recorded at 4 this week, suggesting a very high infection transmission rate. Dr Jayant Jha, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras, said that as per their estimate, the peak in the current wave is expected to come between February 1-15 and it is expected to be sharper than earlier peaks.If their prediction turns out to be correct, Manipur will go to polls at the peak of covid-19 third wave."
eliminating-light-pollution-essential-for-ecological-integrity-and-human-health-iucn,"The IUCN report cites the example of the Hortobagy National Park, the second largest alkaline grassland in Europe, which covers 82,000 ha on the flood plain of the Tisza River. The Park managers established lighting regulations based on the RASC/IDA Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting, ensuring an environment free of light pollution, which is highly essential for the wildlife thriving in the Park.By Salam Rajesh“Light pollution is the human-caused alteration of outdoor light levels from those occurring naturally. It threatens ecological and commemorative integrity, interferes with amateur and research astronomy, degrades the appreciation of mythologies and cultural practices related to the night sky, mars wilderness experience and landscape beauty, carries risks to human health and wastes energy”.The statement comes as a process of an emerging campaign by international bodies for the elimination of light pollution across the globe, as is outlined in the IUCN publication “The World at Night: Preserving natural darkness for heritage conservation and night sky appreciation” (2004).Light pollution is a relatively new area of deliberation in an obscure region like North East India where there is less of discussion on the proceedings of the subsidiary bodies of the United Nations, far more pronounced in Manipur particularly where the State is yet to deal appropriately with issues on air and water pollution.The IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020, at its session in Marseille, France, had specifically called upon its member organizations and the specialized Commissions to work towards reducing light pollution globally.The world body while urging all concerned to ‘ensure the protection of the nocturnal environment’, appealed to all of its member organizations and agencies for the ‘management of land and water areas to develop, disseminate and implement engagement, education and outreach programs to explain the harmful impacts of light pollution, the benefits of preserving natural darkness, and the methods to reduce light pollution’.With the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development of France in the lead, the IUCN plunged into action to reduce light pollution reminding member organizations that ‘the impacts of artificial light at night affect many biological groups, both flora and fauna, vertebrate and non-vertebrate, and affect the functioning of ecosystems and the free services that they provide to human societies, including pollination’.More Stories like thisInvasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024Outlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Alas! Woe to Manipur: Nine months into endless killings with…Feb 4, 2024The IUCN report emphasizes that ‘birds are seriously affected by light pollution. They may suffer navigation problems from night lights during migration and become disoriented, tending to fly toward bright lights. The death toll from collisions with lights or brightly lit windows and buildings has generated public concern over the accumulation of dead birds at the base of brightly lit towers. Their feeding habits, particularly of those that eat flying insects, can suffer from the effects of light pollution on their own behaviour as well as that of the insects upon which they feed’.The report further stresses that ‘insects, too, suffer disorientation and death from attraction to artificial lights. Their numbers also decrease as they congregate under bright lights and become easy prey for insect-eating birds. Insects suffer losses due to the interruption of their normal breeding habits by light pollution.On this very note, the report points out that ‘the impacts of light wavelengths on biological groups are very diverse (e.g. orientation, growth, phototaxis, circadian clock, activity modification) and that a biological group can be affected by several types of impact’.The IUCN report is also specific on the fact that ‘artificial lighting disrupts the orientation of many animal species with severe adverse effects (marine turtles, migrating birds, etc.) and reduces the quality of habitats and connectivity within landscapes, with consequences for the viability of populations.The IUCN report cites the example of the Hortobagy National Park, the second largest alkaline grassland in Europe, which covers 82,000 ha on the flood plain of the Tisza River. The Park managers established lighting regulations based on the RASC/IDA Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting, ensuring an environment free of light pollution, which is highly essential for the wildlife thriving in the Park. Hortobagy supports 159 nesting species and 178 regular or irregular visiting species. Every year around 100,000 to 300,000 grey geese (Anser spp.), 100,000 cranes (Grus grus), and 50,000 to 200,000 shorebirds stop at Hortobagy.Citing a case study in Manipur’s Loktak Ramsar site which is an important feeding ground for thousands of transboundary migratory water birds flying in along two international flyways – the Central Asian Flyway and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway – the fishing community of Champu Khangpok Floating Island Village, a unique floating island village within Loktak Lake, raised a campaign to halt the illegal practice of night time fishing using brightly lit LED lights. The campaign had two-prong appeal: first, stop overexploitation of the fish resource, and secondly, stop disrupting the migratory water birds in their feeding season.Taking advantage of the covid-19 restrictions, which nonetheless impacted the livelihoods of the locals drastically during the lockdown period of 2020 and 2021, there was profusion in night time fishing with LED lights, literally turning Loktak into a ‘city of lights’. The Champu Khangpok villagers’ relentless campaign significantly checked the undesired practice, with now only a few erring fishers here and there on the sly.Taking a leaf out of the Hortobagy experience, the Loktak Lake managers requires to strategize a policy for ensuring strict compliance to regulations and halt any form of activity that contributes to light pollution, especially within the Loktak Ramsar site during the migration period of the long-distance flying water birds, many arriving from European destinations, from Siberia and the Far East.It may be recalled that until the year 2012, light pollution as a subject of concern did not feature in any of the IUCN conventions. During the Members’ Assembly held as a process of the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2012 in Jeju, Republic of Korea, a motion to adopt a recommendation “Dark skies and nature conservation” was introduced by the InterEnvironment Institute, a US-based IUCN Member.The motion moved by the international organization was based on the work of the IUCN Dark Skies Advisory Group, part of the Urban Conservation Strategies Specialist Group of the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). Similarly, the Members’ Assembly as part of the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 in Marseille, France, adopted a strong resolution “Taking action to reduce light pollution”. This since, has paved the path for a larger discussion on light pollution as detrimental to ecological integrity, wildlife, and human health in general."

biased-media-coverage-deepens-manipur-crisis,"I would also like to hold the Manipur State Government responsible for such skewed narratives running rampant in the early days of the conflict.By Urus NingthemchaFirst and foremost I would like to make it clear that I’m writing this open letter to all the media houses in the country as a commoner of Manipur. Also request you to not colour me up as someone with a lopsided view, biased towards certain section of Manipuri society. I’ve been witnessing most of the media houses in India pushing a one sided narrative which is a bit lenient towards the Kuki community since the last three months. I, being a Meetei would have loved to have an unbiased covering of the undesirable political conflict taking place in Manipur. Yes, it looks really good when the narrative that “a minority community is being hegemonized by the dominant majority community” is run across the media platforms of the country. It makes it easier to sensationalize the event to grab more eyeballs for TRP or readership. But as a Manipuri it really saddens me when this kind of uneven narrative is being pushed which defeats the very purpose of the existence of news media outlets in India. Also it damages the image of one community more than the other without actually bringing out the truth and hence finding it difficult to bring forth a solution to the crisis.More Stories like thisOutlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Alas! Woe to Manipur: Nine months into endless killings with…Feb 4, 2024Wails Of The Antlers, Silence Of The SaviourFeb 4, 2024And partly I would also like to hold the Manipur State Government responsible for such skewed narratives running rampant in the early days of the conflict. From 4thMay, 2023 onwards the internet was shut down in Manipur, later on it came to limelight that internet was not entirely banned in Churachandpur district throughout the first one and half month since the conflict broke out. Here, I would like to question the state machinery why such failure in executing the ban and also why the ban on internet in 21stcentury. These days the right to internet is akin to the right to basic human rights. Why in India this is the “go-to strategy” whenever some unrests take place? Doesn’t it show the lack of capability of containing a crisis without taking away the basic right to information, especially so in today’s time on the state’s part? This led to the Kukis having a massive advantage in propagating their false narrative left, right and centre. As a result the Meeteis were demonized in the initial days, thanks to some conscientious independent journalist and some renowned Meetei intellectuals the air was cleared a bit.Even now it is a humongous task for Meeteis to debunk so many false narratives as the Kukis even tried to rewrite history in their favour many a time. The mainstream media are not even giving the political crisis in Manipur enough weightage, forget the media even the PM has kept mum throughout. He broke his silence only when a ghastly video went viral, at that time also he didn’t talk about ending the violence but maligned the Meeteis in front of the whole world. So, why this selective response? The next time he spoke was when the “no confidence motion” was raised by the opposition, at that time also he kept on blabbering about inconsequential matters till the time the opposition walked out. Only then he spoke on Manipur and ended with nothing to bet on. Here, I would like to point out that many horrible incidents took place on both the sides and if the media really want to bring out the truth then cover all and let the whole world know how terrifying and inhumane the crisis really is. And the best way to stop all these is to pressure the parliamentarians to take up some solid measures to end it all without further escalation.My humble request to all the responsible media channels is to stop being so biased and try to comprehend the ground reality first before reporting anything. To do this you need to synthesize all the information coming from different sources after carefully filtering out the nonsense of any kind. You all also need not be so impatient for the scoops and jump the gun without realising the cultural, historical and political sensibilities of Manipur. I hope you have quite a clear idea on the impact that your coverage and reports are making worldwide and act accordingly. I simply want this cacophony to be over and have rationality back with all of us to be able to bring a solution to this crisis and have the old lovely and peaceful Manipur back."
manipur-unrest-give-thought-to-your-choice-during-elections,"As a youth, we must understand the complexity of the issue happening in our beautiful State. We must dive deep into the core issue. We must not blindly follow what our elders are doing till now… To conserve our future, we must campaign for NOTA, until we find the right person.By Loya-Ngamba SapamIn the aftermath of the battle of Gettysburg, the American Civil War’s deadliest battle, Abraham Lincoln made an address contouring the ideal and mechanism of democracy. In his speech dedicated to the martyrs of soldiers, he famously pronounced democracy is a government “of the people, by the people and for the people”. His speech evoked the essence of the people in the democratic form of government. It clearly laid down the inevitable fabric that connects the government and its citizens. This fabric is not a mere superficial but rather, a deeply intertwined between the electors and their elected representatives in the nation’s assembly or parliament.Loosening the fabricThe intertwined fabric, which is the basis for having a successful democracy, gets saggy or loosened up between the electors of Manipur and their elected representatives in both Houses of Parliament. The state has been reeling under the deadliest ethnic conflict in its history between the Meitei, a prominent valley-dweller, and the Kuki, one of the hill-dwellers. However, their elected representatives, who should convey people’s plight, remained mute not only in one session but in two consecutive sessions of the Parliament, both monsoon and winter sessions. It transpired when the people in the State protested, demanding to speak up and raise the issue of deleterious crisis to the Parliament. In some interviews, one elected representative claimed that he was being gagged by some externalities. So, he had to drop the people’s will to raise the matter to the Parliament. This not only disconnects limited to the state’s elected members of parliament (MPs) but also manifests among the other MPs as well.More Stories like this2024 Census shows Loktak Waterbird Count lowest in DecadeFeb 24, 2024Manipur HC withdraws contentious portion in its March 2023…Feb 22, 2024Invasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024The session adjourned several times in both Houses of Parliament, particularly the monsoon session, literally without any fruitful debate over the crisis in Manipur, even though the session was held at a time when there was a huge crisis in the state. The people were butchered, their bodies mutilated, women paraded naked and fueling hatred by the social media platforms. The lack of concerted efforts to have a debate in the Parliament reflects the tardy approach of elected MPs to contain the wildfire, particularly the MPs in the ruling party. This apathy makes the people in the State feel the wicked stepmother attitude of the parliament. This will prolong the wound of persistent unfair treatment and discrimination faced by the people of the North Eastern States of India, especially by the people of Manipur. In the long run, the unfair treatment of the Parliament will create resentment or bitterness among the people, particularly the youth affected by the crisis. It has seeded the plant of bitterness, which will further the regionalism and may pose a threat to the social and political integration of the nation. The already broken link between the electors and their elected MPs became widened due to ineffective and inefficient handling of crises by the governments at the Centre and State.In fact, the inefficiency of BJP-led governments at the Centre and State has been credited for stretching the ethnic conflict. So far, the state government led by Biren Singh has not rolled out a specific policy approach to contain the crisis. Many lives would have been saved if the government deployed effective measures and strategies. The wound is deep but, the government is giving only the first aid. A crisis of such magnitude needs not only lip service but also concrete and well-laid-out plans. The policy must focus not only on short-term but also long-term strategies.The NOTA campaignWhen the people of the State were being beheaded, butchered, murdered, mutilated or women were raped and paraded naked, dishonoured their dignity, school kids were captured, tortured and even not able to find their dead bodies, the MPs in both Houses, both in government or Opposition, turned their blind eyes and didn’t turn up when people are asking for their help to resolve the crisis. Why should we still vote for merciless people? Why should we exercise our right guaranteed under Article 326 of the Indian Constitution to elect such a person who turned a blind eye during our needs? Moreover, reports have shown that 43% of MPs in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were linked to criminal cases, why should we give power to people who committed crimes? We need to rethink our electoral choices. Isn’t it worth exercising our choice to NOTA rather than to merciless criminals? To conserve our future, we must campaign for NOTA, until we find the right person.As a youth, we must understand the complexity of the issue happening in our beautiful State. We must dive deep into the core issue. We must not blindly follow what our elders are doing till now. The complexity will grow further if we don’t give thought to our choice of vote. It is time to question whether the candidate filing for MPs or state assembly is right or wrong, whether the candidate is coming to serve the people or harm the people, or whether she/he is coming to have personal gain or not and many more. We should ask as many questions as possible to make a correct decision. If we don’t find the right feat for our candidate, why don’t we go for NOTA? It is better to live in an ordered state, rather than to live in a state governed by merciless criminals. In addition to putting an end to community animosity, the collective “right decision” will inspire a new generation of leaders who will be able to carry out the wishes of the people.(Loya-Ngamba Sapam is an alumnus of IIT Delhi and can be contacted at[email protected])"

Despite the well-intentioned “War on Drugs” initiative launched by the state government in 2022, the thriving trade of poppy and cannabis cultivation continues to plague Manipur. Furthermore, the recent escalation of ethnic violence intricately linked to the drug trade has created a dire situation that calls for swift and decisive action.To address the pressing issues of the current crisis, the need of the hour is a strategic intervention by the Indian Army. This intervention has become indispensable to eradicate the illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation that has become the root cause of much of the present turmoil.Manipur’s ongoing ethnic tensions have severely impeded the efforts of the state police in combating the illicit drug trade and executing the “War on Drugs.” Apparently, with an aim to restore peace, an Indian Army-administered buffer zone has been established to control the violence between the two warring factions in Manipur, but its placement has unintentionally facilitated an uninterrupted proliferation of poppy and cannabis cultivation in the hills. This inadvertent consequence has complicated the state’s fight against narcotics. The buffer zone’s strategic location has hindered the state forces’ access to the hill regions, allowing poppy and cannabis cultivation to flourish unchecked.With the approaching poppy harvest season in the winter, from December to February, the situation is poised to worsen. The entire mechanism for these illicit activities is presently cranked up and poised for this upcoming harvest. If the harvest is successful, then all the illicit activities associated with the drug industry will escalate without restraint. The buffer zone’s unanticipated repercussions have emboldened cultivators and traffickers to operate with impunity. This undermines thestate’s anti-narcotics efforts and necessitates immediate action to prevent an even more significant crisis from unfolding.Given the intricate complexities of the drug trade and the operational expertise of the Indian Army, its intervention has become a paramount necessity.The army’s resources and logistical capabilities are uniquely suitable to dismantle the drug cartel infrastructure supporting this illegal trade. The urgent need for elimination of illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation aligns with the state government’s commitment to combating drug-related problems and also sends a resolute strong message to traffickers. First, it would send a clear message to the drug traffickers that their activities will not be tolerated.Second, it would weaken the nexus between drug trafficking and militant activities. Third, it would improve the security and stability in the State of Manipur. Close cooperation between the state and central governments is crucial for the army’s effective intervention. Timely and accurate intelligence sharing is pivotal to identify high-priority areas for dismantling illegal plantations.The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in India grants significant authority to the Army when operating in designated “disturbed areas.” However, it’s ironic that these powers, instead of being unrestricted, seem to be subject to directives from the central government. A striking example is the current situation in the hills of Manipur, where illegal poppy plantations are thriving, seemingly with the knowledge of the nearby Army deployments.Surprisingly, the Army is choosing to look the other way, citing the need for specific orders from higher authorities before taking action, despite the rampant illicit drug activities in the state. Unfortunately, this seems to be the implicit stance of the currently deployed Army in the said buffer zone in Manipur.More Stories like thisBlast, arson attacks rock Imphal amid Manipur unrestFeb 24, 20242024 Census shows Loktak Waterbird Count lowest in DecadeFeb 24, 2024Manipur HC withdraws contentious portion in its March 2023…Feb 22, 2024This raises a fundamental question:Shouldn’t the Army have the autonomy to independently respond to unlawful activities in AFSPA-governed regions? On the other hand, the Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force operating under the Ministry of Home Affairs, has a significant history of providing assistance in the Northeastern region of India. This force has played a crucial role in both natural disaster relief efforts and combating the drug trade in the area.In 2005, they conducted a massive rescue operation in the wake of a devastating earthquake in Sikkim, saving thousands of stranded individuals. In 2016, during severe floods in Assam and Meghalaya, they provided essential relief and assistance to affected victims. Similarly, in 2017, they rescued hundreds of people trapped in the aftermath of landslides in Manipur, showcasing their commitment to aiding civilians in times of crisis.In addition to their disaster relief initiatives, the Assam Rifles has actively engaged in combating drug trafficking in the Northeastern region. Notable recent instances include a joint operation with the Manipur Police in December 2022, resulting in the seizure of a significant quantity of drugs valued at Rs 500 crore in the international market in Moreh town, Manipur. In January 2023, they successfully intercepted a consignment of heroin worth Rs 200 crore in Mizoram, followed by the apprehension of a drug smuggler in Nagaland in February 2023, along with a substantial consignment of heroin valued at Rs 100 crore.Unfortunately, it’s worth noting that, at present, there appear to be no such ongoing activities for the destruction of poppy and cannabis plantations in the hills of Manipur where AFSPA is implemented. Since the outbreak of violence on March 3rd, the state government’s “War on Drugs” initiative has come to a halt, and the involvement of the army in this regard is yet to be seen.When confronted with such unlawful activities within AFSPA-designated regions, the appropriate protocol is clear: the Army must expediently inform the central government and await specific directives. The central government, in turn, shoulders the responsibility of responding impartially and void of political motives. In navigating the intricate landscape of illicit activities like poppy and cannabis plantations within AFSPA-designated areas of Manipur, the central government’s actions must be guided by principles of fairness and neutrality.Ensuring that decisions align with the best interests of the populace rather than catering to political agendas is crucial. The central government must exercise restraint and avoid exploiting the AFSPA’s authority for ulterior motives. Failure by the Central Government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue explicit and timely orders for army intervention raises a troubling possibility of government involvement in perpetuating the drug trade and ethnic violence. The silence or inaction of these governmental bodies could be interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the ongoing illegal activities that pose a threat to Manipur’s security and harmony.In the event that the Indian Army hesitates to carry out orders from the Ministry of Home Affairs, it may lead the public to question the army’s involvement or complicity in the drug trade. Given the Indian Army’s esteemed reputation for integrity, it is imperative that they demonstrate an unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and national security by adhering to legal directives aimed at eradicating illegal activities.If the Indian Army undertakes the task of eliminating the illegal poppy and cannabis plantations, it is crucial that this intervention is thorough and comprehensive. Breaking the backbone of ongoing violence requires the complete removal of every trace of these illegal plantations. To ensure transparency and accountability, impartial third-party observers should be appointed to oversee the operation. This measure will bolster public trust and safeguard the operation’s legality and ethical integrity. By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively, the Indian Army can not only dispel suspicions but also contribute significantly to the peace, security, and well-being of Manipur.(Dr Marc Nongmaithem is an informed/concerned citizen who loves to write on issues of public importance.

ominous-start-to-the-new-year-2024,"Between riots, internal armed conflicts, external influences, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, the State appears to be headed in a directionless pathway. The political will needs to be strengthened, the leadership needs to be tightened, and the State’s Vision Document needs to be refined and spelled out in actualityBy Salam RajeshFrom the experiences of the preceding year 2023 it was not expected that the year 2024 would go smoothly without hassles, and as was presumed things did not turn out well for the global community right from day one – the New Year Day itself – with the island nation of Japan being rocked by a massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake and California’s sea coast being swept furiously by massive sea surges – signs of nature’s fury.Manipur, too, was not far behind on the list of bad news around the world with Kuki militias springing an armed assault on Manipur Police commandos at the border town of Moreh right at the beginning of the New Year, and other locations, including Tumukhong and Kadangband, in a presumed planned statement on the continued armed aggression to signal their stated position over their demand for ‘separate administration’ outside of the State’s administrative jurisdiction, apparently.The beginning of the new calendar year for the State did not fare well with a straight-forward lockdown imposed on Tuesday, the second day of the new calendar year! A skirmish at Lilong town on the outskirts in the late evening of day one of the new calendar year left the population shocked and baffled by the outbreak of violence in the Greater Imphal limits affecting the Manipuri Muslim population residing in the town — for whatsoever reason.At the close of the preceding year, the State Government had imposed the shutdown of schools for around a week owing to the sudden spike of cold, lashed with icy cold wind sweeping down the central Manipur valley. Scientists at the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bengaluru had forecast that the year 2024 would be exceedingly warm owing to the sudden intervention of EL Nino around August last year.At this risk calculation, farmers in the State are cautioned to feel the impact of warmer summer season with a forecast of rainfall deficit, meaning the agricultural season this calendar year would be largely impacted by changing climatic conditions, which of course humans cannot alter. The rainfall deficit combined with ethnic riots last year had impacted crop production tremendously. Agricultural landowners received either less than half of the estimated produce or none at all in many places.Taking the calculated risk of the continuing ethnic violence, which Kuki militias are unrelentingly keeping up to meet their demand before parliamentary elections by May this year, the calendar year 2024 is not going to be smooth sailing for Manipur’s agrarian society. The impact on crop production will be equal to a corresponding rise in prices of rice, fish and vegetables that normally come from rural Manipur.More Stories like thisThreading Safety Pathways For Transboundary Migratory…Feb 21, 2024Invasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024Outlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Elsewhere around the world, Australia in the Southern Hemisphere is being hit by unprecedented summer heat and wildfires are sweeping across parts of the continent, a process that has been there for the past two years specifically, destroying homes and properties, and displacing the wildlife to a large extent.The risks of wars and internal armed conflicts, and the increasing precedence of extreme weather events are expected to create more havoc and misery for many around the world. The increased frequency of depressions and cyclonic storm formation in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea is likely to hit the North East more seriously with each passing year. The chaos from the onslaught of nature’s fury is likely to add confusion to the internal strife that is upsetting life for many in Manipur presently.Like in recent times when Manipur hit the headlines with the drug menace, read as accelerated illegal poppy cultivation and clandestine drug smuggling through the porous State’s international border with Myanmar, the calendar year 2024 is expected to see a continuation of the process, as much as the Lilong incident on date one earlier this week is loud and clear. If it is any consolation for the Manipur Government with its ‘War on Drugs’ campaign, Mizoram has temporarily taken over the clandestine networking of illegal drug trade with large seizures being reported almost daily without respite.The increasing divide between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots is apparent with the nature of richly enclaved homesteads and establishments springing up all over the state capital region. An increase in salaries through the sixth pay commission, with a looming further increase via the seventh pay commission, may perhaps be a reason, whereas, the fundamentally suspect on the illegal drug trade may not be out of the context to see homesteads prospering out of magnitude – given the per capita income status.On the other side of the story, the rate of environmental degradation especially in the mountainous tracts continues to be an eye sore and it perhaps needs the express attention of the State planners to define strategies to combat environmental degradation, in particular the watersheds, to check rivers drying up in the pre-and post-monsoon seasons, whereby this does impacts people’s livelihoods and affects agricultural activities to a large extent.Availability of water is an issue that plagues the State’s natives, more specifically the urban populations, and it is a process that is going to continue through the new calendar year 2024. Much of the water bodies are clogged with invasive weeds and many have been reclaimed for human activities, minimizing the resource use of the water bodies. Unless the State comes up with effective measures in this new calendar year, the issue will become all the more complex and will hurt livelihoods and the rural economy.The State’s proclaimed campaign on the eradication of unauthorized poppy cultivation – albeit the illegal drug trade – needs a larger and broad-based strategy in the new calendar year 2024, and beyond, to convince local people of the long-term negative impact of this pervasive human activity. The Mount Koubru is a classic example of the abstract abuse by humans on Nature, and this is quite evident in the decreasing environmental flow of the Manipur River.So, between riots, internal armed conflicts, external influences, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, the State appears to be headed in a directionless pathway. The political will needs to be strengthened, the leadership needs to be tightened, and the State’s Vision Document needs to be refined and spelled out in actuality."
chakhum-gi-meiri-mission-accomplished-100-relief-camps-get-lpg-facilities,"“The Chakhum-gi Meiri team” handed over six LPG stoves and gas cylinder refill charges to the relief camps at Akampat and Sawombung of Imphal EastTFM DeskChakhum-gi Meiri Mission of providing LPG facilities at all valley relief camps was completed on December 25, 2023 with the visit to Akampat and Sawombung relief camps of Imphal East. “With the handing over of LPG Heavy duty stoves and LPG initial refill charges to the 100th Relief Camp, our mission to distribute 200 LPG burners and cash support for 200 cylinder refills has been accomplished,” said a statement.“The Chakhum-gi Meiri team” handed over six LPG stoves and gas cylinder refill charges to the relief camp at Ideal Girls College, Akampat of Imphal East in the presence of Nodal Officer Imphal East, James Konsam. The relief camp, which is housing 886 internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the ongoing Kuki-Meitei conflict, is fully dependent on firewood for daily cooking needs. The team also visited Sawombung pre-fabricated facilities where one extra LPG stove was provided in the community Kitchen 1 and 3 respectively.It is estimated that about 20 to 30 truck-loads of firewood were used in a month in these 100 to 130 relief camp community kitchens. With the use of LPG gas for cooking, overall cooking time and cleaning time by inmates would be reduced significantly. Energy-efficient LPG gas will reduce the carbon footprint of the kitchen. With the LPG facilities, the inmates can prepare breakfast for school-going students, which otherwise individual family bears at additional cost and time, said the statement.Narrating the Journey of the “Meiri”, it said while visiting Oksongbung relief camp of Bishnupur district on September 30, 2023, a few volunteers felt the need for LPG facilities as large quantities of firewood were being used in these kitchens. Later it was followed by a group of like-minded people and implemented through Manipurtimes and Chakhum platform with the theme of “Chakhum-gi Meiri Mut-han-gumsi ” – The Flame of the Home & Hearth must remain alive.More Stories like thisUNLF condoles demise of Pvt MongoljaoFeb 5, 2024ASUK pays ‘revolutionary tribute’ to DhanaFeb 1, 2024ASUK announces ‘total shutdown’ on Republic DayJan 23, 2024With the information gathered from respective DC offices of Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur districts, 110 relief camps were initially identified without LPG facilities out of about 140 relief camps. A budget of Rs. six lakh and 200 burners were planned to fulfil this mission.A WhatsApp group was formed on October 10, 2023, and started inviting people through individual networking to join the mission. Social media platforms of Manipurtimes and Chakhum were effectively used for a larger reach and started campaigning on October 21, 2023.After the mission team was formed, the first relief camp visit was made on October 29, 2023 covering two relief camps of Moirang, Bishnupur district. Continuous efforts are made to get more funds for the mission and keep visiting more relief camps.While trying to reduce the cost, an order of 120 stoves was made through a firm at Kolkata. The challenges of the bulk transportation were supported by the Assam Rifle by air-lifting from Kolkata to Imphal, under special arrangement.With the passing days, many camps are found to be closed and merged with another and effectively. Few relief camps still prefer to use firewood for daily needs for cooking and hence LPG stoves were not provided to those specific camps.With the coverage of a total of 100 relief camps, the mission is declared completed as on December 25, 2023, said the statement."
ethnic-violence-in-manipur-is-product-if-strategic-collusion-between-kuki-militants-illegal-immigrants-and-drug-cartel,"Issued By Manipur Meitei Association, Bangalore (MMAB) & World Meetei Council (WMC)Various narratives from both ends explaining the trigger behind the most recent altercation between Meitei and Kuki are largely accusatory in nature. That said, it is important to look at the history and demography of Manipur in order to properly understand the long-running internal strife, the tribal communities’ vigorous resistance to Meitei demand for ST designation and the eruption of the ethnic violence currently taking place.Manipur is a state in the Northeast of India which was granted its statehood on the 21st of January 1972. Earlier, it was under Union Territory after passing the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganization) Act, 1971. It spans a total area of 22,327 square km and as per the 2011 Census (Manipur Population Census 2011, Manipur Religion, Literacy, Sex Ratio – Census India), the population of the state was estimated at 28.56 lakhs (roughly 2.87 million), whereas the distribution between Hindus and Christians, to be about 41% each. According to available source, the population of Manipur is currently 31.94 lakhs (roughly 3.2 million) as of 2022. There are 33 recognized tribes considered indigenous peoples of Manipur. To be more specific, many of these ethnic sub-tribal communities identify as either Kuki or Naga; in essence, there is no actual homogenous tribe community known as Kuki or Naga. Meiteis (mainly Hindu tribes) reside in the Imphal valley which accounts for approximately 9% of the total area while Christian tribes (mainly Kuki and Naga) reside in the Hill areas. There is no land protection for Meiteis of this meagre 9%of Manipur’s overall land mass, known as the Imphal valley, which is shared by a variety of different ethnic tribes, including Muslim, as well as other non-Manipuri communities like the Marwaris, Punjabi, Bengali etc.However, none of these groups, including the Meiteis, are permitted to live in Hill areas. Moreover, once a land has been purchased and owned by tribal members in the Valley area, repurchasing and reacquiring said land from a tribal communitymember is an exceedingly challenging and laborious endeavor as it is protected under a special Provision regarding Schedule Tribes. Bear in mind that these numerous disadvantages faced by indigenous Meiteis to own land in their native state–largely due to this inequitable bifurcation of hill-valley laws – come in spite of the entirety of the state of Manipur state being classified as a Hill state, much like Srinagar, a valley in Jammu and Kashmir. This is following the 1965 Planning Commission, where states in India are categorized as Hill States and States with Hill areas.The tribal communities who are protected by the constitution article 371 strongly oppose the Meitei receiving the ST status contending that they are already privileged elite Hindus, and may infringe on their rights to their share of the reservations and thus encroach their lands. Manipuri or Meitei Lon has historically been employed as a language of trade as the Meitei have traditionally controlled the Imphal valley, which served primarily as a hub for commerce and economic activity. As this is also the official language in Manipur, it seems to be a source of shared grievance among the tribal communities that there is a certain bias towards a single community – this argument needs to be reconsidered in those terms.On the other hand, the Meitei maintain that this demand for inclusion has nothing to do with other tribes as it has been a long-standing demand that, for decades, has fallen on deaf ears and largely ignored by all governments. For their part, the Meitei contend that because of their marginalization, being socially and economically underdeveloped, they are entitled to the constitutional protection of their rich culture and heritage which would otherwise be at risk of being lost and feel that requesting the ST status is not only justified but becoming increasingly urgent.The Imphal Valley population is very diverse and reflects its multicultural and multi-ethnic makeup. In recent years, the fervor of the ST demand has been reignited with the train set to connect Manipur to the rest of the country. The indigenous Meiteis, both those adhering to Hinduism and those following the ancient faith of Sanamahism have been safeguarding their culture and heritage, preserving sacred groves, and worshipping their native gods and goddesses for countless generations. Despite the adoption of Hinduism, Meitei Hindus have a long and steadfast tradition of performing indigenous Meiteirituals – every household has a designated corner for the “Lainingthou” (supreme God) and every locality possesses a sacred deity who watches over the sacred grove where yearly celebrations of the “Laiharaoba” take place in every neighborhood. Moreover, the majority of the tribal population is Christian, a religion introduced by European missionaries in the late 19th century.While they are also protecting their lands and traditions, much of it has been lost after the adoption of Christianity as the religion does not permit dual worship or the observance of non-Christian traditions. It is important to note that the granting of the ST status is a constitutional matter that requires a thorough examination of the socio-economic and cultural characteristics of the community. The decision to grant or reject the Meiteis’ demand for the ST designation ultimatelyrests with the Central government based on the recommendations of the committee.In order to postulate the possibility of a common resentment toward the Meitei from these communities, particularly the Kuki, it is important to understand their narratives. The Kuki population in Manipur is estimated at 4.7 lakhs as per the 2011 census and 9.26 lakhs according to open source. If we trace the history, the Kuki immigration to Manipur began during the colonial period when the British established the Chin Hills as a separate district in 1892. The Kukis, who were then living in the Chin Hills, were displaced and pushed towards Manipur, where they settled in the Churachandpur district. The Kukis also migrated to Manipur during the Second World War, when they were recruited by the British to fight against the Japanese. In recent years, the Kukis from Myanmar have been crossing the border illegally and settling in Manipur due to various socio-political and economic reasons. Because of the government of India’s absence on policies concerning refugee resettlement along with the close ethnic ties between Manipuri Kuki and Chin Kuki from Myanmar, they are able to cross over undetected and easily blend in. This is the primary concern of the government of Manipur and as such, have been in serious discussion to implement a National Register of Citizens (NRC), a register of Indian citizens in order to identify illegal immigrants.The NRC was first implemented in the state of Assam. Implementation of the NRC comes with many challenges including strong opposition, especially from the Kuki community, given their history and recent immigration. It should be noted that the NRC is a complex process that involves extensive documentation and verification, and its implementation requires significant resources and manpower.The population growth since 2001 is recorded at 24.5%, while the population of Meiteis has remained constant. The population of the Kuki in particular, has seen the most significant growth, subsequently changing the entire demographic of the state. In one study, it was found that over the decade, the Kuki-Chin population has increased by almost 230%, primarily due to the illegal immigration of Kuki-Chin into the territory. Local sources state that this growth is mainly found in five districts nearing Myanmar, namely, Churachandpur, Pherzawl, Chandel (bordering town of Moreh), Tengnoupal (enroute to Moreh) and Kangpokpi. These illegal Kuki immigrants, illegally settled in reserved forested lands, have been primarily involved in poppy plantation with the support of drug cartels and have long been demanding an Independent Kuki Homeland.For the most part, Meitei and Kuki have generally always coexisted peacefully as evidenced during the 1993 Kuki and Naga conflict, where the Meitei provided shelter and safe haven to thousands of Kuki. The matter in question concerns the illegal Kuki-Chin immigrants from Myanmar, who are involved in militancy, drugs and poppy cultivation.• The total Kuki population in Manipur as per 2011 census was 4,67,854. Recent estimates place the Kuki population at ~ 30% of the total Manipur population, which converts to ~ 9 lakhs.• Instead, if we project the Kuki population for 2022 using the 2021 Manipur birth rate of 13.3, thisyields ~ 5.4 lakh.• Even a conservative estimate shows an abnormal excess population of 2-3 lakhs. This abnormality can only be attributed to illegal immigration.Another point of contention is Poppy cultivation as a means of livelihood. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact areas of poppy cultivation in Manipur as most of it is taking place in remote and inaccessible areas, and much of it is being done illegally. However, according to the Narcotics Control Bureau, poppy cultivation in Manipur covers an estimated area of around 16,000 hectares, with the districts of Chandel, Ukhrul, and Churachandpur being the most affected.The government is fighting a war on drugs and the state police have been cracking down on poppy cultivation, with those caught being punished under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Eviction drives in the reserved forests in the wake of frequent forest fires and global climate change including droughts in Manipur have been adopted by the government after a long lapse of its own machinery. This sudden drive is predominantly affecting the forest dwellers, immigrants comprised of mostly Kukis who are strongly opposed, among other tribes or communities. The Kuki believe that it is not the prerogative of the Government and instead a tactic by the Meiteicommunity’s majority to claim their land.More Stories like thisYUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022YOONGOU LITRE 250 ROM PHAGATTUNA MANGHANKHRESep 4, 2022Another common point of discontent among the tribals is the hill-valley division in the legislature being dominated by Meitei as Chief Ministers excluding Yangmaso Shaiza and Reshang Keishing (12 yrs.). Currently, out of 60 MLAs, 40 serve the Imphal valley whereas just over 20 are reserved for tribals in the hills. However, since Manipur acquired its full statehood in 1972, this representation has been based purely on the size of the population. This needs to be reviewed in more detail which is why it is imperative to conduct the NRC. The valley has most facilities as it happens to be the capital and home to most ethnicities, thus the economic capital. This pattern of the capital always being wealthier and more affluent than the distant areas, together with significant gaps in both government efficiency and investment prospects, has persisted throughout history. Because of a markedly uneven and unbalanced division of policies between the hill and the valley, there is no consensus amongst government officials on how to deal with the reservation norms and merits of not only the Meiteis who are classified as general or OBC (Other Backward Classes), but of all ethnicities –entitlements such as ST or OBC are designations meant to uplift and provide aid to the underprivileged portions of society rather than lifelong entitlement badges to be taken advantage of which is a persisting issue. Due to a substantial lack of transparency regulating the public sphere, there is a systemic failure in the functioning of the government that consistently puts the dominant community in Imphal at a social and economic disadvantage time and again. The hill areas are administered at the district level by theAutonomous district council, empowered to maintain and manage property: movable and immovable, and institutions under their jurisdiction except reserved forests. At the state level, the Hill areas committee that includes the MLA of these areas, oversee the planning, implementation and monitoring of all development activities in these areas. If the Hill areas are a genuine casualty of underdevelopment, then the implementation of proper reforms and the amendment of inadequate policies should be reviewed in priority in order to bring more transparency and effective management within governing bodies and help connect with and efficiently serve the people from all areas, objectively, and without bias to any one group – irrespective of the hill-valley divide.A high-level committee led by the department of tribal affairs; Manipur earlier has recommended moving away from the hill-valley fund allocation system to a tribal sub-plan system. This is because the current system does not accurately capture the actual fund allocation and expenditure for the hill districts. Currently, a number of projects from the valley allocations benefithill areas or both, such as the Tribal Research Institute, Hill Village Chiefs Guest House, Manipur Secretariat, Inter-State Bus and Truck Terminus, among others. It is also worth mentioning here that the percentage of expenditure in hill areas has increased over the years, as reflected in the figures of 33.8% (2016-2017) and 45.75% (2020-21). The main flaws were delays and lack of precise census data for an extensive period as well as the hill-valley division of the budget.Some developments and significant initiatives taken by the current BJP Government in Manipur led by Chief Minister Shri N. Biren Singh1. Drug trafficking is a major transnational organized crime with the potential to undermine national security. India’s proximity to the Golden Triangle is being misused by criminals for their nefarious activities and the cases has been on rise over the period. The current government has been engaged in an aggressive anti-drug campaign and as such,dismantled many poppy plantations. This, in turn, significantly impacted the poppy and drug business supply chains of the notorious Golden Triangle route.

More recently, the Manipur High Court Order dated March 27, 2023 directing the Minister of Tribal Affairs, GoI (first respondent) to consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list –expeditiously, and preferably within a period of four weeks from the date of reception of a copy of the order in terms ofthe averments set out in the written petition and in line with the order passed in WP(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court– was a matter of contention.Although the above initiatives were in favor of furthering the state’s development, unfortunately, they came into conflict with the demand of an Independent Kuki Homeland by Kuki militants and illegal migrants as well as significantly impacted the poppy plantation business run by the drug cartels and illegal Kuki-chin immigrants. Multiple Kuki Organizations, Militant groups and affected drug cartels took this opportunity to instigate the Kuki population against the government andplanned for a retaliation which was further prompted by the emotional outcry following the encroachment drive at K Songjang village and the High Order on the Meteis ST demand.1. April 27: A Day before Biren Singh’s visit to Churachandpur, the open gym the chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate was set on fire.2. April 28: Section 144 was imposed along with a five-day suspension of internet services. Protesters and security forces clashed, with police resorting to the use of tear gas shells to disperse the mob in the district of Churachandpur.According to sources, police forces were not removed from the district despite the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF) agreeing to withdraw the protest. A mob gathered in the Tuibong Bazar area resorted to burning tires on the roads.3. May 3: Thousands turned up for the Tribal Solidarity March called by the All-Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) to protest against the inclusion of Meiteis in the ST category. The rally was held across all districts in Manipur and all were relatively peaceful except in Churachandpur. More than 60,000 people were estimated to have attended the rally in Churachandpur. Violence erupted during the rally in the Torbung area –a village towards Moirang– of Churachandpur. Simultaneous violence also broke out in Moreh, a town bordering Myanmar with a sizable Meitei population, where entire shops and houses of the latter community were burned.It appears that Kukis had been planning for it after some of the initiative taken up by Government well in advance, mobilizing resources and people. Thousands of participants were seen carrying sophisticated automatic weapons in full combat gear in the so-called “peace rally”.This leaves no doubt that this was a premediated, deliberate and well-planned act. The Kuki alleged that during the peace rally, Meitei vandals set fire to the Anglo Kuki War Centenary Gate, a monument with historical significance to the Kuki, and in retaliation the Kuki responded with arson, destruction of property and burning Meitei villages and settlements in Kukidominated areas.The Meitei reported that Kuki militants, illegal immigrants and Kuki wrongdoers set flame to many Meitei houses in Kuki dominated areas where people resorted to fleeing their homes amidst the destruction. An unfortunate casualty of these arson attacks was the death of a 2-year-old infant. Purportedly, a viral video regrettably triggered arson and vandalism in Meitei dominated areas. For the purpose of peaceful coexistence, the exact cause of this trigger begs a proper investigation with reliable figures and hard facts to get to the bottom of it.After news of these hostilities broke out, there was retaliation in Imphal valley in late evening leading to full-fledged communal violence in some areas. Reports of burning Kuki properties and their respective places of worship came in as well. In response, armed with sophisticated automatic weapons, Kuki militant and miscreant groups further attacked Meitei settlements in the Hill and Kuki dominated areas. To defend themselves, Meiteis reportedly armed themselves withclubs and sticks, some even gathering firearms from Police stations as they were left alone to protect their children and families. As Meitei’s and protesters (tribals) clashed on the streets, state security forces rushed to the scene and prohibitory orders were imposed in eight districts.Officials state the death toll in this rash of brutal ethnic violence currently engulfing Manipur has reached 66. Unofficial sources placed the figure at a much higher number in the neighborhood of 200 -250 dead and more than 150 injured. More than 70,000 families have been displaced. More than 1700 Meitei homes were ravaged by fire and displaced Meiteis were placed in Relief Camps with limited resources and no proper access to food or water. There are about 76 Relief campsset up for the displaced Meitei families and a further 10 Kuki relief camps in various parts of Manipur. Many places of worship from both communities were lost to vandalism. All Meitei Hindu places of worship in 5 districts dominated by Kuki, including the Hindu Lord Shiva temple at Koubru Leikha, Konthok Leirenbi temple at Moreh, Pakhangba Leishang, Ibudhou Thangjing Koirellai, Emorok Mahadeva mandir (Shiva Mandir) were also sabotaged by arson. All these places of worship are very sacred with significant historical background standing for millennium.In the deliberate arson attack, all Meitei home temples – situated in the courtyard, an equally sacred sanctuary worshipped in the home of every Meitei household and vital to the identity of all Meiteis– were destroyed. Some of Kuki Churches which was destroyed as per the report are New Checkon Church, Kuki Baptist Church, Zou Presbyterian Church. Two churches torched as fresh violence erupts in Manipur – Matters India. Please note there was also a demolition of three illegal construction of Churches by the Government prior the outbreak of communal Violence.As far as the Kuki are concerned, the impacted area being limited to the Imphal valley was more or less contained, however, no news has mentioned the delay in reaching the Meitei civilians who were greatly affected in the hill areas. While the media is covering the communal violence, the heart of the crisis lies in the foothills and Hill areas in the five Kuki-dominated districts of Manipur where there are remains of destroyed Meitei settlements. Security forces are finding extremelychallenging to conduct a proper recue to evacuate the people most affected as heavy firing by Kuki militants continues from all sides with no viable escape route for safe relocation. There are alarming reports of a certain militant group controlling the peripheral areas of Manipur and the Imphal valley, and said to be blocking national highways and stopping essential supplies from reaching Imphal. Unfortunately, not a single media organization is covering this pressing issue due to lack of access and communication. There are multiple narratives and all these need to be thoroughly investigated by an independent body to demystify the truth.On a positive note, amidst this communal clash, there are multiple reports of Kuki giving shelter to Meitei in the Hill areas as well as Meitei giving shelter to Kuki in the Valley area. Regardless of which side is right or wrong, not all are complicit in the violence. This is a message we can all learn from and need to spread in these dire times, of peace, compassion and humanity.From examining the sequence of events, one can conclude that the issue has nothing to do with religion or Hindus and Christians. The conflict is between two communities, Meitei and Kuki. In addition, certain Kuki Militants and Kuki-chin groups who have been significantly impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives and policies put forward by the Manipur Government set off this chain of premeditated attacks and instigated the innocent Kuki public into acts of vandalism andviolence. The Judgement passed by the Manipur High Court is a legitimate order that considers the legitimacy of the Meitei to be recognized for the ST status as per the Indian Constitution, and any disagreement would have to be taken to and challenged in a Higher Court or in the Supreme Court of India, as per the Law. No reason can justify attacks on civilians, the burning of villages nor the killing of innocent people. This conflict is not about religion or one group being more privileged than the other, it is about certain novel and more hostile elements of the Kuki diaspora – namely militant outsiders and illegal immigrants – wanting to keep benefitting from protective laws that do not apply to them in the first place, being non-native to Manipur. In short, this resulting crisis is the coalescence of Kuki militants and illegal Kuki-chin immigrants demanding an Independent Kuki Homeland compounded by the Kuki feeling threatened from being excludedand discounted from the narrative with emerging new laws.That being said, some critical questions need to be addressed and answered:1. Why permission was given for the massive “peace rally” arranged by the Kuki-chin while continuous violence was on going and why the Government removed Section 144 which was already enforce prior to the peace rally2. Under what circumstances the permission was given and why no adequate security arrangements were made and for the rally.3. Why the Manipur Commando team was withdrawn on May 2nd 2023, the day before the Rally.4. How the State Police failed us so thoroughly in this matter, and who is responsible for the loss of innocent lives.5. How were armed Kuki militants and miscreants permitted to carry sophisticated automatic weapons in the open public. Has Manipur fallen under Taliban rule? The most important matter the Government needs to resolve is the issue related to illegal Kuki immigrants and the rise of Kuki militants (KRA, ZRA, KNA) and any underground Organization. Law andOrder has to be established here. This should be the prime focus for the State and Central Government.The Government should take up firm and punishable legal measures against all the perpetrators in order to restore the people’s belief and trust in the laws of the land. The issue should beinvestigated by independent agencies like NIA/CBI directly under Retd. Supreme Court Judge. Thankfully, the Central Government has now intervened to protect Manipur from Internal and External aggression by Kuki Militant groups and illegal armed immigrants. Adequate central forces have arrived to curb the violence and restore Law and Order in the State of Manipur.(Written by Manipur Meitei Association, Bangalore (MMAB) & World Meetei Council (WMC)"

few heartbreaks including battling with oral cancer for many years which finally took his life on Monday morning at around 9 am at the AIIMS, New Delhi.Popularly known as the “Guru” amongst Hindi music aficionados from across the country and also a fitness enthusiast including having keen interest in martial arts, weight lifting, boxing, and other sporting activities, Chuba was also one of the pioneers in introducing body building in Nagaland following his parent’s footsteps.This multi-lingual artist having crooned in ten languages including his mother tongue (Ao), English, Hindi, Bengali,

entertaining his many fans since he started his musical journey and engaging in other philanthropic activities, in the year 2012, he was diagnosed with “mouth or oral cavity cancer” due to chewing of tobacco related items including “paan and ghutka” and by 2014, it led him into to the fourth stages where he had to be admitted to the AIIMS in New Delhi, and then Apollo, where his treatment began.A cancer survivor and a fitness enthusiast, who had taken up the challenges to face life with a positive note and who himself had visited many schools and colleges in the state to testify his experience

a-good-hearted-thai-ladys-journey-to-manipur,"Maynumpetch wishes the best for Manipur. She exhibits a rare sense of admiration for the Land of Jewels that would be the envy of many who are truly captivated by the variegated culture of the state.By Marjing MayanglambamI am truly honored to have known Maynumpetch. Just as Louise Lightfoot admired the beauty of Manipur’s art and culture, she was genuinely charmed by Manipuri dance as she pursued her bachelor’s degree in Thailand. Maynumpetch’s inspiration made her discover more about Manipur. She eventually discovered the uncanny resemblance and similarities of certain cultural traits between the people of Manipur and Thailand. As she became familiar with the connections, she wanted to visit Manipur. Owing to her utmost dedication, devotion, and love for the land of jewels, she finally reached Manipur in 2015.Maynumpetch graduated from Visva Bharati Santiniketan University in Drama and Theatre Arts. Who is Maynumpetch? Well, I am not the only person eager to know her, but as far as I know, she hails from Bangkok. She has a younger sister and many cousins who all grew up together in the beautiful land of Thailand. I may add that she is a very engaging and hard-working lady, and has lots of fans and acquaintances not only from Manipur but also from the Northeastern region of India.I also questioned myself about the mythological belief about the aromatic black rice, which we Manipuris believed came from Thailand. (Poireiton Chak-Hao) It could be a mere coincidence, historical occurrence, or folklore, but Manipur and Thailand have many cultural links, starting with art, culture, and food habits.Maynumpetch also got her motivation to travel from another compatriot. She developed the idea to make Vlogs even though she had no much knowledge about YouTube back then. She felt a lot like home whenever she came to Manipur because of the people, the food, and the environment. And thinks that Manipur is like her second home. There is this deep feeling inside her that deeply connects her with Manipur. She is always longing to visit this small mountainous land dotted with a unique single valley.More Stories like thisOutlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Alas!

Beyond Manipur, she has also visited various states of Northeast India, and her passion has burnt like a wildfire in India as a whole.Maynumpetch is a lovely person. And nobody would ever say or feel negative about her. My humble textual portrayal of Maynumpetch may sound like an elementary exaggeration, but these words are too little for such a priceless soul.I have not met her in real life, but I can say with pride that she is indeed a shining gem who cares for Manipur so genuinely as if she were born and raised amidst the misty hills and dales of this land.She always prays for peace and prosperity of Manipur and India. She cannot be who she is right now without the support of us in India. She has been expressing her gratitude to us and praying for peace, stability, and development to prevail in Manipur. Her videos on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are so wonderfully crafted that I even approached her for this short article one and a half years ago but could not publish it due to many reasons. However, this year, I believe that Maynumpetch’s peace and loving message will surely bring a change to Manipur and all of India.“Praying for everyone to stay happy and spread love.” – Maynumpetch(Marjing Mayanglambam is aPena Balladeer from Manipur, India)"
elections-or-festival-of-money,"The candidates and political parties having tons of black money (wonder where it is generated from) are distributing it freely in the form of cash, liquor or rations. Our gullible public is just making the most of it from all the candidates in their constituenciesBy Col Shireesh Bhatia (Retd)Having been closely involved for the first time in any kind of elections, I have been amazed and scared seeing the blatant use of money to buy votes during the Great Indian Election Festival. Despite all checks by expenditure monitoring teams put in place by the ECI, the candidates and political parties having tons of black money (wonder where it is generated from) are distributing it freely in the form of cash, liquor or rations. Our gullible public is just making the most of it from all the candidates in their constituencies.More Stories like thisMSACS ki warol laibak thibaniMar 8, 2023YUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022Recently, I met a friend of mine in Manipur who was cribbing about how the daily wagers working for the construction of his hospital have taken off for their respective villages or, in this case, their constituencies, leaving their work which is feeding their families. He explained to me that they are getting more money out of the intending candidates/ candidates in the electoral fray by going around their offices/ homes, so why would they want to work at this time.The ECI’s expenditure monitoring guidelines are good only if there’s no black money in play. Also, no candidate has been spending money beyond the limit laid down, simply because the period covered for the expenditure is from the date of nomination to the date of declaration of results, which is generally around a month only. More so, the actual expenditure is monitored from the nomination till the date of polling, which is just about 20 odd days, as in the current case of Manipur. However, the money being distributed by the candidates is not done in public places, so there’s no monitoring the same.Our public, despite being aware that the elected candidate shall first collect back all his or her expenditure before even thinking of using the Local Area Development Fund for the public. For a short term gain we are selling our votes. I came across a few people who said very unequivocally that they will vote for the candidate who gives them the highest amount. A candidate, no names, has gone around distributing cash to the tune of Rs 10000/- door to door (in the urban area) in the run up to the elections, starting nearly 6-8 months earlier. The capability of the candidate holds no meaning in our kind of democracy. Qualifications, background of political or social work or experience of public administration does not matter to our public. Hence, we get the kind of people that we see today as elected leaders, viz, contractors, uneducated and uncouth people. That actually sums up the elections in Manipur or for that matter, all over India, the elections have now become The Great Indian Election Festival or Festival of Money."

The bodies were also buried in a bomb shelter near the township hospital.

The saffron leader termed Bhimbar Deuri as a visionary personality who always raised voices for the benefit of indigenous people. Maintaining a strong stand against the infiltrators, Bhimbar Deuri played a vital role along with Assam’s first chief minister Gopinath Bordoloi in dismantling the conspiracy of British colonial forces to include the region in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the partition. Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi termed him as a Jananeta (people’s leader).Bhimbar Deuri (16 May 1903 – 30 November 1947) was also a successful lawyer, who logically fought against the British officers in accommodating due space for the tribals in general and common residents in general. One of the prime architects of Khasi Darbar Hall Resolutions (21–23 March 1945), where various ethnic leaders resolved for independence, Bhimbar Deuri also played a leading role in forming Assam Backward Plains Tribal League (1933). An undisputed leader among different tribes in Assam, Bhimbar Deuri insisted on sanctioning land pattas to indigenous Assamese families, primary education to every child and adequate political patronage to the deprived section in the society.A souvenir was also published on the occasion, where a number of articles highlighting different aspects of Bhimbar Deuri’s life & struggles were incorporated. Edited by award-winning writer Bipul Deuri, the souvenir reprinted some articles penned by veteran personalities like Nibaran Bora, Golap Borbora, Medini Choudhury, Indibar Deuri etc. It also comprises thought-provoking pieces by eminent author-scholars namely Hiren Gohain, Udayaditya Bharali, Anil Bharali, Paramanda Majumder, Mayur Bora along with Dilip Patgiri, Adip Kr Phukan, Ratneswar Deuri, Soranan Deuri, Nandeswar Deuri, Anup Kumar Deuri, Hem Ranjan Deuri, Subanti Deuri, Rupjyoti Konwar, Ratneswar Basumatary, Bhadreswar Deuri, Niroj Kr Raimedhi, Binu Deuri Barua, etc.In my speech as the assigned speaker, I emphasized on recognizing Bhimbar Deuri in all India level with a national award. Moreover, his contributions should get their due space in the history of India’s freedom movement. The educational institutions may consider academic research on his activities and an annual lecture will be an important tribute to the great social equalizer. At the same time, Assam should start debating over an upper house (Bhimbar Deuri was also a member of Assam Legislative Council in the pre-independence era), so that the tribals and underdeveloped communities with tiny populations can enjoy the political space they deserve."

manipur-needs-a-surgical-strike-to-eradicate-illegal-drugs-poppy-plantations,"By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively through the deployment of the Armed Forces, the government (and the Armed Forces) can not only dispel suspicions and distrust, but also contribute significantly to the lasting peace, security, and well-being of ManipurBy Dr. Marc NongmaithemManipur, a state nestled in the northeastern part of India, is grappling with a profound ethnic crisis that has been aggravated by the unlawful cultivation of poppy and cannabis in its hilly terrain. As the poppy harvest season approaches, it becomes crucial for Manipur’s residents to join hands with various stakeholders and call upon the Central Government and the Home Ministry to deploy the Armed Forces in eliminating these illicit plantations. This urgency stems from the fact that the illicit drug trade has significantly contributed to the ongoing crisis, perpetuating violence and instability in the region. It is imperative to emphasize the need for eradicating these unlawful plantations, addressing the plight of displaced individuals, and seeking a targeted solution to Manipur’s current crisis.Manipur’s natural beauty, specially the hills, have been marred by the illegal cultivation of poppy and cannabis. As the poppy harvest season approaches, there is growing concern that drug production and trafficking will intensify, exacerbating the already fragile situation. The proceeds from the drug trade have been the main source of funding for various insurgent groups, perpetuating conflict and instability in the region as we see today. The drug trade has attracted criminal elements, including drug cartels and armed groups, who have a vested interest in maintaining the current status quo.The ongoing crisis has resulted in the displacement of numerous individuals and families, turning them into Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). These displaced people are now living in precarious conditions, struggling to make ends meet and lacking a sense of purpose in life. The lack of government efforts for their rehabilitation and welfare is a pressing concern, and many IDPs are contemplating extreme measures, including suicide, due to the perceived apathy by the authorities. The number of IDPs in various relief camps is gradually increasing due to the continued and sporadic violence erupting from time to time. There is no clear plan from the government to help these IDPs return to their homes peacefully or to put an end to the violence once and for all. The status quo persists, and so does the violence and the rampant illegal cultivation of cannabis and poppies in the hills. In other words, the current measures and policy deployed in Manipur to restore peace is not working!More Stories like this2024 Census shows Loktak Waterbird Count lowest in DecadeFeb 24, 2024Manipur HC withdraws contentious portion in its March 2023…Feb 22, 2024Invasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024While the Armed Forces have established a buffer zone and maintained a semblance of peace in certain conflict-ridden areas of Manipur, it is clear that these measures are temporary and insufficient to bring about a lasting solution. Violence continues to erupt sporadically, and the root cause of the problem—illegal drug plantations—remains largely unaddressed.The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) gives the Indian Army broad powers to operate in designated “disturbed areas.” However, these powers are not unrestricted, and they seem to be subject to directives from the central government. In the hills of Manipur, illegal poppy plantations are thriving, apparently with the knowledge of the nearby Armed Forces deployments. The Armed Forces appear to be turning a blind eye to this, citing the need for specific orders from higher authorities before taking action. This is despite the fact that the Armed Forces has been busting drug transporters within the state and beyond. However, they have hardly busted any illegal cannabis and poppy plantations. Similarly, CM Biren’s War on Drugs initiatives have been busting transporters and growers of poppy and poppy products, but there have been no cases of illegal cannabis plantations being destroyed. These inconsistencies raise questions about the government’s true commitment to resolve the ongoing ethnic crisis in Manipur.The people of Manipur, along with various stakeholders, must unite and demand that the Central Government and the Home Ministry take decisive action against illegal drug plantations. The urgency of this call is underscored by the impending poppy harvest season, which threatens to further exacerbate the drug problem and the associated violence in Manipur. A “surgical strike” on these illegal drug plantations would be the most effective way to deal with the current problem. This would involve a coordinated effort by the Central Government and Armed Forces to destroy the plantations and arrest the perpetrators. The crisis in Manipur, fueled by illegal poppy and cannabis plantations, has persisted for far too long. It is imperative that the Central Government and the Home Ministry listen to the unified voice of Manipur’s residents and take decisive action to destroy these illegal plantations. If the Central Government fails to take swift action, it will be seen as condoning the drug mafia and its activities.Therefore, the Central Government must come up without fail, with a precise and effective “surgical” approach to tackle the root cause of the present ethnic crisis in Manipur. Eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis plantations by deploying the Armed Forces is “the crucial step” that is missing or being ignored by the Central Government. This would certainly break the backbone of the present narco-terrorism and would significantly undermine the financial resources of armed groups and criminal networks in Manipur. By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively through the deployment of the Armed Forces, the government (and the Armed Forces) can not only dispel suspicions and distrust, but also contribute significantly to the lasting peace, security, and well-being of Manipur.(Dr Marc Nongmaithem is an informed/concerned citizen who loves to write on issues of public importance.

framing-a-concretized-policy-for-indigenous-peoples-globally,"In Manipur, as in most regions where Indigenous peoples’ lands have been largely affected by extractive industries and other exploitative ventures by States and their agencies, the principle of FPIC has hardly been followed or respected, partially or wholly.By Salam RajeshIssues on discrimination over State policies on resources exploitation from traditional lands of Indigenous peoples around the world has been one of the most pervasive issues globally, often resulting in intense forms of conflicts of interest between local people and State agencies including investors and resource extractors.The issue has been in focus at the United Nations platform in these past several years with Indigenous peoples’ representatives from around the globe lobbying hard for a universal policy that respects the fundamental rights of all marginalized sections of people particularly clubbed under the nomenclature ‘Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs)’.The issue is to figure prominently during the Ad Hoc Open-ended Intersessional Working Group on Article 8(j) and the Related Provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity at the twelfth meeting of the Working Group under the broad umbrella of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at Geneva during the 12th to 16th of next month.The meeting’s thematic agenda “Development of a new program of work and institutional arrangements on Article 8(j) and other provisions of the Convention related to indigenous peoples and local communities” is crucial for the IPLCs in the face of strong objections from various State lobbies who could be evidently impacted by such a global decision aimed at protecting the traditional land holding system and the fundamental rights of the IPLCs.Section 4 of the work plan seeks to ‘EncourageParties (to the Convention) to engage with indigenous peoples and local communities as on-the-ground partners in the implementation of the Convention, including by recognizing, supporting and valuing their collective actions and respecting their indigenous and traditional territories and their efforts in applying, preserving and maintaining their traditional knowledge, innovation and practices in relation to promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity’.At the same time, Section 5 of the proposed work plan seeks to ‘UrgeParties (to the Convention) to fully involve indigenous peoples and local communities in the preparation of national reports and in the revision, update and implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans aligned with the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’.Section 6 of the proposed work plan of the CBD specifically stresses that the ‘Traditional knowledge, innovations, practices and technology held by Indigenous peoples and local communities should only be used with the Free, Prior and Informed Consent of Indigenous peoples and local communities’.It further stressed that ‘The use of traditional knowledge should be subject to the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use and application of such knowledge, innovations and practice based on mutually agreed terms in accordance with domestic law and with due consideration of the customary laws, community protocols and procedures of Indigenous peoples and local communities’.The focus of the work plan is ‘to promote, within the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity and in alignment with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the implementation of Article 8(j) and other provisions of the Convention at the local, national, regional and international levels and to ensure the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities at all stages and levels of its implementation’.More Stories like thisThreading Safety Pathways For Transboundary Migratory…Feb 21, 2024Invasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024Outlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Reflecting upon this concern of the IPLCs on the issue, the international organization Cultural Survival in its recent report “Securing Indigenous Peoples’ Right to Self-determination: A Guide On Free, Prior and Informed Consent (2023)” stressed that ‘the full and effective participation of Indigenous peoples and local communities, in particular Indigenous women, girls and young people, should be ensured, from the local to the global level, in all stages of the identification, implementation and monitoring of the elements of the program of work’.The emphasis stressed is on the principle of FPIC (Free, Prior and Informed Consent) and for the States and their agencies to respect human values. Cultural Survival emphasizes that FPIC “ensures Indigenous Peoples’ right to give or withhold consent to any activities that affect their lands, resources, and territories”.The right to FPIC flows from the Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination. It encompasses and protects all rights of Indigenous Peoples, including land rights, collective rights, participatory rights, cultural rights, food and water security rights.The principles of FPIC form a framework that informs the protocols, processes, rules, and regulations that Indigenous Peoples can require from companies, governments, and other sovereign nations when designing investments and infrastructure projects on Indigenous lands.In Manipur, as in most regions where Indigenous peoples’ lands have been largely affected by extractive industries and other exploitative ventures by States and their agencies, the principle of FPIC has hardly been followed or respected, partially or wholly.In the year 2007 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted theUnited Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples(UNDRIP) wherein the declaration recognized the Indigenous peoples’ individual and collective rights and making specific mention of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as a prerequisite for any activity that affects Indigenous communities.Similarly, during 2018 the United Nations’ Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples identified ‘respect for FPIC protocols as central to the conduct of good faith consultations’. This assertion comes from the argument that in most cases ‘investors and government officials would carry out “a consultation” as an opportunity to merely inform a community that an investment or development project will be happening’.Cultural Survival argues that ‘Investors may arrive for the first time accompanied by government officials who tell the community that “they are being consulted” and demand an immediate “yes”. In such situation, project developers do not allow time for an Indigenous community to discuss the potential project internally, seek independent advice, gather information, and then make a decision, privately and according to self-determined practices’.The assertion reflects very closely to the current endeavour of the State to go for the controversial oil palm cultivation in different parts of the State without going through a proper process of FPIC in the very first place.The concern is also on whether proper Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) are conducted or not. ESIAs predict the environmental and social consequences of a future project. Many countries have laws requiring that potential investors undertake impact assessments.Impact assessments are carried out by technical experts who assess the likely impacts of a proposed project and subsequently offer recommendations on how to avoid or reduce any negative impacts on the local environment – including air, water, and soil quality – and on the health and overall well-being of the to-be-impacted local community.Manipur Government and its concerned State agencies hopefully will adhere to the principles outlined in the proposed work plan of the CBD in all matters related to schemes and projects that could impact negatively on the natural landscapes and other biodiversity sensitive pockets of the State, including forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems."

Shin (50) was arrested by the Burmese soldiers from a bus terminal in Yangon on 15 October as she was shooting videos by a drone.More Stories like thisPEC expresses concern over arrest of Burmese journalistsDec 15, 2023Record number of journalists killed in Gaza within 2 monthsDec 9, 2023Meitei Diaspora in Europe with IPSA VP Stages…Sep 30, 2023Once worked as a video journalist for Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), Shin covered various socio-political issues affecting the southeast Asian nation. Later she developed herself as a brave documentary filmmaker and many of her productions were honoured in international events. Her work titled Now I’m 13, which narrates the struggle of an illiterate but intelligent young girl in central rural Myanmar endeavouring for education, received appreciation from the art connoisseurs. Her husband alleged that she has been repeatedly tortured during interrogation by the junta forces.“It’s shocking that the military rulers have imprisoned a lady journalist-filmmaker with the allegation of abetting terrorism in the troubled country, which is undergoing a almost civil war since the junta orchestrated a coup on 1 February 2021 dethroning a democratically elected government under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung Sah Suu Kyi. The junta (identified themselves as Military Council) must unconditionally release Shin Daewe along with other detained and imprisoned journalists,” said Blaise Lempen, president of PEC.Days back, the Independent Press Council Myanmar (IPCM) also denounced the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of journalists by the junta in the last three months. It confirmed that 52 journalists remain unjustly incarcerated by the military council till date. The IPCM asserted its commitment to expediting the release of detained journalists promptly and also safeguarding the rights of media outlets to express their news & views freely. The council also decided to collaborate with other organizations dedicated to the safety of media workers, exerting every possible effort to secure the freedom of journalists, and prevent the recurrence of such arrests.PEC’s south & southeast Asia representative Nava Thakuria informed that since the last military coup, the junta forces arrested over 170 journalists and only 118 have been released. The poverty-stricken country of around 55 million population has already lost four journalists namely Pu Tuidim (founder of Khonumthung news agency), Sai Win Aung (editor of  Federal News Journal) along with  Soe Naing and Aye Kaw (both were freelance photojournalists) to junta atrocities since the coup day on different occasions."
the-government-and-the-emperors-new-clothes,"It is the duty of the media, be it digital, print or electronic to criticize and to critique the system not for any political ends but for the larger interest of the publicBy Paojel Chaoba, Executive Editor, The Frontier ManipurThere have been much polemics over the subtle distinction between ‘to critique and to criticise’. However, the fallout of contemporary politics has both the words tainted with negative connotations like many more outdated and value-neutral words and phrases. Despite the existing twists to popular semantics, those of us from the world of journalism and media had since long been fed with the belief and value that ‘to critique and to criticise is our responsibility and for some perhaps, the job of showering praises and flattering political regimes.Yes! Within the constitutional democracy, we enjoy, it is not only the job of the journalist to critique and to criticise. Each citizen has a duty to perform and can express his or her views freely based on the call of the conscience. This voice from within may instigate us one and all to raise our voices while “the other conscience” influenced by fear and greed may tell you to keep silent and be perhaps make one comfortable with statist views that are contrary of democratic values.Maybe times are bad! The system may seek to convince or confuse and more or less seek to pound one down to submission. It has become a norm to crack the whip on those whose dissenting voices are clearly against any repressive power. Willy-nilly, many have been murmuring that the times are bad. However, the songs of the bad times will be sung aloud and not murmured anymore.One can imagine the predicament and moral issues faced by Galileo Galilei, the scientist who argued that the earth revolves around the sun. His argument was against the Church’s belief on geocentrism – the belief that the earth is fixed at the centre of the universe. Today, we know who was speaking what and what the challenge was. However, our current understanding and acceptance of the conceptual difference between – geocentrism and heliocentrism will be inconsequential to the powers that be of the ages gone by under which Galileo was persecuted. And hence, Galileo was a heretic for challenging the belief of the Church. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and died but he died with his belief in verifiable observation or his own truth.More Stories like thisRole of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023Manipur Chief Minister Calls for an End to India-Myanmar…Sep 25, 2023Amidst the tumultuous times, we can observe the power of any repressive systems and the ways they act and manoeuvre to win the trust of the public or to confuse all at best. Many are punished for lifting a finger with no chances of getting relief. The executive and the judicial systems are at times seemingly left to twist and dance to the whims of those in power while the common man or a simple peasant is left in the lurch or a vast desert with promises of a bountiful crop. Many continue to shovel and water the ground even as the futility of the exercise cannot be questioned as the proverbial sword of Damocles over their heads. However, those who have endured the labour and pains feel the hunger pangs and the primal need to satiate oneself oscillating between the idea of the citizen and a mere subject of the state. The questioning will have to be raised sooner or later.Presently, we can see those who have raised dissenting voices are being punished. Their arms twisted, some are at times offered sweets and are left to enjoy in private – their voices lost as they salivate and lick the jaggery syrup of the materialistic world. Many intellectuals and those who are known to raise questions are left in a whirlpool of self-doubt. They ask themselves if the effort is worth landing up in the bad books of the regime and take the risk. Many are forced to confine themselves in their comfort zones and cocoons.  It is understandable that those employed by the system would rather tow its line. This does not mean, there are no mavericks around even within the system. They do have eyes to make a distinction between black and white or the proverbial slave-master relationships. There are others who are willing to bare their backs willingly and wait for the whip. History bears witness to Socrates being made to consume hemlock by the Athenians for the allegation of corrupting young minds.Even as widespread oppression seems prevalent and the cheap rhetoric of jokers holds much water, the voices of faceless individuals in their master’s not-so-secret service literally infest the social media, barking at every comment which disagrees with the master’s voice. One can easily conjure up the image of a dog sitting near a gramophone on the once very popular logo of “HMV” or “His Master’s Voice”.It is the duty of the media, be it digital, print or electronic to criticize and to critique the system not for any political ends but for the larger interest of the public and to provide a redressal platform that is prevalent. To remain a silent spectator or to illogically ornate the populist programmes of the government is not a healthy practice. Those in power should learn to acknowledge when the public smells the stink. The dispensation should find out from where it is emanating from, to address the cesspool policies if there is any, instead of lashing out with orchestrated forces and emotive blindness.One is reminded of the literary folktale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen titled “The Emperor’s New Clothes”. The tale revolves around the story of how weavers of a vain king swindle him by giving beautiful ‘invisible clothes’ to appease his ego. The vain king parades around his kingdom in the nude.The public out of fear and reprisal applauds the king and his new outfit, afraid to say that the king is making a fool out of himself. Finally, a young boy points out to the king that he is not wearing any clothes. Similarly, the onus to tread on the lines of the young boy falls on those who dare and also know that we, the citizens have the freedom to express their views without fear while maintaining ethical values."
when-climate-debates-knock-on-the-door,"Himalayan landscape is witnessing no snow this winter. No snow meant no tourists, and no tourists meant dream shattered for many expecting tourist footfalls for their tourism businesses — hotel bookings, hot chais, hot chapatis — all gone with the wind.By Salam RajeshTourists planning for their winter holidays in the mountain landscape of Himachal Pradesh were rudely shaken by a mysterious hand of God — no snow! The snow-laden white mountainscapes of the Himalayan State, like Lahual-Spiti, have always drawn hundreds of skiers and snow-revellers every year, but December-end 2023 and beginning of January 2024 disappointed many. There were only brown capes and no white capes!Newspapers covering this phenomenal process in the Himalayan landscape juggled between two important aspects — the real-time impact of climate change and the hard-hit impact on businesses. No snow meant no tourists, and no tourists meant dream shattered for many expecting tourist footfalls for their tourism businesses — hotel bookings, hotchais,hotchapatis— all gone with the wind.The Himachal experience is interesting from many aspects, of which the significant ones are the rapid process in which climate change discussions are arriving at our doorsteps and the manner in which apparent climate change process is directly impacting people’s lives beyond what the average population expected or read about in newspapers. For many, the climate discourse would be those happening in far-away Arctic Circle and never for once imagining it is knocking at the door.The year 2023 was recorded as the hottest year in a century, with August-September months recording maximum temperatures in these past many decades, and it is expected that the year 2024 will further breach the record. El Nino entered the region’s scene midway last year and for the layman it would be hard to relate how this weather process may have likely impacted the Himachal experience.On another aspect, winter pollution level in neighbouring regions could also be lending a hand in affecting changes in the regional micro climatic regime. For instance, according to climate watch group Climate Trends, last year the national capital region of Delhi experienced a surge in winter pollution being attributed to factors like meteorological conditions and increased emissions. In neighboring Chandigarh, the pollution levels for January, February, and August to November in 2023 showed increase in winter pollution level. And, least to say, Lucknow’s pollution levels in August and September last year fell below the Indian standard of 40 mg/m3.More Stories like thisThreading Safety Pathways For Transboundary Migratory…Feb 21, 2024Invasive Alien Species In Larger Climate Change DiscourseFeb 14, 2024Outlining Ambitious National Target For Ecosystem…Feb 7, 2024Pollution and greenhouse gas emission on a larger scale are part of the game changers in affecting reasonable changes in local climatic regimes, added with the spice of global level climate change processes. The world at large is currently busy with so many discussions on how the world is headed to a collision with a possible 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperature by the year 2050, meaning the intensity of summer temperature is likely to surpass the 50 degree Celsius mark. At this measure, many countries will be boiling and mountainscapes are going to be brown instead of white in winter.And so, the climate debates at Aichi, Kyoto, Paris, Montreal, Berlin, Geneva, and many other cities around the world has apparently arrived at our doorsteps in earnest, which interestingly is reflected in the current scenario where the Himalayan state of Himachal is losing its snow in winter, as unimaginable as it can be!At Dubai’s COP28 meet on climate finance last year, the heads of the Adaptation Fund, the Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund together made a joint declaration announcing their climate ambitions.The declaration stated that ‘the need for collective, urgent, and ambitious action on climate is greater than ever before. As the results of the first global stocktake make clear, the world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. While progress is seen in some areas, much more is needed to reach net zero and adapt to climate impacts. A rigorous “all of economy, all of society” approach is needed across all systems and sectors’.On this end, the four entities pledged to work collectively to ‘enhance access to climate finance by working together across the areas of our activities’. In brief, they pledge to:We will seek to increase collaboration within our capacity – building support, recognizing that developing countries need the capacity to turn climate plans into projects, and to move from ambition to action.We will aim to develop greater synergies within our programming and between our theories of change, and to scale up projects. The MCFs (multilateral climate funds) have a number of collaborative programming initiatives which are already realizing strong results. We will develop this work and further explore the potential for joint programming initiatives that could allow us to deploy our collective resources at a larger scale and with greater efficiency.We will ramp up our collaborative work on monitoring, evaluation, and learning, including through the development of common indicators, alignment of our results frameworks, and the development of a common database for climate projects taking into account innovative tools.We will move towards harmonization of our procedures and processes, recognizing that complex application procedures, which are different for each fund, can be a significant barrier to accessing to climate finance.This is the level of urgency in global climate finance debates seeking collateral activities aimed at speeding up the execution of multilateral work programs to meet climate goals within the stipulated time frame, which is roughly between the years 2030 and 2050 as discussed in several forums under the United Nations system.In an emotional outburst, the UN secretary general Antonio Gueterres recently had called out to world leaders that the world is headed for climate catastrophe if countries are not willing to pool in their resources to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets well in time. In fact, several countries are currently experiencing the climate heat with phenomenal wildfires, floods, droughts, sea level rise, cyclonic storms, cloudbursts, glacial retreats, and many other processes, of which perhaps Himachal going snowless this winter could be hard evidence."
