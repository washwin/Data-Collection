"Russia(Russian:Россия,romanized:Rossiya,[rɐˈsʲijə]), or theRussian Federation,[b]is a country spanningEastern EuropeandNorth Asia. It is thelargest country in the world by area, extending acrosseleven time zones. It sharesland boundaries with fourteen countries.[c]It is theworld's ninth-most populous countryandEurope's most populous country. The country's capital as well as itslargest cityisMoscow.Saint Petersburgis Russia's second-largest city and cultural capital. Other major urban areas in the country includeNovosibirsk,Yekaterinburg,Nizhny Novgorod,Chelyabinsk,Krasnoyarsk,Kazan,KrasnodarandRostov-on-Don."
"TheEast Slavsemerged as a recognised group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. The first East Slavic state,Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, it adoptedOrthodox Christianityfrom theByzantine Empire. Rus' ultimately disintegrated, with theGrand Duchy of Moscowgrowing to become theTsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts ofRussian explorers, developing into theRussian Empire, which remains thethird-largest empire in history. However, with theRussian Revolutionin 1917, Russia's monarchic rulewas abolishedand eventually replaced by theRussian SFSR—the world's first constitutionallysocialist state. Following theRussian Civil War, the Russian SFSR established theSoviet Unionwith three otherSoviet republics, within which it was the largest and principal constituent. At theexpense of millions of lives, the Soviet Union underwentrapid industrialisation in the 1930sand later played a decisive role for theAllies in World War IIby leading large-scale efforts on theEastern Front. With the onset of theCold War, it competed with theUnited Statesfor global ideological influence. The Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of themost significant Russian technological achievements, including thefirst human-made satelliteand thefirst human expedition into outer space."
"In 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from thedissolution of the Soviet Unionas the independent Russian Federation. A newconstitutionwas adopted, which established afederalsemi-presidential system. Since the turn of the century, Russia's political system has been dominated byVladimir Putin, under whom the country has experienceddemocratic backslidingand a shift towardsauthoritarianism.Russia has been militarily involvedin a number ofconflicts in former Soviet states and other countries, including itswar with Georgiain 2008 andannexation of Crimeain 2014 from neighbouringUkraine, followed by the further annexation offour other regionsin 2022 duringan ongoing invasion."
"Internationally, Russiaranks among the lowestin measurements ofdemocracy,human rightsandfreedom of the press; the country also hashigh levels of perceived corruption. TheRussian economyranks11th by nominalGDP, relying heavily on its abundant natural resources, and 68th by GDP per capita. Its mineral and energy sources are the world's largest, and its figures foroil productionandnatural gas productionrank highly globally. Russia possesses thelargest stockpile of nuclear weaponsand has thethird-highest military expenditure. The country is apermanent member of the United Nations Security Council; a member state of theG20,SCO,BRICS,APEC,OSCE, andWTO; and the leading member state of post-Soviet organisations such asCIS,CSTO, andEAEU/EEU. Russia is home to30 UNESCO World Heritage Sites."
"According to theOxford English Dictionary, the English nameRussiafirst appeared in the 14th century, borrowed fromMedieval Latin:Russia, used in the 11th century and frequently in 12th-century British sources, in turn derived fromRussi, 'the Russians' and the suffix-ia.[22][23]In modern historiography, this state is usually denoted asKievan Rus'after its capital city.[24]Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' wasRuthenia.[25]"
"In Russian, the current name of the country,Россия(Rossiya), comes from theByzantine Greekname for Rus',Ρωσία(Rosía).[26]A new form of the nameRus',Росия(Rosiya), was borrowed from the Greek term and first attested in 1387.[27][failed verification]The nameRossiiaappeared in Russian sources in the late 15th century, but until the end of the 17th century the country was more often referred to by its inhabitants as Rus', the Russian land (Russkaia zemlia), or the Muscovite state (Moskovskoe gosudarstvo), among other variations.[28][29][30]In 1721, Peter the Great changed the name of the state fromTsardom of Russia(Russian:Русское царство,romanized:Russkoye tsarstvo) or Tsardom of Muscovy (Russian:Московское царство,romanized:Moskovskoye tsarstvo)[31][32]toRussian Empire(Rossiiskaia imperiia).[28][30]"
"There are several words in Russian which translate to ""Russians"" in English. The noun and adjectiveрусский,russkiyrefers to ethnicRussians. The adjectiveроссийский,rossiiskiydenotesRussian citizensregardless of ethnicity. The same applies to the more recently coined nounроссиянин,rossiianyn, ""Russian"" in the sense of citizen of the Russian state.[29][33]"
"According to thePrimary Chronicle, the word Rus' is derived from theRus' people, who were aSwedishtribe, and where the three original members of theRurikiddynasty came from.[34]TheFinnishword for Swedes,ruotsi, has the same origin.[35]Later archeological studies mostly confirmed this theory.[36][better source needed]"
"The first human settlement on Russia dates back to theOldowanperiod in the earlyLower Paleolithic. About 2 million years ago, representatives ofHomo erectusmigrated to theTaman Peninsulain southern Russia.[37]Flinttools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in theNorth Caucasus.[38]Radiocarbon datedspecimens fromDenisova Cavein theAltai Mountainsestimate the oldestDenisovanspecimen lived 195–122,700 years ago.[39]Fossils ofDenny, anarchaic humanhybrid that was halfNeanderthaland half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave.[40]Russia was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found inMezmaiskaya cave.[41]"
"The first trace of anearly modern humanin Russia dates back to 45,000 years, inWestern Siberia.[42]The discovery of high concentration cultural remains ofanatomically modern humans, from at least 40,000 years ago, was found atKostyonki–Borshchyovo,[43]and atSungir, dating back to 34,600 years ago—both inwestern Russia.[44]Humans reachedArctic Russiaat least 40,000 years ago, inMamontovaya Kurya.[45]Ancient North Eurasianpopulations from Siberia genetically similar toMal'ta–Buret' cultureandAfontova Gorawere an important genetic contributor toAncient Native AmericansandEastern Hunter-Gatherers.[46]"
"TheKurgan hypothesisplaces the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia andUkraineas theurheimatof theProto-Indo-Europeans.[48]EarlyIndo-European migrationsfrom thePontic–Caspian steppeof Ukraine and Russia spreadYamnayaancestry andIndo-European languagesacross large parts of Eurasia.[49][50]Nomadic pastoralismdeveloped in the Pontic–Caspian steppe beginning in theChalcolithic.[51]Remnants of these steppe civilizations were discovered in places such asIpatovo,[51]Sintashta,[52]Arkaim,[53]andPazyryk,[54]which bear the earliest known traces ofhorses in warfare.[52]The genetic makeup of speakers of theUraliclanguage family in northern Europe was shaped by migration fromSiberiathat began at least 3,500 years ago.[55]"
"In the 3rd to 4th centuries CE, theGothickingdom ofOiumexisted in southern Russia, which was later overrun byHuns. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries CE, theBosporan Kingdom, which was a Hellenisticpolitythat succeeded the Greek colonies,[56]was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the Huns andEurasian Avars.[57]TheKhazars, who were ofTurkic origin, ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century.[58]After them came thePechenegswho created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by theCumansand theKipchaks.[59]"
"The ancestors ofRussiansare among theSlavic tribesthat separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europec.1500years ago.[60]The East Slavs gradually settled western Russia (approximately between modernMoscowandSaint-Petersburg) in two waves: one moving fromKievtowards present-daySuzdalandMuromand another fromPolotsktowardsNovgorodandRostov.[61]Prior to Slavic migration, that territory was populated byFinno-Ugrianpeoples. From the 7th century onwards, the incoming East Slavs slowly assimilated the native Finno-Ugrians.[62][63]"
"The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival ofVarangians, theVikingswho ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Balticto the BlackandCaspianSeas. According to thePrimary Chronicle, a Varangian from theRus' people, namedRurik, was elected ruler ofNovgorodin 862. In 882, his successorOlegventured south and conqueredKiev, which had been previously paying tribute to theKhazars.[62]Rurik's sonIgorand Igor's sonSviatoslavsubsequently subdued all localEast Slavictribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate,[64]and launched several military expeditions toByzantiumandPersia.[65][66]"
"In the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns ofVladimir the Great(980–1015) and his sonYaroslav the Wise(1019–1054) constitute theGolden Ageof Kiev, which sawthe acceptance ofOrthodox Christianity fromByzantium, and the creation of the first East Slavic writtenlegal code, theRusskaya Pravda.[62]The age offeudalismand decentralisation had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of theRurik dynastythat ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit ofVladimir-Suzdalin the north-east, theNovgorod Republicin the north, andGalicia-Volhyniain the south-west.[62]By the 12th century, Kiev lost its pre-eminence and Kievan Rus' had fragmented into different principalities.[67]PrinceAndrey Bogolyubskysacked Kiev in 1169 and madeVladimirhis base,[67]leading to political power being shifted to the north-east.[62]"
"Led by PrinceAlexander Nevsky, Novgorodians repelled the invadingSwedesin theBattle of the Nevain 1240,[68]as well as theGermanic crusadersin theBattle on the Icein 1242.[69]"
"Kievan Rus' finally fell to theMongol invasionof 1237–1240, which resulted in thesacking of Kievand other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population.[62]The invaders, later known asTatars, formed the state of theGolden Horde, which ruled over Russia for the next two centuries.[70]Only the Novgorod Republic escaped foreign occupation after it agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols.[62]Galicia-Volhynia would later be absorbed byLithuaniaandPoland, while the Novgorod Republic continued to prosper in the north. In the northeast, the Byzantine-Slavic traditions of Kievan Rus' were adapted to form the Russian autocratic state.[62]"
"The destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of theGrand Duchy of Moscow, initially a part ofVladimir-Suzdal.[71]: 11–20While still under the domain of theMongol-Tatarsand with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century,[72]gradually becoming the leading force in the ""gathering of the Russian lands"".[73]When the seat of the Metropolitan of theRussian Orthodox Churchmoved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased.[74]Moscow's last rival, theNovgorod Republic, prospered as the chieffur tradecentre and the easternmost port of theHanseatic League.[75]"
"Led by PrinceDmitry Donskoyof Moscow, the united army of Russian principalities inflicteda milestone defeaton the Mongol-Tatars in theBattle of Kulikovoin 1380.[62]Moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such asTverandNovgorod.[73]"
"Ivan III(""the Great"") threw off the control of theGolden Hordeand consolidated the whole of northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion, and was the first Russian ruler to take the title ""Grand Duke of all Rus'"". After thefall of Constantinoplein 1453, Moscowclaimed succession to the legacyof theEastern Roman Empire. Ivan III marriedSophia Palaiologina, the niece of the lastByzantine emperorConstantine XI, and made the Byzantinedouble-headed eaglehis own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms.[73]Vasili IIIunited all of Russia by annexing the last few independentRussian statesin the early 16th century.[76]"
"In development of theThird Romeideas, the grand dukeIvan IV(""the Terrible"") was officially crowned the firsttsarof Russia in 1547. The tsarpromulgateda new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (theZemsky Sobor), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government.[73]During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates:KazanandAstrakhanalong theVolga,[77]and theKhanate of Sibirin southwestern Siberia. Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century, Russia expanded east of theUral Mountains.[78]However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessfulLivonian Waragainst the coalition of theKingdom of Polandand theGrand Duchy of Lithuania(later the unitedPolish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), theKingdom of Sweden, andDenmark–Norwayfor access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.[79]In 1572, an invading army ofCrimean Tatarswerethoroughly defeatedin the crucialBattle of Molodi.[80]"
"The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancientRurik dynastyin 1598, and in combination with the disastrousfamine of 1601–1603, led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during theTime of Troublesin the early 17th century.[81]ThePolish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, taking advantage, occupied parts of Russia, extending into the capital Moscow.[82]In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by merchantKuzma Mininand princeDmitry Pozharsky.[83]TheRomanov dynastyacceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.[84]"
"Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of theCossacks.[85]In 1654, the Ukrainian leader,Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian tsar,Alexis; whose acceptance of this offer led to anotherRusso-Polish War. Ultimately, Ukraine was split along theDnieper, leaving the eastern part, (Left-bank UkraineandKiev) under Russian rule.[86]In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of vast Siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory.Russian explorerspushed eastward primarily along theSiberian River Routes, and by the mid-17th century, there were Russian settlements in eastern Siberia, on theChukchi Peninsula, along theAmur River, and on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.[85]In 1648,Semyon Dezhnyovbecame the first European to navigate through theBering Strait.[87]"
"UnderPeter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721, and established itself as one of the European great powers. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in theGreat Northern War(1700–1721), securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter foundedSaint Petersburgas Russia's new capital. Throughout his rule,sweeping reforms were made, which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia.[88]He was succeeded byCatherine I(1725–1727), followed byPeter II(1727–1730), andAnna. The reign of Peter I's daughterElizabethin 1741–1762 saw Russia's participation in theSeven Years' War(1756–1763). During the conflict, Russian troops overranEast Prussia, reaching Berlin.[89]However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to theKingdom of Prussiaby pro-PrussianPeter III of Russia.[90]"
"Catherine II(""the Great""), who ruled in 1762–1796, presided over theRussian Age of Enlightenment. She extended Russian political control over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth andannexed most of its territories into Russia, making it the most populous country in Europe.[91]In the south, after the successfulRusso-Turkish Warsagainst theOttoman Empire, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, by dissolving theCrimean Khanate, andannexing Crimea.[92]As a result of victories overQajar Iranthrough theRusso-Persian Wars, by the first half of the 19th century, Russia alsoconquered the Caucasus.[93]Catherine's successor, her sonPaul, wasunstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues.[94]Following his short reign, Catherine's strategy was continued withAlexander I's(1801–1825)wresting of Finlandfrom the weakened Sweden in 1809,[95]and ofBessarabiafrom the Ottomans in 1812.[96]In North America, the Russians became the first Europeans toreach and colonise Alaska.[97]In 1803–1806, thefirst Russian circumnavigationwas made.[98]In 1820,a Russian expeditiondiscovered the continent ofAntarctica.[99]"
"During theNapoleonic Wars, Russia joined alliances with various European powers, and fought against France. TheFrench invasion of Russiaat the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly coldRussian winterled to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-EuropeanGrande Arméefaced utter destruction. Led byMikhail KutuzovandMichael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, theImperial Russian Armyousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in theWar of the Sixth Coalition, ultimately entering Paris.[100]Alexander Icontrolled Russia's delegation at theCongress of Vienna, which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.[101]"
"The officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia, and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortiveDecembrist revoltof 1825.[102]At the end of the conservative reign ofNicholas I(1825–1855), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in theCrimean War.[103]"
"Nicholas's successorAlexander II(1855–1881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including theemancipation reform of 1861.[104]These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of theBalkansfrom Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War.[105]During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia andBritaincolluded overAfghanistanand its neighbouring territories inCentraland South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as theGreat Game.[106]"
The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander II wasassassinatedin 1881 by revolutionary terrorists.[107]The reign of his sonAlexander III(1881–1894) was less liberal but more peaceful.[108]
"Under last Russian emperor,Nicholas II(1894–1917), theRevolution of 1905was triggered by the failure of the humiliatingRusso-Japanese War.[109]The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms (Russian Constitution of 1906), including grantingfreedoms of speechandassembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, theState Duma.[110]"
"In 1914,Russia entered World War Iin response toAustria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's allySerbia,[111]and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from itsTriple Ententeallies.[112]In 1916, theBrusilov Offensiveof the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed theAustro-Hungarian Army.[113]However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war,high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for theRussian Revolutionof 1917, carried out in two major acts.[114]In early 1917,Nicholas IIwasforced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned andlater executedduring theRussian Civil War.[115]The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself theProvisional Government,[116]and proclaimed theRussian Republic. On 19 January [O.S.6 January], 1918, theRussian Constituent Assemblydeclared Russia a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision). The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by theAll-Russian Central Executive Committee.[114]"
"An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, thePetrograd Soviet, wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, calledsoviets. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, theOctober Revolution, led byBolshevikleaderVladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the soviets, leading to the creation of the world's firstsocialist state.[114]TheRussian Civil Warbroke out between theanti-communistWhite movementand the Bolsheviks with itsRed Army.[117]In the aftermath of signing theTreaty of Brest-Litovskthat concluded hostilities with theCentral PowersofWorld War I; Bolshevist Russia surrendered most of its western territories, which hosted 34% of its population, 54% of its industries, 32% of its agricultural land, and roughly 90% of its coal mines.[118]"
"TheAllied powerslaunched an unsuccessfulmilitary interventionin support of anti-communist forces.[119]In the meantime, both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as theRed TerrorandWhite Terror.[120]By the end of the violent civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as 10 million perished during the war, mostly civilians.[121]Millions becameWhite émigrés,[122]and theRussian famine of 1921–1922claimed up to five million victims.[123]"
"On 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aidesformedtheSoviet Union, by joining theRussian SFSRinto a single state with theByelorussian,Transcaucasian, andUkrainianrepublics.[124]Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of15 republics; the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically.[125]"
"FollowingLenin's deathin 1924, atroikawas designated to take charge. EventuallyJoseph Stalin, theGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party, managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s.[126]Leon Trotsky, the main proponent ofworld revolution, was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929,[127]and Stalin's idea ofSocialism in One Countrybecame the official line.[128]The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in theGreat Purge.[129]"
"Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched acommand economy,industrialisation of the largely rural country, andcollectivisationofits agriculture. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent topenal labour camps, including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule;[130]and millions weredeported and exiledto remote areas of the Soviet Union.[131]The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought,[132]led to theSoviet famine of 1932–1933; which killed up to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the Russian SFSR.[133]The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.[134]"
"The Soviet Union enteredWorld War IIon 17 September 1939 with itsinvasion of Poland,[135]in accordance with a secret protocol within theMolotov–Ribbentrop PactwithNazi Germany.[136]The Soviet Union laterinvaded Finland,[137]andoccupied and annexed the Baltic states,[138]as well asparts of Romania.[139]: 91–95On 22 June 1941, Germanyinvaded the Soviet Union,[140]opening theEastern Front, the largest theater of World War II.[141]: 7"
"Eventually, some 5 millionRed Armytroops were captured by the Nazis;[142]: 272the latter deliberatelystarved to death or otherwise killed3.3 million SovietPOWs, and a vast number of civilians, as the ""Hunger Plan"" sought to fulfilGeneralplan Ost.[143]: 175–186Although theWehrmachthad considerable early success, their attack was halted in theBattle of Moscow.[144]Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at theBattle of Stalingradin the winter of 1942–1943,[145]and then in theBattle of Kurskin the summer of 1943.[146]Another German failure was theSiege of Leningrad, in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered.[147]Soviet forces steamrolled through Eastern and Central Europe in 1944–1945 andcaptured Berlinin May 1945.[148]In August 1945, the Red Armyinvaded Manchuriaandousted the Japanesefrom Northeast Asia, contributing to the Allied victory over Japan.[149]"
"The 1941–1945 period of World War II is known in Russia as theGreat Patriotic War.[150]The Soviet Union, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II, and later became theFour Policemen, which was the foundation of theUnited Nations Security Council.[151]: 27During the war,Soviet civilian and military death were about 26–27 million,[152]accounting for about half of allWorld War II casualties.[153]: 295TheSoviet economyand infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused theSoviet famine of 1946–1947.[154]However, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower.[155]"
"After World War II, parts of Eastern and Central Europe, includingEast Germanyand eastern parts ofAustriawere occupied byRed Armyaccording to thePotsdam Conference.[156]Dependent communist governments were installed in theEastern Blocsatellite states.[157]After becoming the world's secondnuclear power,[158]the Soviet Union established theWarsaw Pactalliance,[159]and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as theCold War, with the rivalling United States andNATO.[160]"
"AfterStalin's deathin 1953 and a short period ofcollective rule, the new leaderNikita KhrushchevdenouncedStalinand launched the policy ofde-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from theGulaglabour camps.[161]The general easement of repressive policies became known later as theKhrushchev Thaw.[162]At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United StatesJupiter missilesin Turkey and Sovietmissiles in Cuba.[163]"
"In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificialsatellite,Sputnik 1, thus starting theSpace Age.[164]RussiancosmonautYuri Gagarinbecame the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard theVostok 1crewed spacecraft on12 April 1961.[165]"
"Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period ofcollective ruleensued, untilLeonid Brezhnevbecame the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as theEra of Stagnation. The 1965Kosygin reformaimed for partialdecentralisationof theSoviet economy.[166]In 1979, after acommunist-led revolutionin Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting theSoviet–Afghan War.[167]In May 1988, theSoviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.[168]"
"From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies ofglasnost(openness) andperestroika(restructuring) in an attempt to end theperiod of economic stagnationand todemocratise the government.[169]This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country.[170]Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.[171]"
"By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as theBaltic stateschose to secede from the Soviet Union.[172]On 17 March, areferendumwas held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into arenewed federation.[173]In June 1991,Boris Yeltsinbecame the first directly electedpresidentin Russian history when he waselectedpresident of the Russian SFSR.[174]In August 1991,a coup d'état attemptby members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.[175]On 25 December 1991, following thedissolution of the Soviet Union, along with contemporary Russia, fourteen otherpost-Soviet statesemerged.[176]"
"The economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms includingprivatisationandmarket and trade liberalisationwere undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of ""shock therapy"".[177]The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of the infamousRussian oligarchs.[178]Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormouscapital flight.[179]The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—thebirth rateplummeted while thedeath rateskyrocketed,[180][181]and millions plunged into poverty;[182]while extreme corruption,[183]as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.[184]"
"In late 1993, tensions between Yeltsin and the Russian parliament culminated ina constitutional crisiswhich ended violently through military force. During the crisis, Yeltsin was backed by Western governments, and over 100 people were killed.[185]"
"In December, areferendumwas held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers.[186]The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in theNorth Caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatistIslamistinsurrections.[187]From the timeChechenseparatists declared independence in the early 1990s, anintermittent guerrilla warwas fought between the rebel groups and Russian forces.[188]Terrorist attacks against civilianswere carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of Russian civilians.[d][189]"

"Russia,countrythat stretches over a vast expanse of easternEuropeand northernAsia. Once the preeminent republic of theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics(U.S.S.R.; commonly known as theSoviet Union), Russia became an independent country after thedissolution of the Soviet Unionin December 1991."
"Russia is a land of superlatives. By far the world’s largest country, it covers nearly twice the territory ofCanada, the second largest. It extends across the whole of northern Asia and the eastern third of Europe, spanning 11time zonesand incorporating a great range ofenvironmentsand landforms, from deserts to semiarid steppes to deep forests andArctictundra. Russia contains Europe’s longest river, theVolga, and its largest lake,Ladoga. Russia also is home to the world’s deepest lake,Baikal, and the country recorded the world’s lowest temperature outside theNorthandSouthpoles."
"The inhabitants of Russia are quitediverse. Most are ethnic Russians, but there also are more than 120 other ethnic groups present, speaking many languages and followingdisparatereligious and cultural traditions. Most of the Russian population is concentrated in the European portion of the country, especially in the fertile region surroundingMoscow, the capital.MoscowandSt. Petersburg(formerly Leningrad) are the two most important cultural and financial centres in Russia and are among the most picturesque cities in the world. Russians are also populous in Asia, however; beginning in the 17th century, and particularly pronounced throughout much of the 20th century, a steady flow of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people moved eastward intoSiberia, where cities such asVladivostokandIrkutsknow flourish."
"Russia’s climate is extreme, with forbidding winters that have several times famously saved the country from foreign invaders. Although the climate adds a layer of difficulty to daily life, the land is a generous source of crops and materials, including vast reserves of oil, gas, andpreciousmetals. That richness of resources has not translated into an easy life for most of the country’s people, however; indeed, much of Russia’s history has been a grim tale of the very wealthy and powerful few ruling over a great mass of their poor and powerless compatriots.Serfdomendured well into the modern era; the years of Soviet communist rule (1917–91), especially the long dictatorship ofJoseph Stalin, saw subjugation of a different and more exacting sort."
"The Russian republic was established immediately after theRussian Revolution of 1917and became a union republic in 1922. During the post-World War II era, Russia was a central player in international affairs, locked in aCold Warstruggle with theUnited States. In 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia joined with several other former Soviet republics to form a loose coalition, theCommonwealth of Independent States(CIS). Although thedemiseof Soviet-stylecommunismand the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union brought profound political and economic changes, including the beginnings of the formation of a large middle class, for much of the postcommunist era Russians had to endure a generally weak economy, high inflation, and a complex of social ills that served to lowerlife expectancysignificantly. Despite such profound problems, Russia showed promise of achieving its potential as a world power once again, as if to exemplify a favourite proverb, stated in the 19th century by Austrian statesmanKlemens, Fürst (prince) von Metternich: “Russia is never as strong as she appears, and never as weak as she appears.”"
"Russia can boast a long tradition of excellence in every aspect of the arts and sciences. Prerevolutionary Russian society produced thewritingsand music of such giants of worldcultureasAnton Chekhov,Aleksandr Pushkin,Leo Tolstoy,Nikolay Gogol,Fyodor Dostoyevsky, andPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The 1917 revolution and the changes it brought were reflected in the works of such noted figures as the novelistsMaxim Gorky,Boris Pasternak, andAleksandr Solzhenitsynand the composersDmitry ShostakovichandSergey Prokofiev. And the late Soviet and postcommunist eras witnessed a revival of interest in once-forbidden artists such as the poetsVladimir MayakovskyandAnna Akhmatovawhile ushering in new talents such as the novelistVictor Pelevinand the writer and journalist Tatyana Tolstaya, whose celebration of the arrival of winter in St. Petersburg, a beloved event, suggests theresilienceand stoutheartedness of her people:"
"The snow begins to fall in October. People watch for it impatiently, turning repeatedly to look outside. If only it would come! Everyone is tired of the cold rain that taps stupidly on windows and roofs. The houses are so drenched that they seem about to crumble into sand. But then, just as the gloomy sky sinks even lower, there comes the hope that the boring drum of water from the clouds will finally give way to a flurry of…and there it goes: tiny dry grains at first, then an exquisitely carved flake, two, three ornate stars, followed by fat fluffs of snow, then more, more, more—a great store of cotton tumbling down."
"For the geography and history of the other former Soviet republics,seeMoldova,Estonia,Latvia,Lithuania,Belarus,Kazakhstan,Kyrgyzstan,Tajikistan,Turkmenistan,Uzbekistan,Armenia,Azerbaijan,Georgia, andUkraine.See alsoUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics."
"Russia is bounded to the north and east by the Arctic and Pacific oceans, and it has small frontages in the northwest on theBaltic SeaatSt. Petersburgand at the detached Russianoblast(region) ofKaliningrad(a part of what was onceEast Prussiaannexedin 1945), which also abutsPolandandLithuania. To the south Russia bordersNorth Korea,China,Mongolia, andKazakhstan,Azerbaijan, andGeorgia. To the southwest and west it bordersUkraine,Belarus,Latvia, andEstonia, as well asFinlandandNorway."
"Extending nearly halfway around the Northern Hemisphere and covering much of eastern and northeasternEuropeand all of northernAsia, Russia has a maximum east-west extent of some 5,600 miles (9,000 km) and a north-south width of 1,500 to 2,500 miles (2,500 to 4,000 km). There is an enormous variety of landforms and landscapes, which occur mainly in a series of broad latitudinal belts. Arctic deserts lie in the extreme north, giving way southward to the tundra and then to the forest zones, which cover about half of the country and give it much of its character. South of the forest zone lie the woodedsteppeand the steppe, beyond which are small sections of semidesert along the northern shore of theCaspian Sea. Much of Russia lies at latitudes where the winter cold is intense and where evaporation can barely keeppacewith the accumulation of moisture, engendering abundant rivers, lakes, and swamps.Permafrostcovers some 4 million square miles (10 million square km)—an area seven times larger than thedrainage basinof theVolga River, Europe’s longest river—making settlement and road building difficult in vast areas. In the European areas of Russia, the permafrost occurs in the tundra and the forest-tundra zone. In western Siberia permafrost occurs along theYenisey River, and it covers almost all areas east of the river, except for southKamchatkaprovince,Sakhalin Island, andPrimorsky Kray(the Maritime Region)."
"On the basis of geologic structure and relief, Russia can be divided into two main parts—western and eastern—roughly along the line of the Yenisey River. In the western section, which occupies some two-fifths of Russia’s total area, lowland plains predominate overvastareas broken only by low hills and plateaus. In the eastern section the bulk of the terrain is mountainous, although there are some extensive lowlands. Given these topological factors, Russia may be subdivided into six main relief regions: theKola-Karelian region, theRussian Plain, theUral Mountains, theWest Siberian Plain, theCentral Siberian Plateau, and themountains of the south and east."
"Kola-Karelia, the smallest of Russia’s relief regions, lies in the northwestern part of European Russia between the Finnish border and theWhite Sea.Kareliais a low, ice-scraped plateau with a maximum elevation of 1,896 feet (578 metres), but for the most part it is below 650 feet (200 metres); low ridges and knollsalternatewith lake- and marsh-filled hollows. TheKola Peninsulais similar, but the smallKhibiny mountainrange rises to nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 metres). Mineral-rich ancient rocks lie at or near the surface in many places."
"Western Russia makes up the largest part of one of the great lowland areas of the world, theRussian Plain(also called the East European Plain), which extends into Russia from the western border eastward for 1,000 miles (1,600 km) to the Ural Mountains and from theArctic Oceanmore than 1,500 miles (2,400 km) to theCaucasusMountains and theCaspian Sea. About half of this vast area lies at elevations of less than 650 feet (200 metres) abovesea level, and the highest point (in theValdai Hills, northwest ofMoscow) reaches only 1,125 feet (343 metres). Nevertheless, the detailedtopographyis quite varied. North of thelatitudeon which Moscow lies, features characteristic of lowland glacialdepositionpredominate, and morainic ridges, of which the most pronounced are the Valdai Hills and theSmolensk Upland, which rises to 1,050 feet (320 metres), stand out above low, poorly drained hollows interspersed with lakes and marshes. South of Moscow there is a west-east alternation of rolling plateaus and extensive plains. In the west theCentral Russian Upland, with a maximum elevation of 950 feet (290 metres), separates the lowlands of the upperDnieper Rivervalley from those of theOkaandDonrivers, beyond which theVolga Hills rise gently to 1,230 feet (375 metres) beforedescendingabruptly to theVolga River. Small river valleys are sharply incised into these uplands, whereas the major rivers cross the lowlands in broad, shallow floodplains. East of the Volga is the largeCaspian Depression, parts of which lie more than 90 feet (25 metres) below sea level. The Russian Plain also extends southward through the Azov-Caspian isthmus (in the NorthCaucasusregion) to the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, the crest line of which forms the boundary between Russia and the Transcaucasian states of Georgia and Azerbaijan; just inside this border isMount Elbrus, which at 18,510 feet (5,642 metres) is the highest point in Russia. The largeKuban andKuma plains of the North Caucasus are separated by theStavropol Uplandat elevations of 1,000 to 2,000 feet (300 to 600 metres)."
