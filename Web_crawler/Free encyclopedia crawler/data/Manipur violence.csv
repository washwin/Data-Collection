"On 3 May 2023,ethnic violenceerupted in India'snorth-easternstate ofManipurbetween theMeitei people, a majority that lives in theImphal Valley, and theKuki-Zotribal community from the surrounding hills.[45]According to government figures, as of 15 September, 175 people have been killed in the violence. 1,108 others were injured while 32 are missing. 4,786 houses were burnt and 386 religious structures including temples and churches were vandalized. The violence left more than 70,000 people displaced from their homes.[40]Unofficial figures are higher.[46][38]"
"The proximate cause of the violence was a row over anaffirmative actionmeasure. On 14 April 2023, acting on a writ petition, the Manipur High Court ordered the state government to send a recommendation to the central government on the demand for aScheduled Tribestatus by the valley-based Meitei community,[47]a decision later criticised by theSupreme Court.[48]To protest the Meitei demands for the scheduled tribe status, the All Tribal Students' Union Manipur conducted peaceful protest marches on 3 May. After one of these marches, clashes broke out between Kuki and Meitei groups near the border between theChurachandpur districtandBishnupur district, followed by house burning.[49][50]The violence quickly spread to the Kuki-dominatedChurachandpurtown and the Meitei-dominatedImphal Valley, targeting the minority community in each area. According toReuters, 77 Kukis and 10 Meiteis were killed within a week.[38]"
"In addition to the ST status, other issues had been festering prior to the violence. For example, the Kuki people in the hill districts saw themselves as being the target of the state government's treatment of indigenous land rights concerns.[51]There have been evictions of Kuki communities as a result of efforts to survey forests, which were ostensibly made to stop the cultivation ofpoppy.[52][53][54][clarification needed]"
"The Meitei community has also experienced a rise in insecurity as a result of the flood of refugees fromMyanmarfollowing themilitary coupin2021, particularly those from theSagaingregion.[55][53]In one of the instances, the Manipur government have questioned the central security forces, especially theAssam Rifles, of allowing illegal immigration from Myanmar.[56][57][58]Many organisations have protested against Assam Rifles of siding with the Kuki communities, including instance of Manipur police filing FIR against its personnel for enabling Kuki militants to escape by obstructing the police movements.[59][60]"
"According to several organisations, there have been accounts of partisan killings by security forces, as well as allegations of the police siding with the Meitei community.[61][62]"
"Manipur is a state innortheast India, borderingMyanmarto its east and south. It consists of theImphal Valley, associated with theManipur kingdom,[63]and the surrounding hills populated by hill tribes. The Imphal Valley constitutes about 10% of the geographical area of the state with 57% of the population,[64]predominantlyMeitei, who are majority Hindus, with minorities of Muslims and nativeSanamahismfollowers.[65]The surrounding hills constitute 90% of the geographical area of the state with 43% of the population belonging to 34 tribal groups broadly categorized asNagasandKukis.[65]The Nagas dominate the northern districts while the Kukis are predominant in the south. The tribal people have theScheduled Tribe(ST) status, whereas the Meitei have been accordedOther Backward Class(OBC) status, with some classified asScheduled Castes(SC) in certain areas.[66]"
"Scholars write that the hill tribes, whose administration had largely been left to the respective chiefs known as Khullakpa by the Meitei Kings, came to be administered by the British after the Anglo-Manipur War of 1891. The British administrative control became more intensive after the Kuki Rebellion of 1917–19 and they continued to administer the hill areas directly until 1947.[67][68][69]Scholars believe the colonial administration employed the ""divide and rule"" policy which widened existing divide between the peoples.[68][69][70]On the contrary, the hill regions are noted by some scholars as forming part ofZomiainhabited by ""non-state"" peoples. They came to be administered only after theKuki Rebellion of 1917–1919,[71]by British administrators without the involvement of the Meitei state. After Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status. Even though the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission,[72][73]the seventh amendment (2015) is seen as an attempt by the valley dwellers to grab tribal land.[74]The valley-based Meitei dominate the political establishment. Of the 60 Assembly constituencies, 40 are held by the valley and 20 are in the hill districts.[65][51]The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region.[75][76][45]Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads, schools or hospitals in the hills.[77]"
Tribal groups have complained that the government spending is unduly concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley.[78]
"The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) began demanding Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei people in 2012.[79]The STDCM claims the status will restore the harmonious relationship between the valley and the hills peoples before the Manipur's merger with India in 1949.[80]On the other hand, the hills people view this demand as an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the Naga and Kuki demands, and enable the Meitei to make inroads into the hill regions.[81]"
"It was reported later that the Union government and the state government had considered the issue of ST status for Meitei twice, once in 1982 and a second time in 2001, and rejected it both times. This fact was not publicised at the beginning of the conflict.[82]"
"Okram Ibobi Singhof theIndian National Congress(INC) had been in power for three terms from 2002. TheBharatiya Janata Party(BJP) came to power in 2017 for the first time under the leadership ofN. Biren Singhwho managed to out-maneuver the INC, the single largest party, and formed a minority government. In the2022 Manipur Legislative Assembly election, Biren Singh led the BJP to a clear majority increasing the seat tally from 21 (2017) to 32 (2022) in an Assembly of 60 and continued as theChief Minister.[83]The rise of BJP power in Manipur has empowered theRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) to incite the Vaishnavite Meitei to assertHindutvapolitics against religious minorities.[84]This included giving rise to Meitei-based organisations[85]and increasedvigilantism, cultural policing, and anti-minority rhetoric.[86]"
"The Myanmar Junta's crackdown on hideouts of resistance in the border districts of Myanmar[87][88][89]has caused an influx of refugees in the states of Manipur and Mizoram. Dozens of illegal immigrants including ex-security forces reportedly entered Manipur.[90][91]While the Myanmar refugees are given familial treatment with compassion to take shelter by the state government of Mizoram, the Manipur government's view on the matter is somewhat divergent.[92][93]Dominant Zo-Kuki demographic of Manipur's Churachandpur district which borders the state of Mizoram, and the dominant Mizos have strong ethnic relation with each other and also with Kukis of Myanmar. While Chief Minister Zoramthanga of Mizoram, under his governance, shows a sense of compassion towards refugees including ex-forces of Myanmar, at least some Zo-Kuki portion in Manipur are not happy with the attitude of Manipur government, under the leadership of Chief Minister N Biren Singh, towards them who are, if not together, in the proximity of Myanmar immigrants.[94][95]"
"China perceives thatIndia's Act East Policy, and closer relations with Southeast Asian nations pose a serious threat to its ambition to establish its hegemony in the region.[96][97][98][99]On 15th August 2023, Chief Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh said that certain misunderstandings, actions of vested interests and foreign conspiracies to destabilise the state led to widespread violence in Manipur.[100][101][102]"
"On 7 November 2022, the Government of Manipur passed an order setting aside previous orders from the 1970s and 1980s that excluded villages from proposedChurachandpur-Khoupum protected forest, which automatically placed 38 ancestral villages in Churachandpur in the encroaching category.[103]In February 2023, theBJPstate government began an eviction drive in districts ofChurachandpur, Kangpokpi and Tengnoupal, declaring the forest dwellers as encroachers—a move seen as anti-tribal.[104][105]"
"In March, theManipur Cabinetdecided to withdraw from theSuspension of Operationagreements with three Kuki militant groups, including theKuki National Armyand theZomi Revolutionary Army, though the central government did not support such a withdrawal.[105][106][a]Several Manipuri organisations also demonstrated in New Delhi to press for aNational Register of Citizens(NRC) to be created with 1951 as the base year, complaining of abnormal population growth in hill areas.[107]The first violence broke out as five people were injured in a clash in the Kangpokpi district, where protesters gathered to hold a rally against ""encroachment of tribal land in the name of reserved forests, protected forests and wildlife sanctuary"".[106]While, the state cabinet stated that the government will not compromise on ""steps taken to protect the state government's forest resources and for eradicating poppy cultivation"".[106]Social scientists, such as Dhanabir Laishram, have argued that targeting those poor Kuki cultivators alone would be futile. A rich section of the Meitei community is blamed to be one of the major funders.[108]On 11 April, three churches inImphal's Tribal Colony locality were razed for being illegal constructions on government land.[106]"
"On 20 April 2023, a judge of theManipur High Courtdirected thestate governmentto ""consider request of theMeiteicommunity to be included in theScheduled Tribes(ST) list.""[109]TheKukisfeared that the ST status would allow the Meiteis purchase land in the prohibitedhilly areas.[107]"
"The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) called for a total shut down on 28 April in protest of the state government actions, a day that also happened to have been scheduled for the chief ministerN. Biren Singhto visitChurachandpurfor the inauguration of an open air gym. The day before the visit, a mob set fire to the gym and vandalised it. The ITLF claimed that it started the agitation as the state government was not addressing the plight of the people.[110][111]Section 144was invoked on 28 April as well as a five-day Internet shut down. The protesters clashed with the police and tear gas shells were used to disperse the mobs.[110]"
"What has been said, openly, including by Chief Minister Biren Singh, is that too many “foreign” (Myanmar Kukis) are involved, there is foreign (Chinese, he insinuated) hand, and that the Kuki tribals are forest encroachers, illicit poppy growers, drug smugglers and terrorists. “Terrorist” is an expression he has used for them more than once and it has been widely reported in the national broadsheets.[112]"
"On 3 May, the tribal organisation All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM), opposing the Meitei demand for ST status, conducted a ""Tribal Solidarity March"". Tens of thousands of protesters participated in the march across all hill districts of Manipur.[110][107]According to the Union Home Ministry, the call for the march also generated a ""counter response"" by the Meitei.[113]Reports were received of a counter-blockade atTorbungnear theBishnupur–Churachandpurdistrict border,[114][115][116]and a counter-agitation in the surrounding valley areas (such as the Kangvai village), where houses were attacked by Meitei mobs.[117][118][119]Two dead bodies were discovered in the Kangvai village and tyres were burnt at the base of the Anglo-Kuki War Memorial gate at Leisang as an apparent provocation.[120][121][122]"
"After the reportedly peaceful rally in theChurachandpurtown in which 100,000 people participated,[123][113]rallyists returning to the Torbung–Kangvai area[b]faced the ""counter-blockade"" by the Meitei groups. This resulted in stone-throwing and arson of vehicles and properties. The Kangvai village in the Bishnupur district was burnt down.[114][121]These events caused a large number of Kuki-Zo people from Churachandpur side to rush to the clash site and participate in the clashes, including the burning of theBanglavillage in Churachandpur district.[125][c]About 80 people were injured in the violence who were taken to the Churachandpur District Hospital, of which three people died by the next morning.[127]"
"By the evening, clashes spread to theChurachandpur town, where Meitei settlements were attacked, and theImphal City, where Kuki-Zo settlements were attacked. Violence continued through the night of 3 May. Residences and churches of the Kuki tribal population were attacked in the valley areas.[76][45]According to the police, many houses of the tribal population in Imphal were attacked and 500 occupants were displaced and had to take shelter inLamphelpat. Around 1000 Meiteis affected by the violence also had to flee from the region and take shelter inBishnupur. Twenty houses were burnt in the city ofKangpokpi.[128]Violence was observed inChurachandpur,Kakching, Canchipur, Soibam Leikai, Tengnoupal, Langol, Kangpokpi and Moreh while mostly being concentrated in theImphal Valleyduring which several houses, places of worship and other properties were burnt and destroyed.[115][128]"

The police force had to fire several rounds oftear gasshells to control the rioters.[115]KukiMLAVunzjagin Valte(BJP), who is the representative of the tribal headquarters of Churachandpur, was attacked during the riots while he was returning from the state secretariat. His condition was reported to be critical on 5 May, while a person accompanying him died.[129][130]The government said around 1700 houses and numerous vehicles were burned down during the violence.[131][132]"

"On 4 May, it was widely reported that theUnion governmenthad invoked theArticle 355of the Indian Constitution to take over the security situation of Manipur.[142][143][144]However, no notification was issued to this effect.[145][146]Nevertheless, the Home Ministry appointed a security advisor to the Manipur chief minister, Kuldip Singh, who previously headed theCRPF, and an overall commander for the law and order situation, Ashutosh Sinha.[146]"
"The insertion of troops led to several engagements between hill-based militants and theIndian Reserve Battalion, resulting in at least five militant deaths. In a separate encounter, four militants were killed.
