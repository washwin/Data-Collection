"Manipur(/ˌmʌnɪˈpʊər/,[8]USalso/ˌmænɪˈpʊər/;[9]Meitei:Kangleipak[a][10][11][12]) is astateinnortheast India, with the city ofImphalas its capital.[13]It is bounded by the Indian states ofNagalandto the north,Mizoramto the south andAssamto the west. It also borders two regions ofMyanmar,Sagaing Regionto the east andChin Stateto the south. The state covers an area of 22,327 km2(8,621 sq mi). The official and most widely spoken language is theMeitei language(officially known as Manipuri). Native to theMeitei people, it is also used as alingua francaby smaller communities, who speak a variety of otherTibeto-Burman languages.[14]Manipur has been at the crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years.[15]This exchange connects theIndian subcontinentandCentral AsiatoSoutheast Asia,East Asia,Siberia, regions in theArctic,MicronesiaandPolynesiaenabling migration of people, cultures and religions.[16][17]"
"During the days of theBritish Raj, theKingdom of Manipurwas one of theprincely states.[18]Between 1917 and 1939, some people of Manipur pressed the princely rulers for democracy. By the late 1930s, the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to continue to be part of theBritish Rajrather than part ofBritish-ruled Burma, which was being separated from India. These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak ofWorld War IIin 1939. On 11 August 1947,Maharaja Budhachandrasigned anInstrument of Accession, joining the new Indian Union.[19][20]Later, on 21 September 1949, he signed a Merger Agreement, merging the kingdom into India, which led to its becoming aPart C State.[21][22]This merger was later disputed by groups in Manipur, as having been completed without consensus and under duress.[23]The dispute and differing visions for the future has resulted in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India, as well as in repeated episodes of violence among ethnic groups in the state.[24]From 2009 through 2018, the conflict was responsible for the violent deaths of over 1000 people.[25]"
"TheMeitei people[26]represent around 53% of the population of Manipur state, followed by variousNagaethnic groups at 24% and variousKuki/Zotribes (also known asChin-Kuki-Mizo people) at 16%.[27]Manipur's ethnic groups practice a variety of religions.[28]According to 2011 census,HinduismandChristianityare the major religions of the state.[28][29]Between the 1961 and 2011 censuses of India, the share ofHindusin the state declined from 62% to 41%, while the share ofChristiansrose from 19% to 41%.[30]"
"Manipur has primarily an agrarian economy, with significant hydroelectric power generation potential. It is connected to other areas by daily flights throughImphal Airport, the second largest in northeastern India.[31]Manipur is home to many sports and the origin ofManipuri dance,[32]and is credited with introducingpoloto Europeans.[33]"
"TwoSanskritwords compose the name ""Manipur"":  ""Maṇi"", which means jewel, and ""purǝ"", which means land, place, or abode.  Thus, ""Manipur"" may be translated as ""Jewelled land"".[citation needed][verification needed]"
"Manipur is mentioned in older texts as ""Kangleipak"" (Meitei:ꯀꯪꯂꯩꯄꯛ)[10][34][11][12]or ""Meeteileipak"".[35]Sanamahi Laikan wrote that officials during the reign ofMeidingu Pamheibain the eighteenth century adopted Manipur's new name."
"Neighbouring cultures each had differing names for Manipur and its people. TheShanorPongcalled the areaCassay; theBamarsKathe, and theAssameseMeklee. In the first treaty between the BritishEast India Companyand MeidinguChing-Thang Khomba(Bhagyachandra), signed in 1762, the kingdom was referred to as ""Meckley"". Bhagyachandra and his successors issued coins engraved with ""Manipureshwar"", or ""lord of Manipur"", and the British soon discarded the name of Meckley. Later, the workDharani Samhita(1825–34) popularised theSanskrit legendsof the origin of Manipur's name.[36]"
"The termKanglei, meaning ""of Manipur/Kangleipak"", is used to refer to items associated with the state where the termManipuriis a recently given name."
"The history of Manipur Meiteis is chronicled inPuyasor Puwaris (stories about the forefathers), namely, the Ninghthou Kangbalon, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Ningthourol Lambuba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, Panthoibi Khongkul, and so forth in theMeitei script, which is comparable to theThai script. The historical accounts presented here were recordings from the eyes and the judgment of Meitei kings andMaichou[simple](Meitei scholars). Hill tribes have folk tales, myths, and legends. Manipur was known by different names at various periods in its history, such as Tilli-Koktong, Poirei-Lam, Sanna-Leipak, Mitei-Leipak, Meitrabak or Manipur (present day). Its capital was Kangla, Yumphal or Imphal (present day). Its people were known by various names, such as Mi-tei, Poirei-Mitei, Meetei, Maitei or Meitei. The Puwaris, Ninghthou Kangbalon, Ningthourol Lambuba, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, recorded the events of each King who ruled Manipur over more than 3500 years until 1955 CE (a total of more than 108 kings).[citation needed]"
"According to the Tai chronicles, Manipur (Kahse) is one of the territories conquered by Samlongpha (1150–1201), the firstChao PhaofMogaung.[37]A 14th-century inscription fromPagan,Myanmar, mentions Kasan (Manipur) as one of the 21 states under theMong Maoruler Thonganbwa (1413–1445/6); he later was captured by the Governor ofTaungdwingyi.[38]Ningthou Kangba(15th century BCE) is regarded as the first and foremost king of Manipur. There were times when the country was in turmoil without rulers, and long historical gaps exist between 1129 BCE and 44 BCE."
"In 1891 CE, as a result of the British defeat of the Meiteis in the Anglo-Manipuri war of Khongjom, Manipur lost the sovereignty which it had maintained for more than three millennia. From 1926 until 4 January 1947, Manipur was just one of thePakokkuHill Tracts Districts ofBritish Burma. Manipur regained its separate identity on 14 August 1947 and, on 15 October 1949, wasunified with India.[39]"
"By the medieval period, marriage alliances between the royal families of Manipur,Ahom kingdomandBurmahad become common.[39]Medieval era manuscripts discovered in the 20th century, particularly thePuya, provide evidence that Hindus from the Indian subcontinent had married Manipur royalty by at least the 14th century. In centuries thereafter, royal spouses came also from what is now Assam,Bengal, andUttar Pradeshand from otherSouth Indiankingdoms as well.[40]Another manuscript suggests that Muslims arrived in Manipur in the 17th century, from what is nowBangladesh, during the reign of MeidinguKhagemba.[40]The socio-political turmoil and wars, particularly the persistent and devastatingAnglo-Burmese wars, affected the cultural and religious demography of Manipur.[41]"
"In 1824, the ruler of Manipur entered into asubsidiary alliancewith the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, which became responsible for Manipur's external defence. The British recognised that the state remained internally self-governing, as aprincely state.[42]DuringWorld War II, Manipur was the scene of many fierce battles between Japanese invaders and British Indian forces. TheJapanesewere beaten back before they could enterImphal, which was one of the turning points of the overall war in South Asia.[43]TheBattle of Imphal, known to the Manipuris asJapan Laan, are among the lesser-known battles of the Second World War. Yet the Allied Victory in this battle was a turning point against the Japanese in East Asia.[44][45][46][47]"
"After the war,Indiamoved towards independence, and the princely states which had existed alongside it became responsible for their own external affairs and defence, unless they joined the new Indian Union or Pakistan. TheManipur State Constitution Act of 1947established a democratic form of government, with theMaharajacontinuing as the head of state.[48]Maharaja Bodhchandrawas summoned toShillong, to merge the kingdom into the Union of India.[49]He is believed to have signed the merger agreement under duress.[50]Thereafter, the legislative assembly was dissolved, and in October 1949 Manipur became part of India.[51]It was made a Union Territory in 1956.[52]and a fully-fledged state in 1972 by theNorth-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971.[53]"
"Manipur has a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence.[54][55]Its first armed opposition group, theUnited National Liberation Front(UNLF), was founded in 1964 aiming to achieve independence from India and establish Manipur as a new country. Over time, many more groups formed, each with different goals, and deriving support from diverse ethnic groups in Manipur. ThePeople's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak(PREPAK) was formed in 1977, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1978, suspected byHuman Rights Watchof receiving arms and training from China.[56]In 1980, theKangleipak Communist Party(KCP) was formed. These groups began a spree of bank robberies and attacks on police officers and government buildings.[56]The state government appealed to the central government inNew Delhifor support in combating this violence.[24]"
"From 1980 to 2004, the Indian government referred to Manipur as adisturbed area.This term (designated by theMinistry of Home Affairsor astate governor) refers to a territory where extraordinary laws under theArmed Forces (Special Powers) Actcan be used. The laws allow the military to treat private and public spaces in the same manner, detain individuals for up to 24 hours with unlimited renewals, perform warrantless searches, and to shoot and kill individuals who break laws, carry weapons, or gather in groups larger than four. Legal immunity applies to the military.[57]Since 1980, the application of AFSPA has been at the heart of concerns abouthuman rightsviolations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel,inhuman and degrading treatment, andforced disappearances. Its continued application has led to numerous protests, notably the longstanding hunger strike byIrom Sharmila Chanu.[58][59]"
"In 2004, the government lifted thedisturbedstatus after a violent attack on a local woman. The rape of a Manipuri woman,Thangjam Manorama Devi, by members of theAssam Riflesparamilitary had led to wide protests including a nude protest by theMeira Paibiwomen's association.[60]"
"In May 2023, an ethnic clash betweenMeitei peopleandKuki peopleled to extensive violence and arson, resulting in 60,000 people displaced from their homes and hundreds more dead and hospitalized.[61]According to data released byManipur Police, as on September 15, 2023; 175 people have been killed; 1,118 people were injured, and 33 people were missing. 96 bodies remained unclaimed. 5,172 cases of arson including destruction of 4,786 houses and 386 religious places, out of which there were 254 churches and 132 temples, were reported since May. Out of 5,668 arms lost; 1,329 arms, 15,050 ammunition and 400 bombs were recovered.[62][63][64]Indian armytroops were deployed to control the situation.[65]International outrage resulted from a report that two Kuki women had been paraded naked and allegedly gang-raped by a mob of Meitei men.[66][67][68]"
"The state lies at a latitude of 23°83'N – 25°68'N and a longitude of 93°03'E – 94°78'E. The total area covered by the state is 22,327 km2(8,621 sq mi). The capital lies in an oval-shaped valley of approximately 700 sq mi (2,000 km2), surrounded by blue mountains, at an elevation of 790 m (2,590 ft) above sea level.[69]The slope of the valley is from north to south. The mountain ranges create a moderate climate, preventing the cold winds from the north from reaching the valley and barring cyclonic storms.[70]"
"The state is bordered by the Indian states ofNagalandto its north,Mizoramto its south, Assam to its west, and shares an international border withMyanmarto its east.[71]"
"The state has four major river basins: theBarak River Basin(Barak Valley) to the west, theManipur River Basinin central Manipur, theYu River Basinin the east, and a portion of the Lanye River Basin in the north.[72]The water resources of Barak and Manipur river basins are about 1.8487 Mham (million hectare metres). The overall water balance of the state amounts to 0.7236 Mham in the annual water budget.[73](By comparison, India receives 400 Mham of rain annually.[74])"
"The Barak River, the largest of Manipur, originates in the Manipur Hills and is joined by tributaries, such as the Irang, Maku, andTuivai. After its junction with the Tuivai, the Barak River turns north, forms the border withAssam State, and then enters theCacharAssam just aboveLakhipur. The Manipur river basin has eight major rivers: theManipur,Imphal,Iril, Nambul, Sekmai, Chakpi, Thoubal and Khuga. All these rivers originate from the surrounding hills.[75]"
"Almost all the rivers in the valley area are in the mature stage and therefore deposit their sediment load in theLoktak Lake.[69]The rivers draining the Manipur Hills are comparatively young, due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive and become turbulent in the rainy season. Important rivers draining the western area include the Maku,Barak, Jiri, Irang, and Leimatak. Rivers draining the eastern part of the state, the Yu River Basin, include the Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.[75]"
"Manipur may be characterised as two distinct physical regions: an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys, and the inner area of flat plain, with all associated landforms. These two areas are distinct in physical features and are conspicuous in flora and fauna. The valley region has hills and mounds rising above the flat surface. The Loktak Lake is an important feature of the central plain. The total area occupied by all the lakes is about 600 km2. The altitude ranges from 40 m atJiribamto 2,994 m atMount Tempüpeak along the border with Nagaland."
"The soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the redferruginoussoil in the hill area and thealluviumin the valley. The valley soils generally contain loam, small rock fragments, sand, and sandy clay, and are varied. On the plains, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is quite thick. The topsoil on the steep slopes is very thin. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subject to high erosion, resulting ingulliesand barren rock slopes. The normal pH value ranges from 5.4 to 6.8.[76]"
"Natural vegetation occupies an area of about 17,418 km2(6,725 sq mi),[77]or 77.2% of the total geographical area of the state, and consists of short and tall grasses, reeds andbamboos, and trees. About a third of Manipur's forests are protected: 8.42% of the forested land is categorized under Reserved Forests, and 23.95 % under Protected Forests.[78]"
"There are six major types of forests in Manipur, and 10 subtypes. The six major forest types, according to the state's Forest Department, include Tropical Wet Evergreen Forest, Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests, Sub-Tropical Pine Forest, Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest, Montane Wet Temperate Forest and Sub-alpine Forest.[78]"
"There are forests ofteak,pine,oak,uningthou, leihao, bamboo, andcane.Rubber,tea,coffee,orange, andcardamomare grown in hill areas.Riceis a staple food for Manipuris.[71]"
"Manipur's climate is largely influenced by the topography of the region. Lying 790 metres above sea level, Manipur is wedged among hills on all sides. This northeastern corner of India enjoys a generally amiable climate, though the winters can be chilly. The maximum temperature in the summer months is 32 °C (90 °F). The coldest month is January, and the warmest July.[citation needed]"
"The state receives an average annual rainfall of 1,467.5 mm (57.78 in) between April and mid-October. Precipitation ranges from light drizzle to heavy downpour. The capital cityImphalreceives an annual average of 933 mm (36.7 in). Rainfall in this region is caused by The South WesterlyMonsoonpicking up moisture from theBay of Bengaland heading towards theEastern Himalayaranges. This normal rainfall pattern of Manipur enriches the soil and much of the agrarian activities are dependent on it as well."
"Manipur is alreadyexperiencing climate change, especiallychanges in weather, with both increasedvariability in rainas well as increasingly severe changes in temperature.[79]"
"Manipur has a population of 2,855,794 as per 2011 census.[81]Of this total, 57.2% live in the valley districts and the remaining 42.8% in the hill districts. The valley (plain) is mainly inhabited by theMeitei speaking population(nativeManipurispeakers). The hills are inhabited mainly by several ethno-linguistically diverse tribes belonging to theNagas, theKukisand smaller tribal groupings. Naga and Kuki settlements are also found in the valley region, though less in numbers. There are also sizable population of Nepalis, Bengalis, Tamils and Marwaris living in Manipur.[citation needed][verification needed]"
"The distribution of area, population and density, and literacy rate as per the 2001 Census provisional figures are as below:[citation needed]"
"TheMeiteis[26](synonymous to theManipuris) constitute the majority of the state's population. They inhabit theImphal Valley. Nagas and Kuki-Zo are the major tribe conglomerates of tribes inhabiting the surrounding hills. The Kuki-Zos consist of several tribes includingGangte,Hmar,Paite,Simte,Sukte,Thadou,Vaiphei,Zou, and some smaller tribes. They speakKuki-Chin languagesand predominate the southern hill districts of Manipur. The prominent Naga tribes areAngami,Kabui,Kacha Naga,Mao,Maram,Poumai,SemaandTangkhul, each speaking its own language. They predominate the northern hill districts of Manipur. In addition, several smaller tribes that were classified as ""Old Kuki"" by the British administrators populateChandeland neighbouring districts. Some of them now classify themselves as Nagas while others retain the Kuki classification.[b][83][84][85]"

Languages in Manipur (2011)[89]
"The official language of the state isMeitei(also known asManipuri). It is ascheduled languagein the Republic of India,[90]and serves as thelingua francain Manipur.[91]"
"Other than Meitei language, in Manipur, there is a huge amount of linguistic diversity, as is the case in most of the Northeast India. Almost all of the languages areSino-Tibetan, with many different subgroups represented. There are multipleKuki-Chin languages, the largest beingThadouand is spoken in all the hill districts. Another major language family is theNaga languages, likeTangkhul,Poula,RongmeiandMao. Less than 5% speak Indo-European languages, mostlyNepaliandSylheti(also considered as a dialect ofBengali), which is the major language ofJiribam district.[92]"
TheDirectorate of Language Planning and Implementation(AKADepartment of Language Planning and Implementation) of theGovernment of Manipurworks for the development and the promotion of Meitei language and other local vernaculars of Manipur.[93]
Religion in Manipur (2011)[94]
"HinduismandChristianityare the major religions practiced in Manipur. Between the 1961 and 2011 censuses of India, the share ofHindusin the state declined from 62% to 41%, while the share ofChristiansrose from 19% to 41%.[95]The religious groups of the Meitei-speaking people includeHindus,Sanamahists,Meitei ChristiansandMeitei Pangals. Besides these, the non Meitei-speaking communities (tribals) are mostly Christians."
"TheMeitei ethnicity(akaManipuri people) is the majority group following Hinduism in Manipur, beside other minor immigrants following the same faith in the state. Among the indigenous communities of Manipur,Meiteisare the only Hindus as no other indigenous ethnic groups follow this faith. 
According to the2011 Census of India, about 41.39% of the Manipuri people practiceHinduism. The Hindu population is heavily concentrated in the Meitei dominant areas of the Manipur Valley (Imphal Valley), among the Meitei people. The districts of Bishnupur, Thoubal, Imphal East, and Imphal West all have Hindu majorities, averaging 67.62% (range 62.27–74.81%) according to the 2011 census data.[94]"
"Vaishnavite Hinduism was the state religion of theKingdom of Manipur. In 1704, Meitei KingCharairongbaaccepted Vaishnavism and changed his traditional Meitei name into Hindu name, Pitambar Singh.[96]However, the first Hindu temples were constructed much earlier. A copper plate excavated fromPhayengdating back to 763 CE (believed to be of the reign of Meitei King Khongtekcha) was found to contain inscriptions about the Hindu deities in Sanskrit words.[97]During the 13th century, Meitei King Khumomba constructed a Lord Hanuman temple.[98]The Vishnu temple at Lamangdong was constructed during 1474 CE (during the reign of Meitei KingKiyamba), by Brahmins immigrating from the neighborhoodShan State. As per the legends, the temple was constructed to house the Vishnu emblem given to King Kiyamba by King Khekhomba of Shan. Phurailatpam Shubhi Narayan was the first Brahmin priest of this temple.[99]"
"Christianity is the religion of 41% of the people in the state, but is the majority in rural areas with 53%, and is predominant in the hills. It was brought by Protestant missionaries to Manipur in the 19th century. In the 20th century, a few Christian schools were established, which introduced Western-type education. Christianity is the predominant religion among tribals of Manipur and tribal Christians make up the vast majority (over 96%) of the Christian population in Manipur.[100]"
"TheMeitei Pangals(Meitei:ꯃꯩꯇꯩ ꯄꯥꯡꯒꯜ), also known as theMeitei Muslimsor theManipuri Muslims, are the third largest religious majority group in the state as they constitute about 8.3% of the state population as per 2011 census. They belong to theSunnigroup of theHanafischool of Islamic thought and there are Arab, Bangladeshi, Turani, Bengali and Mughal or Chaghtai Turk sections among theseMeiteispeaking Muslims.[101]"
"Sanamahism(often referred to as traditionalMeitei religion) is the ancient polytheistic indigenous animisticethnic religionof theMeitei people, the predominant ethnic group of Manipur.[102]Sanamahist worship concentrates on the household deityLainingthou Sanamahi(often associated as well as confused with direct Sun GodKorouhanba). The ancient Meiteis worshiped a Supreme deity, Salailen, and followed their ancestors. Their ancestor worship and animism was based onUmang Lai– ethnic governing deities worshiped in thesacred groves. Some of the traditionalMeitei deities(Lais) are Atiya Sidaba,Pakhangba,Sanamahi,Leimaren,Panthoibi,Imoinu,Thangching(Thangjing),Marjing,Wangpulen(Wangbaren) andKoupalu(Koubru). Out of the 233,767 people who opted for the ""Other religion"" option, 222,315 were Sanamahists.[citation needed]"
"The various other religions were mostly followers of tribal folk religions, 6,444 were Heraka, 2,032 were Jewish and 1,180 were from other tribal religions such as Tingkao Ragwang Chapriak.[citation needed]"
"The government of Manipur is a collective assembly of 60 elected members, of which 19 are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and 1 for Scheduled Castes.[103]The state sends two representatives to the Lok Sabha of theParliament of India. The state sends one representative to the Rajya Sabha. The legislature of the state is Unicameral.[104]Representatives are elected for a five-year term to the state assembly and the Indian parliament through voting, a process overseen by the offices of the Election Commission of India.[105]"
The state hasone autonomous council.
There were many public movements in Manipur against the government:
"The violence in Manipur extends beyond the conflict between Indian security forces and insurgent armed groups. There is violence between theMeitei ethnicity, variousNaga tribes, variousKuki tribes, and other tribal groups.[24]"
"Splinter groups have arisen within some of the armed groups, and disagreement between them is rife. Other than the UNLF, PLA, and PREPAK, Manipuri insurgent groups include the Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF), Manipur Liberation Front Army (MLFA), Kanglei Yawol Kanba Lup (KYKL), Revolutionary Joint Committee (RJC), Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF), Manipur Naga People Front (MNPF), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-I/M), United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF), Kuki National Front (KNF), Kuki National Army (KNA), Kuki Defence Force (KDF), Kuki Democratic Movement (KDM), Kuki National Organisation (KNO), Kuki Security Force (KSF), Chin Kuki Revolutionary Front (CKRF), Kom Rem Peoples Convention (KRPC), Zomi Revolutionary Volunteers (ZRV), Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Zomi Reunification Organisation (ZRO), and Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC).[107][24]"
"The Meitei insurgent groups seek independence from India. The Kuki insurgent groups want a separate state for the Kukis to be carved out from the present state of Manipur. The Kuki insurgent groups are under two umbrella organisations: the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and United Peoples Forum.[108]The Nagas wish to annex part of Manipur and merge with a greater Nagaland or Nagalim, which is in conflict with Meitei insurgent demands for the integrity of their vision of an independent state. There have been many tensions between the tribes and numerous clashes between Naga and Kukis, Meiteis and Muslims.[24]"
"According to SATP in 2014, there had been a dramatic decline in fatalities in Manipur since 2009. In 2009, 77 civilians died (about 3 per 100,000 people).[25]From 2010 onward, about 25 civilians have died in militant-related violence (about 1 per 100,000 people), dropping further to 21 civilian deaths in 2013 (or 0.8 per 100,000 people). However, there were 76 explosions in 2013 compared to 107 in 2012. Different groups have claimed responsibility for the explosions, some claiming they were targeting competing militant groups, others claiming their targets were state and central government officials.[109]As a point of comparison, the average annual global rate of violent death between 2004 and 2009 was 7.9 per 100,000 people.[110]"
"The 2012–2013 gross state domestic product of Manipur at market prices was about₹10,188 crore(US$1.3 billion).[111]Its economy is primarily agriculture, forestry, cottage and trade driven.[112]Manipur acts as India's ""Gateway to the East"" throughMorehandTamutowns, the land route for trade between India and Burma and other countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia. Manipur has the highest number of handicraft units and the highest number of craftspersons in the northeastern region of India.[113]"
"Manipur produced about 0.1 GWh (0.36 TJ) of electricity in 2010 with its infrastructure.[114]The state hashydroelectric powergeneration potential, estimated to be over 2 GWh (7.2 TJ). As of 2010, if half of this potential is realised, it is estimated that this would supply24/7electricity to all residents, with a surplus for sale, as well as supplying the Burma power grid.[115]"
"Manipur's climate and soil conditions make it ideally suited for horticultural crops. Growing there are rare and exoticmedicinalandaromatic plants.[113]Some cash crops suited for Manipur includeLychee,Cashew,Walnut,Orange,Lemon,Pineapple,Papaya,Passion Fruit,Peach,PearandPlum.[112]The state is covered with over 3,000 km2(1,200 sq mi) of bamboo forests, making it one of India's largest contributor to its bamboo industry.[113]"
"Agriculture in Manipur includes a number ofsmallholdingfarms, many of whom are owned by women.[116]Climate change, especially changes in temperature and weather are hurting small farmers in the state.[117]Likerural women in other parts of the world, women in agriculture in Manipur are harmed more by the changes in weather, because of less access to support from local governments.[116]"
"Tulihal Airport, Changangei, Imphal, the only airport of Manipur, connects directly withDelhi,Kolkata,Guwahati, andAgartala. It has been upgraded to aninternational airport. As India's second largest airport in the northeast, it serves as a key logistical centre for northeastern states. The Tulihal Airport has been renamed Bir Tikendrajit Airport.[31]National Highway NH-39links Manipur with the rest of the country through the railway stations atDimapurin Nagaland at a distance of 215 km (134 mi) from Imphal.[citation needed][verification needed]"
"National Highway 53 (India)connects Manipur with another railway station atSilcharin Assam, which is 269 km (167 mi) away from Imphal. The road network of Manipur, with a length of 7,170 km (4,460 mi) connects all the important towns and distant villages. However, the road condition throughout the state is often deplorable.[118][119]In 2010, Indian government announced that it is considering an Asian infrastructure network from Manipur toVietnam.[120]The proposedTrans-Asian Railway(TAR), if constructed, will pass through Manipur, connecting India toBurma,Thailand,MalaysiaandSingapore."
"The tourist season is from October to February when it is often sunny without being hot and humid.[citation needed]The culture features martial arts, dance, theatre and sculpture. Greenery accompanies a moderate climate. The seasonalShirui Lilyplant atUkhrul(district),Dzüko Valleyat Senapati,Sangai(Brow antlered deer) and thefloating islandsatLoktak Lakeare among the rarities of the area.Polo, which can be called a royal game, originated in Manipur."
"TheKeibul Lamjao National Park(KLNP), which is the world's only floating national park, located in theLoktak lake,[121][122]is under the tentative lists of theUNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the title""Keibul Lamjao Conservation Area (KLCA)"", additionally covering the buffer ofLoktak Lake(140 sq km) andPumlen Pat(43 sq. km), besides the 40 sq km of the KLNP.[123][124]"

"The world ofPhampak lila(stage drama) performed in the proscenium theatre is similar, in form, to the Western theatrical model and IndianNatyasastramodel though its contents are indigenous. The so-called modern theatre descended on Manipur theatre culture with the performance of Pravas Milan (1902) under the enthusiastic patronage ofSir Churchand Maharaj(1891–1941).

The coconut is greased to make it slippery. There are rules of the game, as with all Manipur sports.[145]The coconut serves the purpose of a ball and is offered to the king, the chief guest or the judges before the game begins. The aim is to run while carrying the greased coconut and physically cross over the goal line, while the other team tackles and blocks any such attempt as well as tries to grab the coconut and score on its own. In Manipur's long history, Yubi lakpi was the annual official game, attended by the king, over the Hindu festival of Shree Govindajee.[146]It is like the game ofrugby,[147]or American football.[148]"

It also borders two regions ofMyanmar,Sagaing Regionto the east andChin Stateto the south. The state covers an area of 22,327\xa0km2(8,621\xa0sq\xa0mi). The official and most widely spoken language is theMeitei language(officially known as Manipuri). Native to theMeitei people, it is also used as alingua francaby smaller communities, who speak a variety of otherTibeto-Burman languages.[14]Manipur has been at the crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years.[15]This exchange connects theIndian subcontinentandCentral AsiatoSoutheast Asia,East Asia,Siberia, regions in theArctic,MicronesiaandPolynesiaenabling migration of people, cultures and religions.[16][17]', 'During the days of theBritish Raj, theKingdom of Manipurwas one of theprincely states.[18]Between 1917 and 1939, some people of Manipur pressed the princely rulers for democracy. By the late 1930s, the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to continue to be part of theBritish Rajrather than part ofBritish-ruled Burma, which was being separated from India. These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak ofWorld War IIin 1939. On 11 August 1947,Maharaja Budhachandrasigned anInstrument of Accession, joining the new Indian Union.[19][20]Later, on 21 September 1949, he signed a Merger Agreement, merging the kingdom into India, which led to its becoming aPart C State.[21][22]This merger was later disputed by groups in Manipur, as having been completed without consensus and under duress.[23]The dispute and differing visions for the future has resulted in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India, as well as in repeated episodes of violence among ethnic groups in the state.[24]From 2009 through 2018, the conflict was responsible for the violent deaths of over 1000 people.[25]', ""TheMeitei people[26]represent around 53% of the population of Manipur state, followed by variousNagaethnic groups at 24% and variousKuki/Zotribes (also known asChin-Kuki-Mizo people) at 16%.[27]Manipur's ethnic groups practice a variety of religions.[28]According to 2011 census,HinduismandChristianityare the major religions of the state.[28][29]Between the 1961 and 2011 censuses of India, the share ofHindusin the state declined from 62% to 41%, while the share ofChristiansrose from 19% to 41%.[30]"", 'Manipur has primarily an agrarian economy, with significant hydroelectric power generation potential.

The historical accounts presented here were recordings from the eyes and the judgment of Meitei kings andMaichou[simple](Meitei scholars). Hill tribes have folk tales, myths, and legends.
