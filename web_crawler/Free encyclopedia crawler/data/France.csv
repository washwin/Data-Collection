"France(French:[fʁɑ̃s]ⓘ), officially theFrench Republic(French:République française[ʁepyblikfʁɑ̃sɛːz]),[14]is a country located primarily inWestern Europe. It also includesoverseas regions and territoriesin theAmericasand theAtlantic,PacificandIndianoceans,[XII]giving it one of the largest discontiguousexclusive economic zonesin the world.Metropolitan Franceshares borders withBelgiumandLuxembourgto the north,Germanyto the north east,Switzerlandto the east,ItalyandMonacoto the south east,AndorraandSpainto the south, and a maritime border with theUnited Kingdomto the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from theRhineto the Atlantic Ocean and from theMediterranean Seato theEnglish Channeland theNorth Sea. Its overseas territories includeFrench GuianainSouth America,Saint Pierre and Miquelonin the North Atlantic, theFrench West Indies, and many islands inOceaniaand theIndian Ocean. Itseighteen integral regions(five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2(248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024[update].[5][8]France is aunitarysemi-presidentialrepublicwith its capital inParis, the country'slargest cityand main cultural and commercial centre; other majorurban areasincludeMarseille,Lyon,Toulouse,Lille,Bordeaux,Strasbourg,NantesandNice."
"Metropolitan France was settled during theIron AgebyCeltic tribesknown asGaulsbeforeRome annexed the areain 51 BC, leading to a distinctGallo-Roman culture. In theEarly Middle Ages, theGermanicFranksformed the Kingdom ofFrancia, which became the heartland of theCarolingian Empire. TheTreaty of Verdunof 843 partitioned the empire, withWest Franciaevolving into theKingdom of France. In theHigh Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralizedfeudalkingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict withEnglandknown as theHundred Years' War. In the 16th century, theFrench Renaissancesaw culture flourish and aFrench colonial empirerise.[15]Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with theHouse of Habsburgand theFrench Wars of ReligionbetweenCatholicsandHuguenots. France was successful in theThirty Years' Warand further increased its influence during the reign ofLouis XIV.[16]"
"TheFrench Revolutionof 1789 overthrew theAncien Régimeand produced theDeclaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century underNapoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing theFirst French Empire. TheFrench RevolutionaryandNapoleonic Warssignificantly shaped the course of European history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of theFrench Third Republicduring theFranco-Prussian Warin 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as theBelle Époque. France was one of themajor participantsofWorld War I, from whichit emerged victoriousat great human and economic cost. It was among theAllied powersofWorld War II, but it surrendered andwas occupiedby theAxisin 1940. Followingits liberation in 1944, the short-livedFourth Republicwas established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in theAlgerian War. The currentFifth Republicwas formed in 1958 byCharles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retainingclose economic and military ties with France."
"France retains its centuries-long status as a global centreof art,science, andphilosophy.It hoststhethird-largestnumber ofUNESCOWorld Heritage Sitesand is the world'sleading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreignvisitors in 2018.[17]France is adeveloped countrywith ahigh nominal per capita income globallyandits advanced economyranks among thelargest in the world. It is agreat powerin global affairs,[18]being one of the fivepermanent members of the United Nations Security Counciland an officialnuclear-weapon state. France is a founding andleadingmember of the European Unionand theeurozone,[19]as well as a key member of theGroup of Seven,North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO),Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), andFrancophonie."
"Originally applied to the wholeFrankish Empire, the nameFrancecomes from theLatinFrancia, or ""realm of theFranks"".[20]Modern France is still named todayFranciain Italian and Spanish, whileFrankreichin German,Frankrijkin Dutch andFrankrikein Swedish and Norwegian all mean ""Land/realm of the Franks""."
"Thename of the Franksis related to the English wordfrank(""free""): the latter stems from theOld Frenchfranc(""free, noble, sincere""), ultimately fromMedieval Latinfrancus(""free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank""), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as aLate Latinborrowing of the reconstructedFrankishendonym*Frank.[21][22]It has been suggested that the meaning ""free"" was adopted because, after the conquest ofGaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[23]or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[22]"
"The etymology of*Frankis uncertain. It is traditionally derived from theProto-Germanicword*frankōn, which translates as ""javelin"" or ""lance"" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as thefrancisca),[24]although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[22]"
"In English, 'France' is pronounced/fræns/FRANSSin American English and/frɑːns/FRAHNSSor/fræns/FRANSSin British English. The pronunciation with/ɑː/is mostly confined to accents with thetrap-bath splitsuch asReceived Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such asCardiff English, in which/frɑːns/is in free variation with/fræns/.[25]"
"The oldest traces ofarchaic humansin what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[26]Neanderthalsoccupied the region intothe Upper Paleolithicera but were slowly replaced byHomo sapiensaround 35,000 BC.[27]This period witnessed the emergence ofcave paintingin theDordogneand thePyrenees, including at the famousLascauxsite, dated toc.18,000BC.[26]At the end of theLast Glacial Period(10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[26]from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered theNeolithicera, and its inhabitants becamesedentary."
"After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC,metallurgy appearedat the end of the 3rd millennium BC, initially working gold,copperandbronze, then lateriron.[28]France has numerousmegalithicsites from the Neolithic, including the exceptionally denseCarnac stonessite (approximately 3,300 BC)."
"In 600 BC,IonianGreeksfromPhocaeafounded thecolonyofMassalia(present-dayMarseille), on the shores of theMediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[29]At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[30]"
"Around 390 BC, the GallicchieftainBrennusand his troops made their way toRoman Italythrough theAlps, defeated the Romans in theBattle of the Allia, and besieged andransomedRome.[31]The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[32]But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[33]"
"Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this regionProvincia Nostra(""Our Province""), which over time evolved into the nameProvencein French.[34]Julius Caesarconquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftainVercingetorixin 52 BC.[35]Gaul was divided byAugustusinto Roman provinces.[36]Many cities were founded during theGallo-Roman period, includingLugdunum(present-dayLyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[36]"
"From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with itsfortified bordersbeing attacked on several occasions bybarbarians.[37]Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[38]In 312, EmperorConstantine Iconverted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians who had been persecuted increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[39]But from the beginning of the 5th century, theBarbarian Invasionsresumed.[40]Teutonictribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, theVisigothssettling in the southwest, theBurgundiansalong the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks in the north.[41]"
"At the end of theAntiquityperiod, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as theKingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously,Celtic Britons, fleeing theAnglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in the western part ofArmorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamedBrittany,Celtic culturewas revived, and independentpetty kingdomsarose in the region."
"The first leader to unite all Franks wasClovis I, who began his reign as king of theSalian Franksin 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptised a Christian in the event of his victory against theVisigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovisregained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptised in 508 and made himself master of what is now western Germany."
"Clovis I was the firstGermanicconqueror after thefall of the Roman Empireto convert to Catholic Christianity, rather thanArianism; thus France was given the title ""Eldest daughter of the Church"" (French:La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[42]and French kings would be called ""the Most Christian Kings of France"" (Rex Christianissimus)."
"The Franks embraced the ChristianGallo-Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was eventually renamedFrancia(""Land of the Franks""). The Germanic Franks adoptedRomanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and whereGermanic languagesemerged. Clovis madeParishis capital and established theMerovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris,Orléans,Soissons, andRheims. Thelast Merovingian kingslost powerto theirmayors of the palace(head of household). One mayor of the palace,Charles Martel, defeated anUmayyad invasion of Gaulat theBattle of Tours(732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son,Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded theCarolingian dynasty. Pepin's son,Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire acrossWesternandCentral Europe."
"ProclaimedHoly Roman EmperorbyPope Leo IIIand thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtimehistorical associationwith theCatholic Church,[43]Charlemagne tried to revive theWestern Roman Empireand its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son,Louis I(r. 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under theTreaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, withEast Franciagoing toLouis the German,Middle FranciatoLothair I, andWest FranciatoCharles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[44]"
"During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened byViking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was establishedfeudalismin France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after theBattle of Hastingsin 1066,William the Conqueroradded ""King of England"" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (asDuke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions."
"The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, whenHugh Capet,Duke of FranceandCount of Paris, was crownedking of the Franks.[45]This date is often used as the transtition betweenWest Franciaand theKingdom of France. His descendants—thedirect Capetians, theHouse of Valoisand theHouse of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance. Starting from 1190, during the reign ofPhilip II, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as ""kings of France"" (rex Francie) rather than ""kings of the Franks"" (rex Francorum).[46]Later kings would expand their directly possesseddomaine royalto cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on ahierarchically conceived societydistinguishingnobility, clergy, andcommoners."
"The French nobility played a prominent role in mostCrusadesto restore Christian access to theHoly Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the 200-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders asFranjcaring little whether they came from France.[47]The French Crusaders also imported the French language into theLevant, makingFrenchthe base of thelingua franca(lit. ""Frankish language"") of theCrusader states.[47]French knights also made up the majority in both theHospitaland theTemple orders. The latter in particular held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, untilPhilip IVannihilated the order in 1307. TheAlbigensian Crusadewas launched in 1209 to eliminate the hereticalCatharsin the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomousCounty of Toulousewas annexed into thecrown lands of France.[48]"
"From the 11th century, theHouse of Plantagenet, the rulers of theCounty of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces ofMaineandTouraine, then progressively built an ""empire"" that spanned from England to thePyreneesand covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and thePlantagenet empirewould last a hundred years, untilPhilip II of Franceconquered, between 1202 and 1214, most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England andAquitaineto the Plantagenets."
"Charles IV the Fairdied without an heir in 1328.[49]UnderSalic lawthe crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[49]Accordingly, the crown passed toPhilip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon becomeEdward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[49]However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-onHundred Years' War.[50]The boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such asJoan of ArcandLa Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by theBlack Death, from which half of the 17 million population of France died.[51]"
"TheFrench Renaissancesaw spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become theofficial language of Franceand the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as theItalian Wars, between France and theHouse of Habsburg. French explorers such asJacques CartierandSamuel de Champlainclaimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of theFrench colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as theFrench Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands ofHuguenotswere murdered in theSt. Bartholomew's Day massacreof 1572.[52]Events such as this forced many Huguenots to flee to neighbouring Protestant regions such as theBritish Isles(especiallyto the Kentish coast), theHoly Roman Empire,Switzerland, and more. The Wars of Religion were ended byHenry IV'sEdict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.Spanishtroops, the terror of Western Europe,[53]assisted the Catholic side from 1589 to 1594 and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659.The warcost France 300,000 casualties.[54]"
"UnderLouis XIII,Cardinal Richelieupromoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (duelling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established ""the royal monopoly of force"" as the doctrine.[55]"
"From the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for 11% of thetransatlantic slave trade,[56]second only to Great Britain during the 18th century.[57]While the state began condoning the practice withletters patentin the 1630s, Louis XIII only formalized this authorization more generally in 1642 in the last year of his reign. By the mid-18th century,Nanteshad become the principalFrench slave-trading port.[56]"
"DuringLouis XIV's minority and the regency ofQueen AnneandCardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as theFrondeoccurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords andsovereign courtsas a reaction to therise of royal absolute powerin France. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords intocourtiersat thePalace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. Remembered for numerous wars, the so-called ""Sun King"" made France the leading European power. France became themost populous country in Europeand had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[58]During his reign, France took colonial control of many overseas territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIVrevoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published theCode Noirproviding the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jewish people from the French colonies.[59]"
"Under the wars ofLouis XV(r. 1715–1774), France lostNew Franceand most of itsIndian possessionsafter its defeat in theSeven Years' War(1756–1763). ItsEuropean territorykept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such asLorraine(1766) andCorsica(1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions—as well as the decadence of his court—discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for theFrench Revolution15 years after his death.[60]"
"Louis XVI(r. 1774–1793)actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them winindependence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Some of theEnlightenmentoccurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as thenaming of oxygen(1778) and the firsthot air balloon carrying passengers(1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such asBougainvilleandLapérouse, took part in thevoyages of scientific explorationthrough maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in whichreasonis advocated as the primary source oflegitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution."
"Facing financial troubles, Louis XVI summoned theEstates-General(gathering the threeEstates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of theThird Estateformed aNational Assembly, signalling the outbreak of theFrench Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgentsstormed the Bastilleon 14 July 1789, a date which would becomeFrance's National Day."
"In early August 1789, theNational Constituent Assemblyabolished the privilegesof thenobilitysuch as personalserfdomand exclusive hunting rights. Through theDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen(27 August 1789), France established fundamental rights for men. The declaration affirms ""the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"" to ""liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression"".Freedom of speechandpresswere declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, aCivil Constitution of the Clergyreorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrousflight to Varennesin June 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that theabolition of the monarchyand the establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility."
"In the August 1791Declaration of Pillnitz, the Emperor ofAustriaand the King ofPrussiathreatened to restore the French monarch by force. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced Louis XVI to accept theFrench Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into aconstitutional monarchy. In the newly establishedLegislative Assembly(October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the 'Girondins', who favoured war withAustriaandPrussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that such a war could be won and sodeclared war on Austriaon 20 April 1792."
"On 10 August 1792, an angry crowdthreatened the palace of Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[61][62]A Prussian army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France,murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisonersby raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and theParis City Councilseemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[61][63]TheNational Convention, chosen in the first elections under maleuniversal suffrage,[61]on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming theFrench First Republic. Louis XVIwas convicted of treasonandguillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a ""sister republic"" in the ""Republic of Mainz"" and kept it under control."
"Also in March 1793, acounter-revolution in Vendéebegan, evoked by both theCivil Constitution of the Clergyof 1790 and the nationwide army conscription in early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smouldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax on 2 June 1793 with the group of the Girondins being forced to resign and leave the convention. By July the counter-revolution had spread toBrittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Between October and December 1793, Paris' Convention government took brutal measures to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[64]By the end of 1793, the allies had been driven from France."
"Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were prospering, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and royalism."
"GeneralNapoleonBonaparteseized control of the Republicin 1799 becomingFirst Consuland laterEmperorof theFrench Empire(1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars, changing sets ofEuropean coalitionsdeclaredwars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as thebattles of Jena-AuerstadtandAusterlitz. Members of theBonapartefamily were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[66]"
"These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as themetric system, theNapoleonic Codeand the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812 Napoleonattacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign and the ensuinguprising of European monarchiesagainst his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmendied during the Napoleonic Wars.[66]After hisbrief returnfrom exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at theBattle of Waterloo, and theBourbon monarchy was restoredwith new constitutional limitations."
"The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by theJuly Revolutionof 1830, which established the constitutionalJuly Monarchy. In that year, French troops began theconquest of Algeria. In 1848, general unrest led to theFebruary Revolutionand the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic,Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of theSecond Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially inCrimea,MexicoandItalywhich resulted in the annexation of theDuchy of Savoyand theCounty of Nice, then part of theKingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in theFranco-Prussian Warof 1870, and his regime was replaced by theThird Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.[67]"
"France hadcolonial possessions, in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries itsglobal overseas colonial empireextended greatly and became the second-largest in the world behind theBritish Empire.[15]Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under Frenchsovereigntyreached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as theBelle Époque, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905,state secularismwasofficially established."
"France wasinvaded by Germany and defended by Great Britainto start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and theAlliesemerged victorious against theCentral Powersat a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[68]Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[69]The interbellum years were marked byintense international tensionsand a variety of social reforms introduced by thePopular Front government(e.g.,annual leave,eight-hour workdays,women in government)."
"In 1940, France wasinvaded and quickly defeatedbyNazi Germany. France was divided into aGerman occupation zonein the north, anItalian occupation zonein the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire (includingFrench Tunisia,French Morocco, andFrench Algeria); theVichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory.Free France, the government-in-exile led byCharles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[70]"
"From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around75,000 Jews,[71]were deported todeath campsandconcentration campsin Germany andoccupied Poland.[72]In September 1943,Corsicawas the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from theAxis powers. On 6 June 1944, theAlliesinvaded Normandy, and in August theyinvaded Provence. Over the following year, the Allies and theFrench Resistanceemerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of theProvisional Government of the French Republic(GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue towage war against Germanyand topurge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (e.g., suffrage extended to women and the creation of asocial securitysystem)."
"The GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in theFourth Republic(1946–1958), which saw spectacular economic growth (lesTrente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members ofNATO. France attempted toregain control of French Indochinabut was defeated by theViet Minhin 1954 at the climacticBattle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced anotheranti-colonialistconflict in Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers (Pied-Noir). During the conflict, the French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control of Algeria.[73]This conflict wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in France.[74]"
"During theMay 1958 crisis, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to theFifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency.[75]In the latter role, de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with theÉvian Accordsin 1962 which led toAlgerian independence. Algerian independence came at a high price: it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[76]Around one million Pied-Noirs andHarkisfled from Algeria to France upon independence.[77]A vestige of the colonial empire are theFrench overseas departments and territories."
"In the context of theCold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of ""national independence"" towards theWesternandEastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the NATO alliance), launched anuclear development programmeand made France thefourth nuclear power. HerestoredcordialFranco-German relationsto create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of asupranational Europe, favouring a Europe ofsovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwideprotests of 1968, therevolt of May 1968had an enormous social impact. It was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as theGaullistparty emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle, who resigned shortly after.[78]"
"In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developedeconomies in the worldbut faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranationalEuropean Union, notably by signing theMaastricht Treaty(which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing theeurozonein 1999 and signing theTreaty of Lisbonin 2007.[79]France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.[80]"
"Since the 19th century, France hasreceived many immigrants. These have been mostly maleforeign workersfrom European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[81]During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from theMaghreb)[81]to permanentlysettle in France with their familiesand acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[82]Simultaneously France renounced theassimilationof immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely tointegrate.[83]"
"Since the1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably theCharlie Hebdoattackin January 2015 which provoked thelargest public ralliesin French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[84]theNovember 2015 Paris attackswhich resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[85]and the deadliest in the European Union since theMadrid train bombings in 2004,[86]as well as the2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths duringBastille Daycelebrations.Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to containISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[87]"
"The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is calledMetropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by theNorth Seain the north, theEnglish Channelin the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist ofBelgiumandLuxembourgin the northeast,GermanyandSwitzerlandin the east,ItalyandMonacoin the southeast, andAndorraandSpainin the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to asl'Hexagone(""TheHexagon""). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest isCorsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes41°and51° N, and longitudes6° Wand10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northerntemperatezone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west."
"Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[88]the largest amongEuropean Unionmembers.[19]France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excludingAdélie Land), is 643,801 km2(248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of theAlpsin the southeast, theMassif Centralin the south-central andPyreneesin the southwest."
"Due to its numerousoverseas departments and territoriesscattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largestexclusive economic zone(EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2(4,261,000 sq mi), just behind the EEZ of theUnited States, which covers 11,351,000 km2(4,383,000 sq mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2(3,146,000 sq mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world."
"Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which theArmorican Massif, theMassif Central, theMorvan, theVosgesandArdennesranges and the island ofCorsicawere formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[89]above sea level,Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate."
"The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along theFrench Riviera, coastal cliffs such as theCôte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in theLanguedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major riversSeine, theLoire, theGaronne, theRhôneand their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at theCamargue. The Garonne meets theDordognejust after Bordeaux, forming theGironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90]Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10^6sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas."
"France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[91]Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is rankedonly 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment innuclear powerfollowing the1973 oil crisis,[92]which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production[93]and results in less pollution.[94][95]According to the 2020Environmental Performance Indexconducted byYaleandColumbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world (behind the United Kingdom).[96][97]"
"Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cutcarbon emissionsby at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020,[98]compared to the United States' plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[99]As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China.[100]The country was set to impose acarbon taxin 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[101]which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[102]However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[103]"
"Forests account for 31 per cent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[104][105][106]French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[107]France had a 2018Forest Landscape Integrity Indexmean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[108]There are ninenational parks[109]and 46natural parksin France,[110]with the government planning to convert 20% ofits exclusive economic zoneinto aMarine protected areaby 2020.[111]A regional nature park[112](French:parc naturel régionalor PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and thenational governmentcovering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[113]A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences.[114]As of 2019[update]there are 54 PNRs in France.[115]"
"The French Republic is divided into 18regions(located in Europe and overseas), fiveoverseas collectivities, oneoverseas territory, one special collectivity –New Caledoniaand one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France –Clipperton."
"Since 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions inmetropolitan France(includingCorsica),[116]and fiveoverseas.[88]The regions are further subdivided into 101departments,[117]which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used onvehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe,Martinique,Mayotte, andRéunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union."
"The 101 departments are subdivided into 335arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054cantons.[118]These cantons are then divided into 36,658communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[118]Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45municipal arrondissements."
"In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has fiveoverseas collectivities(French Polynesia,Saint Barthélemy,Saint Martin,Saint Pierre and Miquelon, andWallis and Futuna), onesui generiscollectivity (New Caledonia), oneoverseas territory(French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use theCFP franc[119]whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[120]"
"France is arepresentative democracyorganised as aunitary,semi-presidentialrepublic.[121]As one of the earliest republics of the modern world, democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.[122]The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved byreferendumon 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.[123]It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[122]"
"The executive branch has two leaders. ThePresident of the Republic, currentlyEmmanuel Macron, is thehead of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[124]ThePrime Minister, currentlyGabriel Attal, is thehead of government, appointed by the President to lead thegovernment. The President has the power to dissolve Parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the President also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, as well as serves as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Prime Minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[125]In the2022 presidential election, president Macron was re-elected.[126]2 months later, in theJune 2022 legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form aminority government.[127]"
"The legislature consists of theFrench Parliament, abicameralbody made up of alower house, theNational Assembly(Assemblée nationale) and anupper house, theSenate.[128]Legislators in the National Assembly, known asdéputés, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[129]The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[130]The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[131]The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws."
"Until World War II,Radicalswere a strong political force in France, embodied by theRepublican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Partywhich was the most important party of the Third Republic. From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, theFrench Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by theSocialist Party(in 1969); and the other right-wing, theGaullist Party, whose name changed over time to theRally of the French People(1947), theUnion of Democrats for the Republic(1958), theRally for the Republic(1976), theUnion for a Popular Movement(2007) andThe Republicans(since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, theradical centristpartyLa République En Marche!(LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right partyNational Rally(RN). Since 2020,Europe Ecology – The Greens(EELV) have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities[132]while on a national level, an alliance of Left parties (theNUPES) was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.[133]Additionally,right-wing populistRN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.[134]"
"The electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[135]"
"France uses acivil legalsystem, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[88]judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent tocase lawin acommon lawsystem). Basic principles of therule of lawwere laid in theNapoleonic Code(which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified underLouis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. AsGuy Canivet, first president of theCourt of Cassationwrote about the management of prisons: ""Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality."" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy."
"French law is divided into two principal areas:private lawandpublic law. Private law includes, in particular,civil lawandcriminal law. Public law includes, in particular,administrative lawandconstitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminalex post factolaws are prohibited).[136]While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court:ordinary courts(which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by theCourt of Cassationand administrative courts are headed by theCouncil of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in theJournal officiel de la République française."
"France does not recognisereligious lawas a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolishedblasphemylaws andsodomy laws(the latter in 1791). However, ""offences againstpublic decency"" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) ordisturbing public order(trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution."
"France generally has a positive reputation regardingLGBT rights.[137]Since 1999,civil unionsfor homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013,same-sex marriageandLGBT adoptionare legal.[138]Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press areas old as 1881. Some considerhate speech laws in Franceto be too broad or severe, underminingfreedom of speech.[139]France has laws against racism andantisemitism,[140]while the 1990Gayssot ActprohibitsHolocaust denial. In 2024, France became the first nation in the European Union to explicitly protectabortionin itsconstitution.[141]"
"Freedom of religionis constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the Stateis the basis forlaïcité(state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion,except in Alsace-Moselle, which was part of Germany in 1905, and continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament haslisted many religious movements as dangerous cultssince 1995 and hasbanned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schoolssince 2004. In 2010, it banned thewearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such asAmnesty InternationalandHuman Rights Watchdescribed the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[142][143]However, it is supported by most of the population.[144]"
"France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of thepermanent members of the UN Security Councilwith veto rights.[145]In 2015, it was described as ""the best networked state in the world"" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[146]these include the G7,World Trade Organization(WTO),[147]thePacific Community(SPC)[148]and theIndian Ocean Commission(COI).[149]It is an associate member of theAssociation of Caribbean States(ACS)[150]and a leading member of theOrganisation internationale de la Francophonie(OIF) of 84 French-speaking countries.[151]"
"As a significant hub for international relations, France has thethird-largest assemblyofdiplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States, which are far more populous. It also hosts the headquarters of severalinternational organisations, including theOECD,UNESCO,Interpol, theInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[154]"
"French foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was afounding member. Since the1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become themost influential driving force of the EU.[155]In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[156]seeking to build its standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an ""Entente cordiale"" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especiallymilitarily."
"France is a member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of theSpecial Relationshipbetween the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[157][158][159]"
"France retains strong political and economic influence in itsformer African colonies(Françafrique)[160]and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[161]From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of theMaliangovernment in theNorthern Mali conflict."
"In 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor ofdevelopment aidin absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[162]This represents 0.43% of itsGNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[163]Aid is provided by the governmentalFrench Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects insub-Saharan Africa,[164]with an emphasis on ""developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy"".[164]"
"The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under thePresident of the Republicas supreme commander. They consist of theFrench Army(Armée de Terre), theFrench Navy(Marine Nationale, formerly calledArmée de Mer), theFrench Air and Space Force(Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace), and theNational Gendarmerie(Gendarmerie nationale), which serves as bothmilitary policeand civil police in rural areas. Together they are among thelargest armed forcesin the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study byCrédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as theworld's sixth-most powerful military, and the second most powerful in Europe afterRussia.[165]France's annual military expenditure in 2022 was US$53.6 billion, or 1.9%of its GDP, making it theeighth biggest military spender in the world.[166]There has been no nationalconscriptionsince 1997.[167]"
"France has been arecognised nuclear statesince 1960. It is a party to both theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT)[168]and theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force (formerly known as ""Force de Frappe"") consists of fourTriomphantclass submarines equipped withsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60ASMPmedium-rangeair-to-ground missileswithnuclear warheads;[169]50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using theMirage 2000Nlong-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy'sSuper Étendard Modernisé(SEM)attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-poweredaircraft carrierCharles de Gaulle."
"France has major military industries and one of the largestaerospace sectorsin the world.[170]The country has produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, theCharles de Gaulleaircraft carrier, theExocetmissile and theLeclerctank among others. France is a major arms seller,[171][172]with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices."
"One French intelligence unit, theDirectorate-General for External Security(Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure), is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction générale de la Police Nationale).[citation needed]France'scybersecurity capabilitiesare regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world.[173][174]"
"French weapons exported totaled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year 2021. Additionally, the UAE alone contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total.[175]Among the largest French defence companies areDassault,ThalesandSafran.[176]"
"France has amixed market economy, characterised bysizeable government involvement, andeconomic diversity. For roughly two centuries, the French economy hasconsistently rankedamong the ten largest globally; it is currently the world'sninth-largestbypurchasing power parity, theseventh-largestbynominal GDP, and the second-largest in the European Union by both metrics.[178]France is considered aneconomic power, with membership in theGroup of Sevenleadingindustrialised countries, theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), and theGroup of Twentylargest economies."
"France's economy is highly diversified;servicesrepresent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,[179]while theindustrial sectoraccounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by share of global manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent.[180]Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by theprimary sector, namely agriculture;[181]however, France's agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in terms of overall production.[182]"
"In 2018, France was the fifth-largest trading nation in the world and the second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[183]Its membership in theeurozoneand the broaderEuropean single marketfacilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.[184]Despiteprotectionistpolicies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[185][186]In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world inforeign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[187]According to theBank of France(founded in 1800),[188]the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance.[189]TheParis Regionhas the highest concentration of multinational firms in Europe.[189]"
"Under the doctrine ofDirigisme, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such asindicative planningandnationalisationare credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known asTrente Glorieuses. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned; state ownership now dominates only transportation, defence and broadcasting.[190]Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 mostinnovativecountries in the 2020Bloomberg Innovation Index,[191]and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019Global Competitiveness Report(up two places from 2018).[192]"

Some examples of the most valuable French companies includeLVMH,L'OréalandSociéte Générale.[195]"
"France has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a ""global agricultural powerhouse""; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[196][197]Nicknamed ""the granary of the old continent"",[198]over half its total land area isfarmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, andEU subsidieshave made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[199]"
"With 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[200]France is the world'stop tourist destination, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). However, it ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits.[201]The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors):Eiffel Tower(6.2 million),Château de Versailles(2.8 million),Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle(2 million),Pont du Gard(1.5 million),Arc de Triomphe(1.2 million),Mont Saint-Michel(1 million),Sainte-Chapelle(683,000),Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg(549,000),Puy de Dôme(500,000),Musée Picasso(441,000), andCarcassonne(362,000).[202]"

TheChâteau de Chantilly,VersaillesandVaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions."
"France has 52 sites inscribed inUNESCO's World Heritage Listand features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the associationLes Plus Beaux Villages de France(literally ""The Most Beautiful Villages of France""). The ""Remarkable Gardens"" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by theMinistry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religiouspilgrimson theirway to St. James, or toLourdes, a town in theHautes-Pyrénéesthat hosts several million visitors a year."
"France is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.[208]Électricité de France(EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity, and one of the world's largestelectric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally.[209]In 2018, EDF produced around one-fifth of theEuropean Union's electricity, primarily fromnuclear power.[210]As of 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the U.K. and Italy,[211]and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.[211]"
"Since the1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy ofenergy security,[211]namely throughheavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries withnuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by thenumber of operational nuclear reactors, at 56.[212]Consequently, 70% of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;[213]only Slovakia and Ukraine derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.[214]France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.[211]"
"Due to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power,renewable energieshave seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, France's production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.[215]Hydropoweris by far the leading source, accounting for over half the country's renewable energy sources[216]and contributing 13% of its electricity,[215]the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey.[216]As with nuclear power, most hydroelectric plants, such asEguzon,Étang de Soulcem, andLac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF.[216]France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040.[215]"
"France'srailway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008,[218]is the second most extensive in Western Europe afterGermany.[219]It is operated by theSNCF, and high-speed trains include theThalys, theEurostarandTGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[220]The Eurostar, along with theEurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through theChannel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities havingundergroundor tramway services complementing bus services."
"There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[221]The Paris Region is enveloped with the densest network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee orroad tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such asRenault,PeugeotandCitroën.[222]France possesses theMillau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[223]and has built many important bridges such as thePont de Normandie.Dieselandpetrol-driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country'sair pollutionandgreenhouse gas emissions.[224][225]"
"There are 464airportsin France.[88]Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world.Air Franceis the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is inMarseille,[226]which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[227]12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including theCanal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through theGaronneriver.[88]"
"Since theMiddle Ages, France has contributed to scientific and technological achievement. In the early 11th century, the French-bornPope Sylvester IIreintroduced theabacusandarmillary sphereand introducedArabic numeralsandclocksto much of Europe.[229]TheUniversity of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the Western world.[230]In the 17th century, mathematician and philosopherRené Descartespioneeredrationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, whileBlaise Pascalbecame famous for his work onprobabilityandfluid mechanics; both were key figures of theScientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. TheFrench Academy of Sciences, founded in the mid-17th century byLouis XIVto encourage and protect Frenchscientific research, was one of the earliestnational scientific institutionsin history."
"TheAge of Enlightenmentwas marked by the work of biologistBuffon, one of the first naturalists to recognizeecological succession, and chemistLavoisier, who discovered the role ofoxygenincombustion.DiderotandD'Alembertpublished theEncyclopédie, which aimed to give the public access to ""useful knowledge"" that could be applied to everyday life.[231]TheIndustrial Revolutionof the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France, withAugustin Fresnelfounding modernoptics,Sadi Carnotlaying the foundations ofthermodynamics, andLouis Pasteurpioneeringmicrobiology. Other eminent French scientists of the period have theirnames inscribed on the Eiffel Tower."
"Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicistHenri Poincaré; physicistsHenri Becquerel,PierreandMarie Curie, who remain famous for their work onradioactivity; physicistPaul Langevin; and virologistLuc Montagnier, co-discoverer ofHIV AIDS.Hand transplantationwas developed inLyonin 1998 by an international team that includedJean-Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant.[232]Telesurgerywasfirst performedby French surgeons led byJacques Marescauxon 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean.[233]Aface transplantwas first done on 27 November 2005 byBernard Devauchelle.[234][235]France ranked 11th in the 2023Global Innovation Index, compared to 16th in 2019.[236][237][238][239]"
"With an estimated January 2024 population of 68,373,433 people,[8]France is the20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (afterRussiaandGermany), and the second most populous in theEuropean Union(after Germany)."
"France is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate ofnatural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[240]Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[241]This was the highest rate since the end of thebaby boomin 1973 and coincides with the rise of thetotal fertility ratefrom a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010."
"As of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below thereplacement rateof 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[242][243][244][245]France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the Frenchpopulation is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[246]Thelife expectancyat birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world."
"From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 per cent per year;[247]since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent annually.[248]Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 per cent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least oneforeign-bornparent and another 24 per cent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[249]"
"Historically,French peoplewere mainly ofCeltic-Gallicorigin, with a significant admixture ofItalic(Romans) andGermanic(Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[250]Through the course of theMiddle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced byBretonelements in the west,Aquitanianin the southwest,Scandinavianin the northwest,Alemannicin the northeast, andLigurianin the southeast."
"Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in theFrench Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, theInstitut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[251][252]"
"A 2008 poll conducted jointly bythe Institut national d'études démographiquesandthe French National Institute of Statistics[253][254]estimated that the largest ancestry groups wereItalian(5 million), followed byNorthwest African(3–6 million),[255][256][257]Sub-Saharan African(2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[258]There are also sizeable minorities of otherEuropean ethnic groups, namelySpanish,Portuguese,Polish, andGreek.[255][259][260]France has a significantGitan (Romani)population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[261]many foreignRomaareexpelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[262]"
"It is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[263]between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[264]The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 millionpieds noirsreturned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[265][266]They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal."
"France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[267]In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient ofasylumseekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).[268]In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world.[269]In subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[270]The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curbEastern Europeanmigration.[citation needed]Foreigners' rights are established in theCode of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right to Asylum. Immigration remains a contentious political issue.[271]"
"In 2008, theINSEE(National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million ofMaghrebiancestry.[272][273][274]In 2008, France grantedcitizenshipto 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[275]"
"In 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the institute, this increase resulted from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period.[276]Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000.[276]Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italian, 4% German, 3% Romanian, and 3% Belgian.[276]"
"France is a highly urbanised country, with itslargest cities(in terms ofmetropolitan areapopulation in 2019[277]) being Paris (13,114,718 inh.),Lyon(2,280,845),Marseille(1,873,270),Lille(1,510,079),Toulouse(1,454,158),Bordeaux(1,363,711),Nantes(1,011,020),Strasbourg(853,110),Montpellier(801,595), andRennes(755,668). (Note: since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders,INSEEconsiders thatNiceis a metropolitan area separate from theCannes-Antibesmetropolitan area; these two combined would have a population of 1,008,296, as of the 2019 census).Rural flightwas a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century."
"The official language of France is French,[278]aRomance languagederived fromLatin. Since 1635, theAcadémie françaisehas been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such asOccitan,Breton,Catalan,Flemish(Dutchdialect),Alsatian(German dialect),Basque, andCorsican(Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[279]"
"The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as theOrganisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat fromanglicisationhas prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the Frenchoverseas territories. It is estimated that between 300 million[280]and 500 million[281]people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or as a second language."
"According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by theEuropean Unionand carried out in France by theINSEEand based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[282]"
"France is a secular country in whichfreedom of religionis a constitutional right. The French policy on religion is based on the concept oflaïcité, a strictseparation of church and stateunder which the government and public life are kept completely secular, detached from any religion. The region ofAlsaceandMoselleis an exception to the general French norm, since thelocal lawstipulates official status and state funding forLutheranism,CatholicismandJudaism. According to the national survey of 2020 holden by theINSEE, 34% of the French population adhered toChristianity, of whom 25% were Catholics and 9% other Christians (without further specification); at the same time, 11% of the French population adhered toIslam, 0.5% toBuddhism,  0.5% to Judaism, and 1.0% to other religions.[4]53% of the population declared that they had no religion.[4]"
"Catholicism was the main religion in France for more than a millennium, and it was once the country'sstate religion. Its role nowadays, however, has been greatly reduced, although, as of 2012, among the 47,000 religious buildings in France 94% were still Catholic churches.[283]During theFrench Revolution, activists conducted a brutalcampaign of de-Christianisation, which put an end to the role of the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases, clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the aforementioned principle oflaïcité.[284]"
"To this day, the government is prohibited from recognising specific rights to any religious community (with the exception of legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the aforementioned local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine, and religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.[285]Some religious groups, such asScientology, theChildren of God, theUnification Church, and theOrder of the Solar Temple, are consideredcults(sectesin French, which is considered a pejorative term[286]) in France, and therefore they are not granted the same status as recognised religions.[287]"
"TheFrench health care systemis one ofuniversal health carelargely financed by governmentnational health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, theWorld Health Organizationfound that France provided the ""close to best overall health care"" in the world.[289]The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[290][291]In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[292]a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe butless than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government-funded agencies.[293]"
"Care is generally free for people affected bychronic diseases(affections de longues durées) such as cancer, AIDS orcystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest in the European Union and the World.[294][295]There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[296]and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[297]As of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[88]"
"In 1802,Napoleoncreated thelycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[299]Nevertheless,Jules Ferryis considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[300][301]"
"French education is centralised and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. TheProgramme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by theOECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018.[302][303]France was one of the PISA-participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers.[303]Schoolchildren in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to otherOECDcountries.[303]"
"Higher education is divided betweenpublic universitiesand the prestigious and selectiveGrandes écoles, such asSciences Po Parisfor Political studies,HEC Parisfor Economics,Polytechnique, theÉcole des hautes études en sciences socialesfor Social studies and theÉcole nationale supérieure des mines de Paristhat produce high-profile engineers, or theÉcole nationale d'administrationfor careers in theGrands Corpsof the state. TheGrandes écoleshave been criticised for allegedelitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians.[304]"
"The origins of French art were very much influenced byFlemish artand byItalian artat the time of theRenaissance.Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance paintingSchool of Fontainebleauwas directly inspired by Italian painters such asPrimaticcioandRosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of theBaroque era,Nicolas PoussinandClaude Lorrain, lived in Italy."
"French artists developed therococostyle in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artistsAntoine Watteau,François BoucherandJean-Honoré Fragonardbeing the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, asNapoleonfavoured artists ofneoclassic stylesuch asJacques-Louis Davidand the highly influentialAcadémie des Beaux-Artsdefined the style known asAcademism."
"In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such asImpressionismandSymbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period wereCamille Pissarro,Édouard Manet,Edgar Degas,Claude MonetandAuguste Renoir.[305]The second generation of impressionist-style painters,Paul Cézanne,Paul Gauguin,Toulouse-LautrecandGeorges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[306]as well as thefauvistartistsHenri Matisse,André DerainandMaurice de Vlaminck.[307][308]"
"At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed byGeorges Braqueand the Spanish painterPablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such asVincent van Gogh,Marc Chagall,Amedeo ModiglianiandWassily Kandinsky."
"There are many art museums in France, the most famous of which being the state-ownedMusée du Louvre, which collects artwork from the 18th century and earlier. TheMusée d'Orsaywas inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway stationGare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[309][310]It was voted the best museum in the world in 2018.[311]Modern works are presented in theMusée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to theCentre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums are visited by close to 17 million people a year.[312]"
"During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived areChinon,Château d'Angers, the massiveChâteau de Vincennesand the so-calledCathar castles. During this era, France had been usingRomanesque architecturelike most of Western Europe."
"Gothic architecture, originally namedOpus Francigenummeaning ""French work"",[313]was born inÎle-de-Franceand was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.[314]Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being theSaint Denis Basilica(used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals areNotre-Dame de ChartresandNotre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church:Notre-Dame de Reims.[315]"
"The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of theFrench Renaissanceand several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in theLoire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference theChâteau de Montsoreau.[316]Examples of such residential castles include theChâteau de Chambord, theChâteau de Chenonceau, or theChâteau d'Amboise."
"Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages,Baroque architecturereplaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.[317]In the secular domain, thePalace of Versailleshas many baroque features.Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome atLes Invalides.[318]Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such asPlace StanislasinNancy. On the military architectural side,Vaubandesigned some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[319][320]"
"After the Revolution, theRepublicansfavouredNeoclassicismalthough it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as theParisian Pantheonor theCapitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, theArc de TriompheandSainte Marie-Madeleinerepresent the best example ofEmpire-stylearchitecture.[321]UnderNapoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroquePalais Garnierwere built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably,Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is namedSecond Empirein English, the term being taken from theSecond French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect wasEugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century,Gustave Eiffeldesigned many bridges, such as theGarabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for theEiffel Tower."
"In the 20th century, French-Swiss architectLe Corbusierdesigned several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. TheLouvre Pyramidis an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[322]France's largest financial district isLa Défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[323]Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is theMillau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects includeJean Nouvel,Dominique Perrault,Christian de PortzamparcandPaul Andreu."
"The earliest French literature dates from theMiddle Ageswhen what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts, such asTristan and IseultandLancelot-Grailare unknown. Three famous medieval authors areChrétien de Troyes,Christine de Pizan(langue d'oïl), andDuke William IX of Aquitaine(langue d'oc). Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of theCarolingian cycle, such asThe Song of Rolandand the variouschansons de geste. TheRoman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval characterReynard('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer wasFrançois Rabelais, who wrote five popular earlypicaresquenovels. Rabelais was also in regular communication withMarguerite de Navarre, author of theHeptameron.[324]Another 16th-century author wasMichel de Montaigne, whose most famous work,Essais, started a literary genre.[325]"
"French literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries.Denis Diderot's best-known works areJacques the FatalistandRameau's Nephew. He is best known, however, as the main editor of theEncyclopédie, whose aim was, to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to fight ignorance andobscurantism. During that same century,Charles Perraultwas a prolific writer of children's fairy tales includingPuss in Boots,Cinderella,Sleeping BeautyandBluebeard. At the start of the 19th century,symbolist poetrywas an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire,Paul VerlaineandStéphane Mallarmé.[326]"
"The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as ""the greatest French writer of all time""[327]for excelling in allliterary genres. The preface of his playCromwellis considered to be the manifesto of theRomantic movement.Les ContemplationsandLa Légende des sièclesare considered ""poetic masterpieces"",[328]Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare,DanteandHomer.[328]His novelLes Misérablesis widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written[329]andThe Hunchback of Notre Damehas remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century includeAlexandre Dumas(The Three MusketeersandThe Count of Monte-Cristo),Jules Verne(Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea),Émile Zola(Les Rougon-Macquart),Honoré de Balzac(La Comédie humaine),Guy de Maupassant,Théophile GautierandStendhal(The Red and the Black,The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world."
"In the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.[330]Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[330]The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[330]Important writers of the 20th century includeMarcel Proust,Louis-Ferdinand Céline,Jean Cocteau,Albert Camus, andJean-Paul Sartre.Antoine de Saint ExupérywroteThe Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades and is one of the best selling books in history.[331][332]"
"Medieval philosophy was dominated byScholasticismuntil the emergence ofHumanismin the Renaissance.Modern philosophybegan in France in the 17th century with the philosophy ofRené Descartes,Blaise PascalandNicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the firstWestern philosophersince ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.[333][334]France in the 18th Century saw major philipshocial contributions fromVoltairewho came to embody the Enlightenment andJean-Jacques Rousseauwhose work highly influenced the French Revolution.[335][336]French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including theexistentialistworks ofSimone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre.[337]Other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works ofSimone Weil, contributions tostructuralismincluding fromClaude Lévi-Straussand thepost-structuralistworks byMichel Foucault.[338][339]"
"France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period includeMarc-Antoine Charpentier,François Couperin,Michel-Richard Delalande,Jean-Baptiste LullyandMarin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the ""Roi Soleil"", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music ofJean-Philippe Rameaureached some prestige, and he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer ofFrench operaand the leading French composer of the harpsichord.[340]"
"Erik Satiewas a key member of the early-20th-century Parisianavant-garde.Francis Poulenc's best-known works are his piano suiteTrois mouvements perpétuels(1919), the balletLes biches(1923), theConcert champêtre(1928) forharpsichordand orchestra, the operaDialogues des Carmélites(1957) and theGloria(1959) forsoprano, choir and orchestra.Maurice RavelandClaude Debussyare the most prominent figures associated withImpressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales andchromaticisminfluenced many composers who followed.[341]Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage ofatonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[342][343][344][345]and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such asJeux d'eau,Miroirs,Le tombeau de CouperinandGaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in theRapsodie espagnole,Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement ofModest Mussorgsky'sPictures at an Exhibitionand his orchestral workBoléro(1928). More recently, in the middle of the 20th century,Maurice Ohana,Pierre SchaefferandPierre Boulezcontributed to the evolution ofcontemporary classical music.[346]"
"French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country,French pop music, known aschanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century areÉdith Piaf,Georges Brassens,Léo Ferré,Charles AznavourandSerge Gainsbourg.[347]Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[348]bands such asNoir Désir,Mano Negra,Niagara,Les Rita Mitsoukoand more recentlySuperbus,PhoenixandGojira,[349]orShaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity."
"France has historical and strong links withcinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as theLumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[353]The world's first female filmmaker,Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[354]Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960sNouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by theGovernment of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update]producing more films than any other European country.[355][356]The nation also hosts theCannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[357][358]"
"Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski,Krzysztof Kieślowski,Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé,Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff,Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani,Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such asLuc Besson,Jacques TourneurorFrancis Veberin theUnited States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[359]French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[359]In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.[360]"
"As part of its advocacy ofcultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,[361]France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[362]Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote byUNESCOin 2005: the principle of ""cultural exception"" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it.[363]"
"Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern ""haute couture"" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world'sfashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expressionHaute coutureis, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards."
"The association of France with fashion and style (French:la mode) dates largely to the reign ofLouis XIV[364]when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French:coutureorhaute couture) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the greatcouturierhouses such asChanel,Dior, andGivenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town ofGrasse.[365]"
"According to 2017 data compiled byDeloitte,Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey(LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[366]Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH,Kering SA,L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[366]"
"In 2021, regional daily newspapers (likeOuest-France,Sud Ouest,La Voix du Nord,Dauphiné Libéré,Le Télégramme, andLe Progrès) more than doubled the sales of national newspapers (likeLe Monde,Le Figaro,L'Équipe(sports),Le Parisien, andLes Echos(finance). Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centers, continue to increase their market share.[368]The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country.[369]"
"The most influential news magazines are the left-wingLe Nouvel Observateur, centristL'Expressand right-wingLe Point(in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),[370]but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among themMarie ClaireandELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papersLe Canard EnchaînéandCharlie Hebdo, as well asParis Match. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by asevere crisiswith the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[371][372]but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with theeconomic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[373]In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agencyORTFwas split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[374][375]remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending the state monopoly on radio.[375]"
"French cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[376][377]Different regions have different styles. In the North, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereasolive oilis more commonly used in the South.[378]Each region of France has traditional specialties:cassouletin the Southwest,choucroutein Alsace,quichein theLorraine region,beef bourguignoninBurgundy,provençaltapenade, etc. France is most famous for itswines,[379]andcheeses, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (AOC).[380][381]A meal typically consists of three courses,entrée(starter),plat principal(main course), andfromage(cheese) ordessert, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert."
"French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of thequality of lifeand the attractiveness of France. A French publication, theMichelin guide, awardsMichelin starsfor excellence to a select few establishments.[382][383]The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.[384]"
"In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine.French rumis made in distilleries located on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[385][386]"
"France hosts ""the world's biggest annual sporting event"", theTour de France.[388]Other popular sports played in France include:football,judo,tennis,[389]rugby union[390]andpétanque. France has hosted events such as the1938and1998 FIFA World Cups,[391]the2007 Rugby World Cup,[392]and the2023 Rugby World Cup.[393]The country also hosted the1960 European Nations' Cup,UEFA Euro 1984,UEFA Euro 2016and2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. TheStade de FranceinSaint-Denisis France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its24 Hours of Le Manssports carendurance race.[394]Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including theParis Mastersand theFrench Open, one of the fourGrand Slamtournaments. Frenchmartial artsincludeSavateandFencing."
"France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, BaronPierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[396][397]AfterAthenswas awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Gamesin 1900.[398]Paris was the first home of theInternational Olympic Committee, before it moved toLausanne.[399]Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[397]and threeWinter Games(1924inChamonix,1968inGrenobleand1992inAlbertville).[397]Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in1924with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic,Eugène Rubens-Alcaiswho paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of theSummer Deaflympicsin Paris.[400]"
"Both thenational football teamand thenational rugby union teamare nicknamed ""Les Bleus"" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the nationalFrench tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs.[401]"
"The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a majortennistournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at theStade Roland-Garrosin Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annualGrand Slamtournaments.[402]"
"Rugby unionis popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[403]The national rugby union team has competed at everyRugby World Cup; it takes part in the annualSix Nations Championship."

"France,countryof northwesternEurope. Historically and culturally among the most important nations in the Western world, France has also played a highly significant role in international affairs, with former colonies in every corner of the globe.

One can’t impose unity out of the blue on a country that has 265 kinds of cheese.”"
"This tendency towardindividualismjoins with a pluralist outlook and a great interest in the larger world. Even though its imperialist stage was driven by the impulse to civilize that world according to French standards (la mission civilisatrice), the French still note approvingly the words of writerGustave Flaubert:"
"I am no more modern than I am ancient, no more French than Chinese; and the idea ofla patrie, the fatherland—that is, the obligation to live on a bit of earth coloured red or blue on a map, and to detest the other bits coloured green or black—has always seemed to me narrow, restricted, and ferociously stupid."

Metropolitan Paris has now extended far beyond its ancient suburbs into the countryside, however, and nearly every French town and village now numbers a retiree or two driven from the city by the highcost of living, so that, in a sense, Paris has come to embrace the desert and the desert Paris."

The war was concluded with theÉvian Accordsin 1962 which led toAlgerian independence. Algerian independence came at a high price: it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over 2\xa0million internally displaced Algerians.[76]Around one million Pied-Noirs andHarkisfled from Algeria to France upon independence.[77]A vestige of the colonial empire are theFrench overseas departments and territories.', 'In the context of theCold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of ""national independence"" towards theWesternandEastern blocs.

However, he opposed any development of asupranational Europe, favouring a Europe ofsovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwideprotests of 1968, therevolt of May 1968had an enormous social impact. It was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as theGaullistparty emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle, who resigned shortly after.[78]', 'In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developedeconomies in the worldbut faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt.
