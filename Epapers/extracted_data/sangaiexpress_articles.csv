Jerusalem-Dec-29-Israeli-soldiers-ignored-cries-for-help-when-they-entered-a-Gaza-building-holding-three,"Jerusalem, Dec 29 : Israeli soldiers ignored cries for ""help"" when they entered a Gaza building holding three hostages just days before killing them by mistake, said a military investigation published on Thursday.The soldiers also heard ""hostages"" shouted in Hebrew on December 10, but interpreted that as a ""terrorist deception attempt"" by Hamas operatives to lure them into the building in the Gaza City district of Shejaiya, the probe said.Believing the building was rigged with explosives, the soldiers exited and killed five Hamas operatives trying to escape, it added.The hostages then probably fled the building also, and on December 15 Israeli soldiers shot them after mistakenly identifying them as a threat, the investigation said.Two were killed instantly. The third hostage fled and soldiers were ordered to hold fire in order to identify him, the probe said.Hearing cries of ""help!"" and ""they're shooting at me"", Israeli commanders asked the surviving hostage to advance towards the soldiers.But two soldiers ""who did not hear the order"" because of ""noise"" from a nearby tank shot him dead.The three hostages were all shirtless and one had been carrying a white flag.On December 14, an army drone had identified signs of ""SOS"" and ""help, three hostages"" on a building close to where the three hostages were shot.The army ""failed in its mission to rescue the hostages in this event,"" army chief Herzi Halevi said in a statement published along with the report of the investigation.The three fatalities ""could have been prevented"", he added.Soon after the killings of the hostages were announced, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it ""broke my heart"" and ""broke the whole nation's heart"".Israel has been mourning the deaths of the hostages identified as Yotam Haim, Alon Shamriz and Samer El-Talalqa.The killings of the three men, all in their twenties, have sparked protests in Tel Aviv, where demonstrators demanded that the authorities come up with a new plan to bring home the remaining 129 hostages still held in the Gaza Strip.About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas's October 7 attacks in Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, Israel launched a massive military offensive against the Palestinian Islamist movement that has left much of Gaza in ruins.The territory's Hamas government says the war has killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children.

RK-SanayaimaBy-the-end-of-2023-the-ethnic-violence-in-Manipur-had-taken-a-significant-toll-leading-to-the,"RK SanayaimaBy the end of 2023, the ethnic violence in Manipur had taken a significant toll, leading to the loss of over 200 lives and the displacement of nearly 60,000 individuals. Against the backdrop of ongoing turmoil in Manipur, a significant deficiency in India’s refugee policy has been thrust into the spotlight, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the Nation’s most fragile North Eastern region. A key concern amid the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur revolves around the influx of displaced people from Myanmar who have crossed the border into India. The majority of these border-crossers have left Myanmar due to the severe aftermath of the military coup in 2021. Armed clashes between the Myanmar military and various affiliated groups, including ethnic armed organizations and the People’s Defence Forces (PDFs), have displaced thousands of Myanmarese Nationals. Among these displaced individuals, a significant portion belongs to the Kuki-Chin-Zo ethnic group, and they have sought refuge in the Indian States of Manipur and Mizoram. This influx further complicates the challenges faced in Manipur and underscores the pressing need for comprehensive solutions to address this complex and distressing situation.Central to Manipur’s border predicament is the conspicuous dissonance between its predominantly porous borders and the modern construct of State boundaries. Less than 10% of Manipur’s 390 km international border with Myanmar is fenced, allowing significant cross-border migration. This permeability indicates the deep-seated ethnic affinities binding the Chin-Kuki-Zo populations on both sides of the border. These shared ethnic bonds prompt the Indian side to extend a welcoming reception to refugees from Myanmar, perceiving them as symbols of a shared heritage and unity that transcends conventional State boundaries.However, this approach sharply contrasts with the legalistic perspective of state authorities, who categorize these border crossings as ‘illegal’ and stress the inviolability of established state boundaries. Simultaneously, within Manipur, the Meitei community grapples with distinctive concerns, viewing these ‘illegal immigrants’ as potential security threats. This perception amplifies apprehension about demographic distortion within Manipur. Also, it induces anxiety due to the lack of assurance for an official repatriation policy upon political stability in Myanmar, further complicating the situation.The heightened sense of fear and apprehension prevailing in Manipur can be traced to the historical context of refugee challenges in the broader North Eastern region of India. Migration and displacement have posed significant dilemmas in this area, echoing comparable struggles in the neighboring States of Tripura and Assam. The historical narrative unfolds instances of population movements, often incited by factors such as ethnic conflicts, political unrest, and economic disparities. In Manipur’s case, the reverberation of these historical refugee issues has given rise to a complex and intertwined set of challenges for the indigenous population. The mirroring of circumstances in Tripura and Assam suggests that Manipur experiences akin patterns of demographic shifts, influxes of displaced individuals, and the resulting strain on resources and infrastructure. This parallelism exacerbates the pre-existing challenges tied to refugees in the region.This issue becomes glaringly apparent in a recent incident in which Lieutenant Colonel Venkata Ravi Kiran J, a General Staff Officer with The Assam Rifles, raised concerns by formalizing a letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Manipur’s Chandel district. The contents of Colonel Kiran J’s missive disclose alarming revelations : A significant influx of 718 individuals, classified as illegal immigrants, successfully breached Indian borders on the 22nd and 23rd of July of 2023 alone.The Absence of Formal Refugee Laws in India : Unravelling Manipur’s Ethnic UnrestOne of the most pressing challenges facing today is the glaring absence of legislation designed to address the issue of refugees seeking sanctuary within its borders. This legal vacuum has led to contentious conflicts within the region, driven by apprehension and mistrust. It is a striking irony that a Nation that has endured the bitter experience of forced displacement during the 1947 Partition has yet to establish a clear international or domestic refugee policy. India notably refrains from being a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 and its accompanying 1967 Protocol, which has exacerbated the ongoing turmoil in the region.The recent ethnic unrest witnessed in Manipur is not an isolated incident but rather a part of the larger fallout from India’s adhoc and selective refugee and migration policy. India’s response to the influx of refugees is marked by the absence of a formal and standardized refugee law, leading to a haphazard approach that is influenced by a complex web of factors, such as geopolitics, diplomacy, domestic politics, and local socio-cultural dynamics. This approach often results in a binary perspective that oscillates between “welcoming refugees” and “unwelcoming refugees.” One striking example of this binary approach is evident in India’s treatment of Tibetan refugees who fled their homeland following the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Initially, India embraced Tibetan refugees, capitalizing on Nationalistic sentiments fuelled by the 1962 border conflict with China. These moves garnered widespread public support for the Tibetan cause and served as a potent tool in the realm of vote-bank politics. However, over time, the treatment of Tibetan refugees has become increasingly complex, reflecting the changing political landscape and the shifting priorities of the Indian Government.In the face of the multifaceted challenges stemming from ethnic violence, demographic shifts, and border security concerns in Manipur, a comprehensive and forward-looking solution is imperative. The issues at hand demand a concerted effort to bridge the gaps in India’s refugee policy, address the pressing need for legislation, and foster understanding among communities affected by migration.To mitigate the immediate fallout from the recent surge in unauthorized border crossings, collaborative measures are necessary. These may include diplomatic engagement with Myanmar to address the root causes of displacement, coupled with international cooperation to provide humanitarian aid to those affected. The absence of formal refugee laws in India is a glaring gap that needs urgent attention. A comprehensive refugee policy, tailored to the unique challenges of the northeastern region, should be formulated. This policy must prioritize the protection of displaced individuals while addressing the concerns of local communities. By employing strategic and deliberate policy formulation, engaging in diplomatic discourse, fostering community interaction, and promoting international collaboration, we can endeavor to achieve a future characterized by enhanced stability and harmonious coexistence in the northeastern region.The writer is Assistant Professor, School of Law Manav Rachna University, Haryana"

Sivakumar-Vijayaraghavalu-PhD-Honey-a-golden-elixir-produced-by-bees-from-the-nectar-of-flowers-has-been,"Sivakumar Vijayaraghavalu (PhD)Honey, a golden elixir produced by bees from the nectar of flowers, has been revered across civilizations for millennia, not just as a sweetener but as a potent medicine. Its therapeutic virtues, documented in ancient texts and validated by modern science, offer a harmonious blend of natural remedy and scientific wonder. This article aims to demystify the medicinal benefits of honey, presenting a narrative that captivates the layman's curiosity while satisfying the scientific reader's scrutiny.A Natural AntibioticHoney's most celebrated property is its ability to act as a natural antibiotic. This is largely attributed to its unique composition: a low water content and high acidity level create an inhos- pitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen peroxide, produced when honey is diluted by bodily fluids, offers antiseptic properties. Studies have shown that honey can effectively inhibit the growth of harmful pathogens, making it a valuable ally in wound healing and infection prevention.The Soother of Coughs and Throat IrritationsThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes honey as a demulcent, a substance that relieves irritation of the mucous membranes in the mouth by forming a protective film. Its effectiveness in soothing coughs and throat irritations has been substantiated by clinical trials, which have found honey to be as effective, if not more so, than over-the-counter cough remedies, especially in children.An Antioxidant PowerhouseHoney is rich in antioxidants, including phenolic acids and flavonoids, which scavenge free radicals, reducing oxidative stress in the body. This antioxidant capacity contributes to a range of health benefits, from anti-inflammatory effects to the reduction of risk factors for heart disease. Regular consumption of honey has been linked to improved heart health markers, such as reduced levels of LDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) and triglycerides, as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol (""good"" cholesterol).A Natural Source of EnergyAs a carbohydrate-rich food, honey is an excellent source of natural energy. Its fructose and glucose are quickly absorbed by the body, providing an immediate energy boost. This makes honey an ideal pre-or post-workout snack for athletes and fitness enthusiasts, aiding in endurance and recovery.Enhancing Digestive HealthHoney's prebiotic properties—the ability to feed beneficial gut bacteria—support healthy digestion and may combat digestive issues such as diarrhea and ulcers. Manuka honey, in particular, has been researched for its effective- ness against Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium linked to stomach ulcers. Further, Honey is beneficial for various gastrointestinal disor- ders beyond just ulcers and diarrhea. It has been used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and could potentially protect the gut lining against damage from alcohol and certain drugs. Its anti-inflammatory properties can soothe the eso- phagus and protect against damage caused by acid reflux.Immune System BoostHoney's antioxidant and antibacterial properties contribute to its ability to strengthen the immune system. Regular consumption of honey, especially raw and unprocessed varieties, can stimulate the production of immune cells, helping the body to fight off infections more effectively. The antioxidants in honey, particularly in darker varieties, can also reduce inflammation and protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.A Natural Remedy for Seasonal AllergiesSome studies suggest that local honey, which contains pollen from local plants, can help desensitize the body to these allergens, reducing the symptoms of seasonal allergies. The theory is that consuming honey acts similarly to a natural vaccine: by introducing small amounts of pollen into the body, the immune system can gradually learn to tolerate them, lessening the severity of allergic reactions over time.Sleep AidHoney can be a helpful ally in promoting restful sleep. Consuming honey before bedtime can help in the release of melatonin in the brain because it increases insulin levels, which in turn releases serotonin. Serotonin is then converted to melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Additionally, the natural sugar in honey may slightly raise insulin levels, allowing tryptophan (the compound famous for causing sleepiness after eating turkey) to enter the brain more easily, thereby promoting sleep.Wound Healing and Burns : Honey is not only antibacterial but also maintains a moist wound con- dition, and its high viscosity helps to provide a protective barrier to prevent infection. Its effectiveness in treating burns and wounds has been demonstrated in numerous studies, with honey speeding up the healing process and reducing infection. The anti- inflammatory properties of honey also reduce pain and irritation associated with wounds and burns.Reduction of Chemotherapy Side EffectsEmerging research suggests that honey may have a role in alleviating side effects associated with che- motherapy, such as mucositis, a painful inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract. Honey's anti-inflammatory and wound- healing properties can offer relief and improve the quality of life for patients under- going cancer treatment.Skin Care and Dermatological ApplicationsThe application of honey extends beyond internal health benefits to dermatological care. Its moistu- rizing, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties make it an excellent natural remedy for a variety of skin conditions, including acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Ho-ney masks and topical applications can promote skin healing and rejuvenation.A Word of CautionDespite its myriad benefits, honey is not suitable for everyone. Infants under one year of age should not consume honey due to the risk of botulism. Individuals with allergies to bee products should also exercise caution.Bridging Tradition and ScienceThe medicinal benefits of honey, spanning from antimicrobial properties to antioxidative effects, represent a compelling synergy between traditional wisdom and scientific validation. Its versatility as a natural remedy and dietary supplement underscores the importance of integrating natural products into our healthcare and wellness practices.In conclusionHoney, with its myriad medicinal properties, serves as a bridge between the realms of natural remedies and scientific endorsement. Its ability to act as a natural antibiotic, soothe coughs, provide antioxidants, and enhance digestive health, among other benefits, showcases the profound impact of nature's bounty on human health. As modern research continues to explore and validate the therapeutic uses of honey, it reinforces the wisdom of ancient practices, reminding us of the importance of preserving and integrating natural products into our healthcare regimen.In embracing the benefits of honey, we also acknowledge the need for respon- sible consumption and consideration of individual health conditions, underscoring the balance between natural efficacy and safety. Honey's role in traditional and modern medicine exemplifies the timeless value of natural remedies, offering a sweet path to health and wellness that is as delicious as it is beneficial.As we continue to explore the depths of nature's pharmacy, honey stands out as a testament to the intricate connections between the environment, health, and well-being, inviting both laypeople and the scientific community to appreciate and harness its potential for a healthier future.The writer is an INNOVATOR AWARDEE – From Cleveland Clinic Foundation (#2 rank in the world), Cleveland, Ohio, USA Associate Professor, Department of Life Sciences (Zoology), Manipur University (Central University), Manipur, India and can be reached at[email protected];[email protected]"

NEW-DELHI-Dec-4India-is-among-top-20-countries-with-most-reported-dengue-cases-and-deaths-in-the-year-202,"NEW DELHI, Dec 4India is among top 20 countries with most reported dengue cases and deaths in the year 2023 — which recorded more than in the last five years annually, according to a report released on Sunday.The report, by aid agency Save the Children, showed that between January and November 2023, a whopping 5 million cases of dengue fever were recorded across 20 of the worst-impacted countries — marking a 30 per cent increase in cases compared to 2022 and 18 per cent more than the figures in 2019.It also found that at least 5,500 people were killed by dengue across the 20 countries, including India, up 32 per cent from 2022 and up 11 per cent compared to 2019.The actual number of deaths and cases is likely to be far higher as many cases are not reported, the report said. Bangladesh, which had the highest known global death toll, faced its worst dengue fever outbreak on record in 2023, with over 300,000 people infected since January, a massive jump from the 62,000 people known to have the illness in 2022.The outbreak resulted in 1,598 deaths — including over 160 children, mostly aged under 10 — with the death toll in 2023 more than five times that of 2022.“Across Asia, extreme weather events have contributed to making 2023 a devastating year for dengue deaths, throwing the lives of children into disarray. Children are impacted not only as the victims of dengue but by disruption to their education, increased economic and emotional pressure on their families, and when their caregivers contract and die from disease,” said Yasir Arafat, Save the Children’s Senior Health and Nutrition Advisor for Asia, in a statement.“We need local plans to fight dengue — at village and city level — and with the involvement of communities. Controlling mosquitos, diagnosing the disease and treatment needs to be a government-wide effort and not just the work of health departments. Funding needs to better anticipate extreme weather and climate shocks to manage the risk and not just the crisis,” he added.Dengue fever is a viral infection contracted via mosquito bites and can cause flu-like symptoms, including high fevers, pain behind the eyes, rash, severe headaches and body aches.In the most serious cases it can progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal.The report blamed this year’s El Nino event coupled with the climate crisis for the spike in the dengue fever outbreak.In July, the World Health Organisation reported that dengue has surged eight-fold in just over two decades from around half a million cases in 2000 to more than 4.2 million in 2022.PTI"
Zena-SinghKeeping-the-good-discarding-the-unwanted-is-a-natural-trend-in-life-s-many-circumstances-situat,"Zena SinghKeeping the good & discarding the unwanted is a natural trend in life’s many circumstances, situations and conditions. This shake-and-shrug off mostly brings on a positive and effective response.In struggles and challenges many who often fail in the effort of traipsing above it, around or under it are left with nothing else but to go ‘through’ it; not the self- sacrificing-to gain-martyrdom type but more the ‘accepting’ kind.Tramping along the long & winding pebbles of wise teachings that I have picked up and still picking, together with the descending mantle of discernment has sparked jolts of perception that leads me today to recount an occurrence once, that came with a revelation.‘Power Outage’. Once to me a feature fairly common, which I had started to vouch to have faded into a ‘had been’ up until a sudden black-out ‘hic’.Minutes stretched to hours and then into days bringing life to a grinding halt. Two thousand four hundred hours (or so) of no electric supply. The grouch in me awakened the snarl of irritability only a snap of a finger away. I recognized the threatening signs and a quick willful re-arrangement of my attitude and perspective revealed that this condition, though depriving me of any sort of entertainment, put instead, on my platter, free for-no-reason-at-all meals by soft candle light; technology with its perks tucked away, I managed catch ups on all the missed out beauty sleeps; minus on-line chit-chats, scrolls or browses brought forth double creative pursuits which I had perhaps involuntarily snuffed to a numbness and left dormant. Not willed or controlled by me, these ten ‘days nights’ turned into bestowed blessings. Life doles out things, unasked for drudges, however much it be out of sync with the regular.The revelation : When you can’t go against it, sidle gently and receive the goodness that flows quietly alongside it – believe me, you WILL be enriched twice as much because the Creator often uses our Setbacks to work out a Comeback.This is but one out of many instances that showcased God working in the midst of many of my setbacks. Immediate reactions to what we term setbacks do not often carry the best results.The response of Being–requires a ‘stillness’ that reveals stepping stones to where we truly should be-and that’s where thisBID (Blessing in Disguise) in a Setback brought me with MOM (Mind Over Matter)."

At least 15 people including some minors were killed in the strike.In addition, more than 30 people were also injured in the strike.Notably, Kanan is located along Asian Highway-I in Tamu district, about 50 Kms away from Tamu district headquarters.Kanan is situated between Khampat and Boukkan (Zoumun).The site hit by the airstrike is located between border pillar numbers 58 (Khampat) and 64 (Molcham).New Laijang, Yangnomphai, New Somtal, Aivomjang and Molcham in Manipur’s Chandel district are some of the villages on the Indian side of the border.Earlier on Thursday, at least five people including a child were killed and around 10 injured as Myanmar junta fighter jets bombarded Taze township in Sagaing region.The jet twice bombed Sein Nan village, killing a six-year-old boy, Htet Myat Aung, and four women.Five houses, a garage in the compound of a monastery and a school were destroyed, a resident said.Injured civilians were being treated and two women were in critical condition.Sein Nan is 50 Kms northwest of Taze with over 300 households at the edge of the large Maha Myaing forest, which is difficult for junta soldiers to raid, said an ethnic Kachin resident of Taze.In March, an MI-35 helicopter attacked a village near Sein Nan but no casualties were reported.Resistance groups have surrounded Taze town where Battalion 361 is stationed.Local media outlets put the death toll at 15 people, including children, with 20 wounded.But two witnesses -- a man and a woman who asked to remain anonymous for safety -- told AFP the toll was higher.""19 people were killed, including eight children,"" said the man, who said he saw a junta jet fighter overhead during the attack.He said the first bombs targeted two Churches in the village, and a second attack came as people fled the buildings.""Most of them were killed outside the Church area as they were running to escape,"" he said.Women and children were among those killed in the attack, which was made more deadly because of the crowds, he said.In total the jet dropped six bombs, he said.""They targeted the two Churches, but bombs hit outside the two Churches, and hit some houses,"" he said.Another device landed near the community's school, he added. State media said late Sunday that reports of the attack were ""fake news"", with MRTV saying there had been no aircraft operating in the area at the time.The village is under the control of the People's Defence Force (PDF) group, one of many that have sprung up to fight the junta.The military has designated the groups as ""terrorists"".On Sunday, a planned graduation ceremony for new recruits had been relocated to a nearby jungle.""If they came to bomb our graduation area, we cannot blame them,"" the man said, referencing the army.""But they bombed the wrong place and bombed public Churches and areas.""He and the woman told AFP that 30 people were wounded.She warned that the casualty rate could rise, with some people seriously hurt.They were being treated at a clinic, she said, without giving further details.

WASHINGTON-Feb-19Abraham-Lincoln-pardoned-Joe-Biden-s-great-great-grandfather-after-a-late-night-Civil-War-,"WASHINGTON, Feb 19Abraham Lincoln pardoned Joe Biden's great-great-grandfather after a late-night Civil War-era brawl, documents reportedly show, linking the two US presidents across the centuries.The court martial records in the US National Archives, reported on by the Washington Post Monday, detail the trial of Moses J Robinette after a fight with fellow Union Army civilian employee John J.Alexander on March 21, 1864.Robinette was charged with attempted murder after the tussle in the Army of the Potomac's winter camp in Virginia, when Alexander overheard him saying something about him to a cook, and rushed at him.The two men scuffled, and Robinette drew his pocketknife, leaving Alexander with several cuts before others intervened, according to the documents.The 42-year-old, who had been hired by the army as a veterinary surgeon, insisted that Alexander ""possibly might have injured me seriously had I not resorted to the means I did.""But military judges convicted him and sentenced him to two years' hard labor.Three army officers petitioned Abraham Lincoln to overturn his conviction, claiming the sentence was unduly harsh and that Robinette had been defending himself against someone ""much his superior in strength and size.""Abraham Lincoln agreed, and signed the pardon on September 1 that same year.The story ""has waited 160 years to be told,"" according to the Washington Post article, written by historian David J. Gerleman.The ""slender sheaf of 22 well-preserved pages of his trial transcript, unobtrusively squeezed among many hundreds of other routine court-martial cases in the National Archives, reveals the hidden link between the two men -- and between two presidents across the centuries,"" Gerleman wrote.""Those few pages not only fill in an unknown piece of Biden family history, but also serve as a reminder of just how many Civil War stories have yet to be told.""

Brussels-Feb-12The-world-just-experienced-its-hottest-January-on-record-continuing-a-run-of-exceptional-he,"Brussels, Feb 12The world just experienced its hottest January on record, continuing a run of exceptional heat fuelled by climate change, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday. Last month surpassed the previous warmest January, which occurred in 2020, in C3S's records going back to 1950.The exceptional month came after 2023 ranked as the planet's hottest year in global records going back to 1850, as human-caused climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, pushed temperatures higher.Every month since June has been the world's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years.""Not only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5 C (1.7 F) above the pre-industrial reference period,"" C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said.""Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing,"" she said.US scientists have said 2024 has a one-in-three chance of being even hotter than last year, and a 99% chance of ranking in the top five warmest years.The El Nino phenomenon began to weaken last month, and scientists have indicated it could shift to the cooler La Nina counterpart later this year. Still, average global sea surface temperatures last month were the highest for any January on record.Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent global warming surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid it unleashing more severe and irreversible consequences.Despite exceeding 1.5 C in a 12-month period, the world has not yet breached the Paris Agreement target, which refers to an average global temperature over decades.Some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, but have urged governments to act faster to cut CO2 emissions to limit overshooting the target - and the deadly heat, drought and rising seas that this would inflict on people and ecosystems - as much as possible.

Sir-Earthquakes-are-one-of-the-many-dangerous-and-destructive-natural-disasters-that-can-occur-any,"Sir,Earthquakes are one of the many dangerous and destructive natural disasters that can occur anywhere in the world, and as the recent quakes in Turkey and Syria demonstrate, they are definitely cause for concern.To begin with, there is no link between weather and earthquakes. This makes sense because earthquakes occur underground, where surface temperature and conditions have no bearing. However, climate change has the potential to affect earthquakes.This is due to the fact that the only true variable in earthquakes is the amount of stress on a fault line. According to NASA, the most likely scenario is that climate change causes surface water to add to the stress on a fault.There are also droughts. Droughts, according to NASA researchers, can change the size of mountains due to water loss. In theory, this could result in a change in stress on faults. Other studies have found that  groundwater extraction during droughts can affect stress by essentially changing the weight of the planet's crust, which can cause changes between both sides of a fault line and cause an earthquake.Then there are glaciers, which move as well. Glacial earthquakes can occur as glaciers shift due to climate change.Therefore to reduce earthquakes lowering stress loads is very much essential. In other words, climate change could play a role in earthquakes.Yours faithfully,Vijay Kumar HK,Environmentalist,Raichur, Karnataka"
The-Manipur-Human-Rights-Commission-has-done-its-job-Now-it-is-left-to-be-seen-what-course-of-action-the-Stat,"The Manipur Human Rights Commission has done its job. Now it is left to be seen what course of action the State Government particularly the Social Welfare Depart- ment takes up to plug the loopholes. It was on March 17 that a two-man team from the Rights Commission led by its Chairperson Justice UB Saha inspected two rehabilitation centres at Thoubal district and found a number of lapses. Obviously the lapses must have been calculated according to the guidelines set by the State Social Welfare Depart- ment and such guidelines cannot come within the understanding of confidential or classified information of the Government. It is something which must be out in the public domain more so for the benefits of all those opening and running rehabilitation centres across Manipur. Rehabilitation centre, as a term, is not something foreign or alien to the people of Manipur, with drug or psycho-active substance abuse or to use the politically correct term use, alcoholism and other forms of substance dependency, having gained currency in the last many decades. The toll that drug use and alcoholism has taken has been heavy and it is to these centres many families, particularly the elders turn to, to set right their children or youngsters who may have fallen into the clutches of these psycho-active substances. It was with a reason why the Social Welfare Department issued a series of guidelines for rehab centres to follow, all with the stated objective of ensuring that these centres respect the rights of the inmates and follow a certain set of parameters in housing and treating those dependent on psycho-active substance. The question is how many of the rehab centres opened and operating in Manipur actually conform to the standard protocol laid down by the Social Welfare Department ? If the initial findings of the MHRC, while inspecting two such rehab centres is any indication, the norms and regulations laid down are being violated with impunity with the said centres found not even entering the details of the inmates admitted in 2024. This is a cause of concern, especially in the backdrop of the fact that an inmate passed away after being subjected to intense physical assault inside a rehab centre some years back. Earlier a certain rehab centre at Churachandpur had gained notoriety for keeping the inmates under chain. One wonders why some rehab centres are not keen to stick to the guidelines set down by the Social Welfare Department and if they are not in a position to adhere to the dos laid down, then what is stopping the Government from acting and closing down such centres ?The very name, rehabilitation centre should say it all. It is a centre to rehabilitate those dependent on drugs or any other intoxicating stuffs and certainly such centres should not and cannot be reduced to the understanding of an isolation centre or a detention centre where rough looking men trained to crack down hard on the inmates rule the roost. Amid the cause of concern, what is heartening is the fact that the Manipur Human Rights Commission has made it clear that it is intent on reforming the ills. It is in line with this that just one day after the inspection drive, the MHRC wrote to the DGP of the State police and the Social Welfare Department to monitor the functioning of all rehabilitation centres. One hopes there are more follow up actions on this and it would help if reports from the police and the Social Welfare Department can be made public. The understanding of why there are rehabilitation centres should be clear to all. Stern action ought to be taken up if and when any of these centres are found violating the guidelines issued by the competent authority. One also hopes that the MHRC takes up from the admission of some of the inmates that they were forcefully admitted to the rehab centre ! Who are the ‘do gooders’ ? Certainly not the way in which drug dependent persons should be put on the way to recovery. Drug dependent individuals are part of society and it is only right that the place set up to  help them recover function under the established norms and guidelines. Is the Government doing enough that it should nudge the MHRC to inspect and recommend that these centres be monitored ? This very question should say so many things !"

A-dialogue-Sit-across-the-table-and-talk-things-over-This-is-what-anyone-with-a-modicum-of-sensibility-would,"A dialogue. Sit across the table and talk things over. This is what anyone with a modicum of sensibility would advocate to resolve the ongoing ethnic clash and there cannot be two ways about it. And for anyone to come to the negotiating table, the right atmosphere must be created and this is where the Government must step in. The question is whether Imphal has the trust and confidence of the two communities which are on either side of the clash divide and this is where New Delhi would need to intervene and initiate matters. Perhaps the Government of India may seriously study the possibility and the merit of reaching out to the other major community which has remained neutral so far, the Nagas, to reach out to either side and see how to proceed with the matter. As announced by Chief Minister N Biren, Chairman of the Hill Area Committee, D Gangmei, has started reaching out to the ten Kuki-Zo MLAs but the need to give this a further boost need not be overstressed. There has also been a report of the Naga MLAs holding talks with the 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs at Guwahati some time back and while all these initiatives are noted, perhaps it will help if efforts are made to see if the Government may reach out to the Naga civil society organisations and see what may be done from this angle too. The service of the United Naga Council, the Senapati based Naga People’s Organisation, the Ukhrul based Tangkhul Naga Long,  the Chandel based Chandel Naga People’s Organisation etc may be sought to see if  the first step to talk things with the Kuki-Zo people represented by their CSOs such as the Kuki Inpi Manipur, Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum and Committee on Tribal Unity can be taken. These are all suggestions but it would not hurt to see if the service of the Naga People’s Front can be used to reach out to the Kuki People’s Alliance to talk things over. This is at the level of political parties, but a beginning has to be made, for remember there can be no winner in the ongoing clash. Imphal must also admit that it is in the midst of the crisis that numerous power centres have emerged raising a big question on the understanding of the rule of law. It is in such a situation that the credibility of the Government can get eroded and the Manipur that one sees today comes uncomfortably close to this understanding.The BJP led Government at Imphal has its task cut out. The first obviously is to resolve the ongoing ethnic clash and the second is to ensure that there is a Government in place and for this to happen, it has to demonstrate that the Government is there to uphold the rule of law. And the first step towards is to demonstrate that the Government sticks by the letter and spirit of the rule of law. Gun and muscle power that seems to be ruling the streets and roads of Manipur must be reined in. No one should come under the impression that they are the law unto themselves and for this to happen the Government should demonstrate that it means business. How are the different business houses operating ? How hard have they been hit by the ongoing clash and the developments thereof ? How free do the people feel about airing their opinion and their stand on any of the issues which keep emerging from time to time ? These are questions which the Government should deal with for the very fact that these questions have been raised should tell so many things. In a short while Manipur, like the rest of the country, will go to polls to elect their two MPs and the run up to the election will be the best time for the different political parties and candidates to raise the questions that have been mentioned. It will  be interesting to see how the Government works itself in a position to answer these questions convincingly and comfortably. One hopes the initiatives taken so far to reach out for a dialogue and resolve the clash bears fruit and the need to give more push to the initiatives already taken up need not be stressed here. One also wonders when Imphal will be able to work itself into a position that it can draw the attention of the Prime Minister to personally address the ethnic clash here. No Act East Policy will be able to address the sense of alienation felt by the people of Manipur due to the silence of the Prime Minister, for it now borders on indifference."
Prof-Himanshu-Rai-Director-IIM-Indore-Contd-from-previous-issueUniversities-embraced-curriculum-revision,"Prof Himanshu Rai (Director, IIM Indore)Contd from previous issueUniversities embraced curriculum revisions, introducing flexible credit systems, choice-based cour-ses, and industry-aligned specializations. Collaborative research initiatives with leading institutions, both domestic and international, flourished, propelling India’s research output onto the global stage.Teacher Training endea-vors like Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching, Quality Improvement Program, National Mission on Men-toring, ATAL FDPs, etc, have been significant contributors towards faculty development.The rise of digital education platforms like SWA- YAM (which was expanded and enriched in terms of the courses in 2016) and MOOCs revolutionized access to quality education. Online degree programs further expanded options. Setting up of the National Digital University could be transformational. Initiatives like “Digital India” and “BharatNet” focused on improving internet connec- tivity across the country, paving the way for wider adoption of digital learning tools.India’s ascent in higher education is also evidenced by its impressive research output and innovation. As reported by the US National Science Foundation’s 2022 report, India ranked third globally in scientific publications in 2020, a leap from seventh in 2010. The research output grew by 54% between 2017 and 2022, outpacing the global average. This period saw 1.3 million academic papers and 8.9 million citations. In innovation, patent filings surged by 30% from 2016-17 to 2020-21.Conclusion:Over the past decade, India’s higher education sector has not just kept pace with global trends but often led the way. Through substantial policy reforms and the integration of advanced technological tools, it has been reimagined to meet the aspirations of a young, dynamic India. While the progress is evident in the data, challenges such as equitable access, quality improvement, and fostering diverse research areas remain. The continued commitment to investment, policy refinement, and innovation is essential for sustaining and accelerating this remarkable journey of educational transformation."

JERUSALEM-Oct-12-Palestinians-lined-up-outside-bakeries-and-grocery-stores-in-Gaza-on-Thursday-after-spendi,"JERUSALEM, Oct 12 : Palestinians lined up outside bakeries and grocery stores in Gaza on Thursday after spending the night surrounded by the ruins of pulverized neighborhoods darkened by a near-total power outage. Israel launched new airstrikes and said it was preparing for a possible ground invasion.International aid groups warned that the death toll in Gaza could mount after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity and the tiny enclave’s crossing with Egypt closed. The war — which was ignited by a bloody and wide-ranging assault on Israel by Hamas militants — has already claimed at least 2,500 lives on both sides.Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver if decided,” but that political leaders have not yet ordered one. A ground offensive in Gaza, whose 2.3 million residents are densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.As Israel pounds Gaza, Hamas fighters have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since their weekend assault. Militants in the territory are also holding an estimated 150 people taken hostage from Israel.Already, Palestinians fleeing airstrikes could be seen running through the streets, carrying their belongings and looking for a safe place. Tens of thousands have crowded into UN-run schools while others are staying with relatives or even strangers who let them in.Lines formed outside bakeries and grocery stores during the few hours they dared open, as people tried to stock on food before shelves were emptied. On Wednesday, Gaza’s only power station ran out of fuel and shut down, leaving only lights powered by scattered private generators.A senior official with the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that a lack of electricity could cripple hospitals.“As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can’t be taken,” said Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC’s regional director. “Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues.”Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz said nothing would be allowed into Gaza until the captives were released. “Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on, and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” he tweeted.After Hamas militants stormed through a border fence Saturday and massacred hundreds of Israelis in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “crush and destroy” the group, which has governed Gaza since 2007.“Every Hamas member is a dead man,” Netanyahu said in a televised address late Wednesday.The Israeli government is under intense public pressure to topple the militant group rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza after four previous conflicts ended with Hamas still firmly in charge of the territory. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities.Netanyahu now has the backing of a new war Cabinet that includes a longtime opposition politician. The US has also pledged unwavering support, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders. He plans to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordan’s King Abdullah II.The Israeli military said overnight strikes targeted Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces, including command centers used by the fighters who attacked Israel on Saturday, and the home of a senior Hamas naval operative that it said was used to store unspecified weapons.

New-Delhi-Feb-1There-will-be-no-change-to-income-tax-slabs-which-have-been-reduced-and-rationalised-in-th,"New Delhi, Feb 1There will be no change to income tax slabs, which have been reduced and rationalised, in the 2024 interim Budget, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Thursday morning, as she read out a statement of the country's finances in a special session of Parliament. ""I propose to retain the same tax rates for direct and indirect taxes, including import duties,"" Ms Sitharaman said.She did, though, propose to withdraw outstanding direct tax demands of up to Rs 25,000 till FY09/10 and up to Rs 10,000 for FY10/11 to 14/15, and said it would benefit around one crore tax payers.On that count, Ms Sitharaman said, ""... there are a large number of petty, non-verified, non-reconciled, or disputed, direct tax demands, many dating to 1962, which remain on the books, causing anxiety to honest taxpayers... I propose to withdraw such outstanding direct tax demands.""On the overall tax picture, the Finance Minister said direct collections had more than trebled in the past 10 years, and the number of people filing returns had increased 2.4 times.The hold on revisions to tax slabs was not unexpected given this is an interim budget-essentially to keep the Government running till a new administration is elected and takes charge later this year.A full Union Budget will likely be presented in July.Nevertheless, that tax slabs will stay the same will disappoint salaried taxpayers, particularly in the middle class, which had been hoping for cuts to help deal with perennial cost-of-living concerns.However, a significant point for taxpayers is that, as of now, both the old and new tax regimes will continue, meaning people can choose between them when filing their returns. Ms Sitharaman also touched on the introduction of new forms and software to make filing easier and simpler.The average processing time of tax returns have been reduced from 93 days in 2014 to just 10 days this year, thereby making refunds faster, she said.Viksit BharatPresenting her sixth straight (but first interim) budget, Nirmala Sitharaman also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Government is working to make India a 'Viksit (Developed) Bharat' by 2047, and that this development would be ""all round, all inclusive, and all pervasive"".""Our vision for Viksit Bharat is that of a prosperous Bharat... in harmony with nature and modern infrastructure, and providing opportunities for all to reach their potential. The next five years will see unprecedented development and golden moments to realise the goal of a developed India...""Ms Sitharaman said the Government plans to form a ""high-powered committee"" for an ""extensive consideration of challenges arising from fast population growth and demographic challenges"".""The committee will be mandated to make recommendations to address these challenges comprehensively, in relation to the goal of 'Viksit Bharat',"" she explained.Specifically, Ms Sitharaman spoke about the Government's focus on four categories of society-the poor, women, young men and women, and farmers. The Modi Government's focus on women and women-led development, its Nari Shakti motto, is widely expected to be a major election plank.Ms Sitharaman said FDI (foreign direct investment) inflow between 2014 and 2023 had marked a ""golden era"". The sum of $596 billion was twice that between 2005 and 2014, she said.To encourage sustained foreign investment, the Government is negotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreign partners in the spirit of FDI, or 'First Develop India', she said.Global ChallengesThe Finance Minister also spoke about the global context of development, acknowledging that increasingly fragile geopolitical situations across the world-such as wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and tension in the Middle East, as well as the spectre of terrorism-had created new challenges.Despite these challenges, Ms Sitharaman hailed the Modi Government for delivering high growth and ensuring it maintains its ""exemplary track record of Governance, Development, and Performance"". ""Our Government has provided transparent, accountable, and people-centric, trust-based administration, with citizen-first, minimum- Government, and maximum-governance mode."" NDTV"
New-Delhi-Dec-11-The-Supreme-Court-Monday-refused-to-entertain-a-fresh-PIL-seeking-a-direction-to-the-Centre,"New Delhi, Dec 11: The Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain a fresh PIL seeking a direction to the Centre to intervene and restore law and order in ethnic violence-hit Manipur, besides setting up a panel of experts to prepare a report on the underlying causes for the crisis and suggest remedial measures.A bench comprising Chief justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra took note of the submissions of senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the PIL petitioners, and said a committee was already looking into the issues related to the violence and other aspects.“There was a need for a committee which can get all the communities to the table,” the senior lawyer, assisted by advocate Neha Rathi, said.“This Court has already constituted a committee chaired by Justice (retired) Gita Mittal. It’s open to make a representation to the committee. At this stage, we believe that broad and general reliefs would not result in anything,” the bench said.It asked petitioners Yumlembam Surjit Singh, Keisham Arish and Laishram Momo Singh to approach the Justice Gita Mittal panel.The top Court is already hearing a batch of petitions on the ethnic violence in the State and had set up a committee of three former HC women Judges to take stock of the situation and suggest corrective measures.

Joykisan explained that judicial custody means to be kept in jail and added that the five individuals are instead present at JNIMS. Asking why they are being kept at the hospital, Joykisan questioned if the doctors concerned can provide any documents or proofs which can show that the said individuals had stayed in any hospital for an extended period of time. Accusing the Government of directly or indirectly attempting to protect the said individuals, the MLA demanded the State Government to clarify to the people why it is fearful of handing over the case to the CBI."

We sail into the New Year, seeking hope's release,Yet gray skies still shroud us,And peace seems but an obsolete word!In this societal turmoil, where can we find rest?What New Year's resolution could heal this unrest?Every sensible mind yearns for a humane way,A meaningful dialogue for the ""Apple of discord""Where hearts and minds can sway.Peace and normalcy, a dream we long to see,Displaced souls returning home, tormented spirits set free.The journey ahead is challenging, it's true!But a new beginning has dawned, with hope anew.An awakening from a brutal nightmare's hold,It's time to act, yes to be bold and kind.For we will reap what we sow today,With people's power, hope will be our catalyst.Let us step into an era free from strife,Let organizations unite, bringing purpose to life.Let the walls between us crumble and fall ,Let love and compassion sway gently,Leaders with hearts of wisdom, minds of grace,Guiding with empathy, uniting every space.For there's no glory in war, a truth we must embrace,Misery, the only laurel and death's destructive chase.It shatters not just our land, but our close-knitted souls as well,Leaving mangled pieces,And stories are too “painful to tell.“"
On-the-road-to-Parkia-festival-venue-at-New-TusomProfiling-two-budding-singers-with-no-support,"Mungchan ZimikUkhrul, Dec 23 : A day-long travel to the last Northern Tangkhul village to attend a Parkia festival at New Tusom village with two young girls who had immense love for music was just exciting and memorable.Although,  it was a long stormy drive, knowing them better made the journey wholesome.This correspondent had a warm conversation with these two female singers -Yarshim Wungsek and Semmichon Kashung while journeying together.Yarshim Wungsek who hails from Shirui village, Ukhrul said that she began singing from Class-II onward.She went on to mention she learned music from her father Kapangkhui who is also a local musician.Though Yarshim has not acquired any musical degree, her love for music has enabled her to play the guitar and sing musical notes appreciably.Yarshim Wungsek, who has a husky voice and can sing high notes, disclosed that she stopped singing at the age of 13 due to health issues.After a gap of many years,  she started singing again professionally from 2017 through the support of some renowned local artistes.Semmichon Kashung, on the other hand who is a cover singer possesses a melodious voice but declined to explain why she is embracing music.Semmichon,  however, stated that she will reveal her story and why she chose music through a song one day.Both the girls, Yarshim and Semmichon mentioned that they are preparing to release their own music albums.The financial constraint is the one main factor that is hindering the two struggling singers in pursuing their dream.It might be mentioned that more than 10 Tangkhul artistes showcased their musical talents in the three days Parkia festival at New Tusom village.Though there are many more Yarshims and Semmichons out there in different parts of the State with similar dreams, they may just fade and it is here that collective support and encouragement from the Government as well as the masses is highly needed."
Hon-ble-Sir-I-would-like-to-quote-a-few-lines-from-the-editorial-referred-above-Here-is-a-cas,"Hon’ble Sir,I would like to quote a few lines from the editorial referred above --- “Here is a case of concern and even alarm being raised over renaming a certain locality to suit the ethnicity of a people who came later to the place and such a practice if not checked in time would send the wrong message that any group of people can go, settle in a place and then give the place a name which identifies it with a certain group of people.This is why the call to Constitutionally protect the land of the Meiteis become crucial and one should come to the realization that the only way to protect the interest of the Meiteis will lie in getting Constitutional protection and the most feasible way forward would be to regain the Tribe status it once had ……….. Among the Meiteis who oppose it, let them see the reality that is knocking at their doors.”In this regard, I would like to subscribe my viewpoints for your kind perusal.1) That generally all the places have their own original names, except in remote or uninhabited regions. Then why a new comer or group of people rename the place where they newly settle ?As a practice we notice so many localities/pockets in Imphal valley have been given new names by the newcomers in disregard/suppression of the earlier names. Whether they have been given recognition to these new names by the Govt. (or Revenue Dept.) by entering in their pattas or other Govt. documents ? Such practice, as pointed out by the Editor of this daily is not desirable at all and also not in the greater interest of the state. This may kindly be looked into and redressed for good.2) That the terms Meitei and Meetei are almost the same and mean the same people. Still we are using these two terms i.e. Meitei/Meetei in demanding restoration of tribal status of the Meiteis. It will be nice to use only one term instead of using two, to show our unity and integrity forgetting the difference of opinions in this regard. Otherwise it may cause hindrance in demanding restoration of ST status of the Meiteis. Now we need Constitutional protection for our survival. So your good self would be kind enough to see our interest and send the recommendation of the State Govt. to enlist them in the list of ST category to the Govt. of India at the earliest.3) That as a last option, the Govt. of India may kindly be convinced of our peculiar situation which is represented below.Total area of the State---------22,327 Sq. KmValley area --------- 1,843 Sq. Km (8.25%)Geographically Manipur as a whole is a hilly State.In the valley a) hills and hillocks (including Reserved Forest) occupy about                             ------300 Sq. Km.b)  Wetlands including Loktak lake, other smaller lakes, rivers etc. occupy about------350 Sq.Kmc) offices, institutions, roads, hospitals, temples, churches, mosques, airport etc. occupy about ------ 10 Sq.KmThe remaining area (1843 - 660=1183 Sq.Km.) constitutes the settlement area and cultivated area.All the communities can settle and will settle in this small valley. However the Meiteis (general category) cannot settle outside this small valley, even inside the State. How long will they be able to survive in such a situation ? Under such Constitutional mechanism the Meiteis are shrinking day by day. Still the biggest democracy in the world cannot/does not realize it. What a big injustice it is ! The problem will become more acute when the Railways reach Imphal. In short, we are sitting in a sinking ship. Who will feel pity for us ?In the above facts and circumstances, the Govt. of India may be requested to formulate a practical/suitable solution under the Constitution of India to protect the Meiteis and their land before it is too late."
Dr-K-Rashbehari-SinghContd-from-previous-issuePets-provide-comfort-and-companionship-This-may-be-particul,"Dr K Rashbehari SinghContd from previous issuePets provide comfort and companionship. This may be particularly true for children who have difficulty making friends.There are many mental health benefits of pet ownership. It has been shown to reduce stress, depression and anxiety and improve overall quality of life. Pets can divert negative thoughts, promote exercise and provide a calm presence.  Emotional companionship is the greatest direct benefit of pet ownership. It can even be life-saving for people living with mental illness. Pets are a consistent source of unconditional love and affection and they intuitively provide this support in times of need and can be a helpful distraction from ruminations on negative thoughts, including suicidal tendency.Pets seemingly listen without response, there is no fear of interruptions, criticisms and advice, and maintain confidentiality. They make people feel good about themselves and provide reasons to live.Cardiovascular healthInteracting with companion animals is associated with beneficial effects including lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels.Stress reductionOne of the best parts of being a canine (or feline) is the power to alleviate our stress. Our brain release “feel good” or happiness hormones when petting and cuddling of pets, and we experience a decrease in stress hormones. This process boosts mood and can even relieve pain. Interacting with an animal result in a measurable decrease in levels of cortisol (a stress hormone). High levels of stress can weaken immune function. It seems that a positive interaction with an animal boosts our levels of oxitocin (a hormone associated with bonding and affection), which counteracts the effects of stress on the body and mind.Encourage exercise and activityExercise is essential in dog’s health and well-being, and too little exercise can cause behavioural problems. Exercise is also a critical component of mental health of humans. Dogs motivate us to take a walk. People who walk their dogs are more likely to reach a healthy level of moderate-intensity physical activity.Making healthier and more resilientPets offer unconditional love, which can increase confidence and self esteem to the owners. They provide physical as well as psychological benefits to pet owners, and may contribute to improved resiliency.Personal wellnessAmong senior citizens, those who own either a dog or a cat are statistically more capable of a range of activities such as climbing stairs, bending, kneeling, stooping, preparing meals, bathing and dressing, and correctly taking medication, compared with those who do not own either dog or cat. It is thought that through caring of their pets, they practice these same skills and concurrently keep themselves healthier and more capable as well.Improved moodSimple act of stroking a friendly animal increases dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, two chemicals that are essential for happiness and relaxation.Therapy dogsTherapy dogs are dogs that are trained to provide affection, comfort and support to people, often in settings such as hospitals, retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, libraries, hospices, or disaster areas. Therapy dogs are present in physical therapy sessions or social work environments and serve to improve people’s motivation to reach goals.Fostering a strong human-animal bondAs pets are individuals who have needs and desires, pet owners should allow their pets to interact with them in appropriate ways. Spend time with your pet as well as giving them adequate exercise, playtime, socialization, and more. Pets also benefit from being able to experience different environments and in this process pets develop skills such as problem-solving that can help them later in life.ConclusionThe human-animal bond is a type of social bond that humans have with animals, characterized by emotional attachment and mutual care and support. This bond can help animals to live longer, healthier and happier lives. The human-animal bond can be strengthened through interaction with animals, and taking steps to reduce human-animal conflict.  Being a pet owner is a big responsibility, but it is well worth. Owning a pet have the power to provide a wide range of physical and mental health benefits and a faithful friend is always in our corner.Dr K Rashbehari Singh is Member, Manipur State Veterinary Council, Imphal &  Retired Deputy Director (Extension Education), Central Agricultural University, Imphal.

Just-like-the-call-of-the-United-Naga-Council-some-days-back-not-to-target-or-victimise-the-Nagas-in-the-ong,"Just like the call of the United Naga Council, some days back, not to target or victimise the Nagas in the ongoing clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis, the call of the All Manipur Christian Organisation (AMCO) not to desecrate Churches, Temples and sacred sites should be noted and appreciated for its mature approach. As the name itself suggests, AMCO is a Christian organisation, but it has stuck by the understanding of Christianity, best exemplified by its call not to hurt the sentiments of any religious group. Desecrating or targeting places of worship is abominable enough but it becomes all that more dangerous when a place of worship, a sacred site, is targeted with a political motive, a motive to lay ancestral claim to a place and this is what Manipur has been witnessing ever since the place went up in flames from the evening of May 3, 2023. At the same time it is also important to note that giving a religious angle to the ongoing clash is nothing but to  earn the sympathy of the Western countries and it was this card that was played to such perfection that the ongoing clash, read as attacks on Churches and persecution of a religious minority, featured on the floor of the European Parliament in the earlier part of the more than 9 months old clash. That such a move boomeranged in the ultimate analysis is a different matter, but here is a case of false narratives being peddled to the outside world to gang up against the Meiteis. And the sinister political ploy and move continues unabated. The Cross erected atop Mount Thangjing, the story of which has gone viral in the last many days, should be seen beyond the immediate act of imposing a religious line of thought at a place held sacred by the Meiteis for centuries, but is also a covert and overt attempt to lay claim on the ancestral abode of the Meiteis. A point which Manipur should take note of with the seriousness it deserves. Look beyond the Cross, but see it as an attempt to lay ancestral claim on a spot. This is the bottomline. Apart from Mount Thangjing, one can take a look at Mt Koubru, a sacred site for the Meiteis for centuries and it is for this very reason why there is the annual trek to the peak of this mountain. If Cheiraoching had been situated further from Imphal, the annual prayers offered atop this hill could well have been jeopardised on the fantastic claim that it is the ancestral land of the Kukis !!Nothing Christianlike in erecting or putting up a Cross atop Mount Thangjing, as the International Meetei Christian Youth Assembly (IMYCA) pointed out the other day. This very act goes against the teachings of the Bible, as the Meetei Churches Advocacy for Peace and Development (MCAPD) put it and this is where it becomes important for New Delhi and Imphal to look beyond the religious connotation of the Cross and look at the political agenda. The bigger agenda should be clear to all, especially to the Government. The very act of taking to the streets to protest the deployment of State forces at Moreh is not just a case of protesting against the State police, but is also a clear indication that the border town should and will remain under the control of the Kuki militants. The prospects of India’s Act East Policy has certainly not flown over the head of the gun toting militants at the border town. A look at the demographic composition of the border town in the 1970s and before the Naga-Kuki ethnic clash erupted in 1992 and the present reality should more than say about the larger political conspiracy at work. Churches were indeed targeted by mobs at Imphal and in the valley areas in the initial days of the clash, but to equate this with the systematic approach adopted to lay claim on the ancestral land of Manipur would be missing the trees for the woods. Note the stress on the words, ‘targeted by mobs’ and ‘systematic approach’ and this should reinforce the need to look beyond the immediate and acknowledge the larger political agenda at work."
Sir-From-the-perspective-of-Assam-Rifles-and-the-security-forces-in-the-region-it-is-important-to-clarify,"Sir,From the perspective of Assam Rifles and the security forces  in the region, it is important to clarify a few points regarding the situation at Moreh:a) The portrayal of Moreh, a thriving semi-cosmopolitan town traversed by the trans-Asiatic road and boasting the presence of numerous State and Central agencies, as having a deteriorated law and order situation is indeed incomprehensible. Moreh being a mini replica of Imphal City with multiple ethnicities, has all Central and State agencies, including the Custom Dept firmly entrenched in the administration machinery. Internal law and order matters are primarily the responsibilities of the respective State Government agencies, and holding these accountable for their performance is imperative for addressing any shortcomings in governance and security.b) The Assam Rifles has successfully safeguarded the Indo-Myanmar border from cross border infiltration of militia notwithstanding the FMR agreement (or the lack of it) along the length of the IMB. In the last two years Assam Rifles has pushed back approx five thousand Myanmarese citizens from IMB, and shared details of the balance 1200 localised refuge seekers pro-actively with the State agencies for further disposal. Additionally the AR in the Moreh region alone has seized contraband of approx Rs 1100 Cr in the past five years. In the same duration and location, it was with the persistent efforts of AR that 76 insurgents were apprehended/surrendered along with weapons before being handed over to the State Police.In the context of Moreh, the internal-security situation remains stable, allowing  the State Government to exercise its authority effectively. Blaming the Assam Rifles, whose primary role revolves around border guarding, for issues related to internal law and  order is an oversimplification of a complex matter presumably with an ulterior motive by novices in matters of internal security. Responsible journalism should refrain from laying blame on external entities and instead focus on addressing challenges collaboratively, recognising the shared responsibilities in maintaining law and order.Yours faithfully,Lieutenant Colonel Aabha KS, Staff Office (Public Relation & Media)"

Since most of the Government schools were converted into transit camps for the displaced people and/or the Central Armed Police Forces and thus, remained closed for more than 04 months, adolescents are struggling hard to resume their life normally. This study aimed to find and analyse the prevalence of Stress, Anxiety and Depression among the adolescents because of the ongoing Meitei-Kuki ethnic clashes in Manipur. The objectives of the study are:1. To analyse the difference in levels of Stress, Anxiety and Depression amongst the adolescents displaced/living in affected areas as compared to those living in non-affected areas.2. To identify the association, if any, between Stress, Anxiety and Depression among these adolescents, and3. To identify the difference in levels of Stress, Anxiety and Depression with reference to gender of these adolescents.HYPOTHESIS1. There will be significant difference between the level of Stress, Anxiety and Depression experienced by adolescents displaced/living in affected areas of ethnic clashes as compared to those living in non-affected areas of ethnic clashes.2. There will be a relationship between the prevalence of Stress, Anxiety and Depression experienced by the adolescents displaced /living in affected areas of ethnic clashes and those living in non-affected areas of ethnic clashes3. There will be difference in levels of Stress, Anxiety and Depression experienced by the adolescents displaced/ living in affected areas of ethnic clashes as compared to those living in non-affected areas of ethnic clashes with reference to gender.VARIABLES UNDER STUDYThe impact of two experimental variable, that is, Impact of Ethnic Clashes and Gender on three dependent variables i.e., namely Stress, Anxiety and Depression among the adolescents sample population in Manipur was studied and analyzed.MATERIALS AND METHODParticipants : An objective, cross sectional study was conducted to analyse the prevalence of Anxiety, Depression and Stress among adolescents of Manipur Statea. who have been victims of ethnic clashes between Meitei and Kuki tribes from different districts of Manipur and as a result had to be housed at Relief Camps in the Imphal Valleyb. who are living in non-affected areas of the State, predominantly the Imphal Valleyc. who were studying in senior /secondary schools before their displacement in classes IX-XII in Manipur.d. who are studying in different Senior/ Secondary schools in classes IX-XII in ManipurSample. A total number of 138 adolescents belonging to various tribes and communities from the state of Manipur participated in the study. These participants belong to the age group of 14 -16 years of age and are studying in classes IX-XII. Out of the total 138 participants, 70 number of participants are male and 68 number of participants are female.Measures/Tools used.  The scale used for the study was the Anxiety, Depression and Stress Scale (ADSS) developed by Pallavi Bhatnagar, Megha Singh and others published through National Psychological Corporation Agra, India.General Description of ADSS: It is a self-administrable test that measures the Anxiety, Depression and stress experienced daily by the human beings of the age group 14 years -70 years. It can be administered on an individual as well as a group. The test consists of a total number of 48 items divided into three subscales. Higher scores indicate Greater Anxiety, Depression, and Stress and vice-versa. The reasons for choosing this scale to measure Anxiety, Depression and Stress among Adolescents area. its suitability for Indian populationb. unique ability to assess all three mental states (Anxiety, Depression & Stress) into a single scalec. its high applicability due to being bilingual and being accessible to both literate and illiterate populationd. its suitability as both a diagnostic as well as rating scalee. its generalizability (due to use on both clinical and non-clinical samples),f. its equally high Reliability and ValidityMethod.The Nodal Officer for Relief Camps in Imphal Valley was approached and due permissions from the parents were sought to administer the ADSS questionnaire to their wards falling in the age group of 14-16 years of age. Similarly, permissions were sought from Principals of various schools and colleges. Once permissions were accorded, conduct of test according to the convenience of the inmates of relief camps and the school authorities was held.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONData Collection Procedure & Data AnalysisData Collection: Sample: The study was conducted on a total of 138 adolescents studying in classes IX-XII in different schools of Manipur. Out of total 138, 70 were Male and 68 were Female. A total of 18 samples were discarded due to incorrect and incomplete filling of responses. After filtering out the irrelevant samples, the final number of samples (total 120; 60- male, 60-female) were considered for the study from affected areas and non-affected areasStatistical Analysis: The results of the test was then fed in MS Excel sheets and tabulated before treating it by descriptive statistics methods to obtain the significant differences and correlation between the three sub-scales among the adolescents from the affected and non-affected areas. The website DATA tab was referred to for obtaining the Mean, mode, median, variance, Standard Deviation, t-test results, 95% confidence interval of mean and Pearson’s Correlation coefficient of the data.Table I (a), (b), (c): Significant difference in levels of Anxiety, Depression and Stress in adolescents displaced/living in Affected Areas of Ethnic Clashes as compared to those living in Non-Affected Areas of Ethnic ClashesDiscussionThis study was conducted to find out the effect of ongoing Meitei-Kuki ethnic clashes on mental health of adolescents in Manipur and to analyse if there is any other factor such as gender that influences their mental health.With the help of the ADSS developed by Pallavi Bhatnagar and others, the levels of three sub scales of mental health namely Anxiety, Depression and Stress amongst a sample of 60 adolescents displaced or living in affected areas were analyzed in comparison with a sample of 60 adolescents living in non-affected areas of Manipur.A look at results displayed in Table I (a), (b), (c) and Graph 1, shows a comparison between the Mean, Standard Deviation and levels of Anxiety, depression and Stress experienced by the adolescents displaced/living in affected areas and the adolescents living in non-affected areas. This, in turn, proves that First Hypothesis: there will be significant difference between the level of Stress, Anxiety and Depression experienced by adolescents displaced /living in affected areas of Ethnic Clashes as compared to those living in non-affected areas of EthnicCONCLUSIONThe findings of this study have proven that the mental health of adolescents has been adversely affected by the ongoing ethnic clashes in Manipur. There is a significant prevalence of Anxiety, Depression & Stress amongst adolescents in Manipur due to the ongoing ethnic clashes in Manipur. The levels of Anxiety, Depression and Stress are significantly higher in the adolescents displaced/living in affected areas as compared to the adolescents living in non-affected areas. Also, within the adolescents displaced or living in affected areas, the female adolescents have shown significantly higher levels of Anxiety, Depression and Stress as compared to the Male adolescents displaced/living in affected areas.It is felt that timely counselling, guidance, and encouragement for participation in academic and co-curricular activities would go a long way to improve the mental health of the adolescents who have been either displaced or living in affected areas of Manipur."

The-silence-bordering-on-indifference-is-astounding-and-so-while-Manipur-continues-to-burn-for-more-than-9-mon,"The silence bordering on indifference is astounding and so while Manipur continues to burn for more than 9 months on the trot, New Delhi seems to be under the impression that some measures such as the decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) and fencing the Indo-Myanmar border will do the trick. As noted in an earlier commentary here, the two measures are fine and should help in curbing future incursion from across the porous border, but Delhi has not yet given even a hint that some of the major points raised would be  addressed soon. What Manipur wants is a commitment that all illegal immigrants would be identified and marked out. Experts have pointed out that deporting them may just fall short of acceptable international norms as the question of whether they would be acceptable to the host country hangs heavy, but this is not the time to go into the debate of usage of terms. The central agenda should be to identify the illegal immigrants, mark them out and ensure that they do not get to enjoy the entitlements of genuine citizens of the land. The Government seems to be more concerned with fixing the base year of identifying the illegal immigrants at 1961 while different civil society organisations have pitched in for 1951. This again should not be of much importance, for the bigger agenda should be to identify and mark out the illegal immigrants. This is where one may question what steps Imphal has taken up to respond to the opinion sought by the Centre on whether the nomadic Chin Kuki should continue to enjoy the facilities provided to the Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution of India. The query has been raised from New Delhi on the basis of the argument put forth that the Chin Kukis are not indigenous to the land with many questioning their status as legal citizens of the land. In the same vein, questions may also be raised on where Imphal exactly stands on the intimation from the Centre to send the needed socio-economic report of the Meiteis vis-a-vis the demand raised that the Meiteis be included in the ST list of the Constitution of India. The said intimation was sent in 2013 and this is where questions ought to be raised on where the State Government stands on the matter. As suggested many times in this column, the time is more than opportune for the Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee, Manipur, the World Meetei Council, the Meetei (Meitei) Tribe Union and others to make the ST for Meiteis demand a major issue when the next Assembly election comes around. This point may also be raised in the run up to the coming Parliamentary election.It also time for Imphal to seriously question where New Delhi stands on the demand that a National Register of Citizens be implemented here. This should be a natural follow up to the decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and do away with the Free Movement Regime. Doing away with the FMR and fencing the border without an NRC would not wholly address the problem of illegal immigrants in Manipur. This is not the time for the Government of Manipur to rest easy for there are lots to be done. The question is whether the State Government is in the position to raise these issues effectively before New Delhi or not. Abrogate the Suspension of Operation pact is another call that was raised audibly during the earlier days of the violence and clash, but today this is not as audible as desired. This reminder is in line with the fact that the SoO pact is set to expire by the end of this month and while there is nothing to indicate that New Delhi may abrogate the pact, there is no reason why the cry to call it off should go silent. This is where Imphal may step in and see if it can convince New Delhi to take another hard and close look at SoO and accept the fact that the pact was signed with outfits which have never waged a war against the security personnel. This is where questions have been raised on the reason for inking the pact in the first place and with no answer all these years, this has only given room for conspiracy theories to fly thick and fast. Manipur has burnt long enough and while the silence of the Prime Minister seems set to continue, there is no reason why Imphal should not put up the case of Manipur more forcefully and more effectively."

Thus, he urged people to make efforts to consume the iodine present in cooking salt and spread awareness about the health problems caused by iodine deficiency.Meanwhile, other speakers at the event addressed the importance of iodine in diet and for health. They also advised the public to only buy iodized salt with the symbol of a smiling sun. In order to retain the iodine from salt in the curry/dishes, the speakers urged people to add salt towards the end of cooking."

Agartala-Mar-2Union-Home-Minister-Amit-Shah-said-on-Saturday-that-the-Centre-has-resolved-a-large-number-of,"Agartala, Mar 2Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that the Centre has resolved a large number of problems in the northeastern States and made the region violence and insurgency-free, while over 10,000 militants from various outfits have shunned the path of violence and surrendered before the Government.Addressing the tripartite meeting between the Home Ministry, Tripura Government and leaders of the opposition Tipra Motha Party (TMP) in the National capital, the Home Minister said that various accords were signed with many militant outfits in the Northeast to restore peace and accelerate all-round development and welfare of the region.The accords signed with various militant outfits and other organisations include the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), Bodo, National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), Dimasa, Karbi, Adibasi, and Reang tribes.Besides, inter-State border problems in Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have also been resolved, he said.The Home Minister said that with the signing of the accords and resolution of the problems, development in the Northeastern region has accelerated.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a developed India would also develop the Northeast region and Tripura. The Government of India is always sincere in upholding the rights of the tribals and the people of the Northeast,” Shah said.The Home Minister also thanked the erstwhile kings of Tripura for settling the people who migrated from then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.The tripartite agreement was signed on Saturday in Delhi between the Centre, Tripura Government and the Tipra Motha Party (TMP) to provide more empowerment to the State’s tribals, who constitute one-third of Tripura’s four-million population.Meanwhile, the TMP, which has been demanding 'Greater Tipraland' or a separate State for the tribals under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, is continuing with its demonstrations since February 28 at Hatoi Katar (Baramura) on National Highway-8, the lifeline of Tripura.The TMP is demanding further strengthening of the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC), protection of the constitutional rights of the tribals, direct funding to the tribal autonomous body, and further modification of the tribals’ land rights.Tripura Chief Minister Manik Saha, Tribal Welfare Minister Bikash Debbarma, Tribal Welfare (TRP and PTG) Minister and Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) leader Sukla Charan Noatia, senior TMP leader Animesh Debbarma, TTAADC Chairman Jagadhish Debbarma, TMP President Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl and other leaders went to Delhi on Friday night to attend the meeting.The IPFT, a tribal-based party, is an ally of the ruling BJP in Tripura.TMP supremo and former royal scion Pradyot Bikram Manikya Deb Barman and other party leaders have been camping in Delhi since February 28.Deb Barman had earlier claimed that he was called by the Central Government to Delhi to discuss their demands.“What we are asking is as per the Constitution. We want the Government to fulfil the tribals' constitutional and land rights-related issues,” the TMP chief had told the media.Former Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb, Chief Secretary JK Sinha and senior MHA officials also attended the tripartite meeting in Delhi.Ever since the TMP wrested power in the politically-important TTAADC in April 2021, the party has intensified its agitation in support of the ‘Greater Tipraland’ demand, which has been strongly opposed by the ruling BJP, the opposition Left Front, Congress, Trinamool Congress and other parties.The TTAADC, which has a jurisdiction over two-third of Tripura's 10,491 sq km area, and is home to over 12,16,000 people, of which around 84 per cent are tribals, is, in terms of its political significance, the second most important constitutional body after the Tripura Assembly.The ruling BJP often tries to take TMP’s support to gain tribal votes, which constitute one-third of the State’s 28.57 lakh voters.

Interesting-stage-one-may-say-The-Big-2-have-not-yet-announced-their-candidates-either-in-the-Inner-Parliam,"Interesting stage, one may say. The Big 2 have not yet announced their candidates, either in the Inner Parliamentary Constituency or the Outer Parliamentary Consti- tuency but this has not stopped numerous ‘poll pundits’ from coming forward and sharing their thoughts and ideas, all based on speculations. And perhaps no other Lok Sabha election has elicited as much interest as this time around and one just has to look back at 2019, 2014, 2009 and 2004 in the current millennium to get an idea of the point that is being sought to be made here. This is particularly true in the case of the Inner Parliamentary Constituency and one does not need to look far to understand why this is so. The day for all voters to remember is May 3, 2023 and the days that followed thereafter and despite the mayhem, the deaths, the displacement of thousands, one positive that can be pinpointed is the realisation of the people that they are as much political beings as the professional politicians. It has also awakened quite a large number of people to the immense responsibility they have in sending their representative to the floor of Parliament and hence the talk seems centred around the ability, the professional expertise of the intending candidates, their background, their past conduct and this is something which Manipur badly needs at this point of time. One only hopes that this trend sustains for years to come and does not get blown away by the ‘enticements’ usually offered in the run up to any election. How were the interests of Manipur put forth before the audience during the height of the conflict is a question that each voter must ask himself or herself. How did the stand spelt out by the respective intending candidates go to deflate the false narrative that had been lapped up across the country during the initial days of the conflict ? In short how were the interests of Manipur succinctly put across the discerning folks of not only the country but across the world ? Remember the ethnic conflict had come up for discussion in the European Parliament. All these are immediate points that need to be kept in mind and much will depend on how the voters exercise their choice. It is also important for everyone to keep in mind that the button they push on the EVM on voting day will go a long way in how the interests of Manipur will be presented on the floor of Parliament. This is a point which should have ideally been raised in all the past Lok Sabha elections that Manipur has seen, but the need to reiterate this is not felt as much as now.Just five days to go for the nomination papers to be filed on March 27 and while the BJP and the Congress have not officially named their candidates, all plans must have been drawn up. It also stands that the candidate the BJP names can have a bearing on the ongoing ethnic clash and it is not likely for the Central leadership of the BJP to have missed this. How it goes about addressing this point remains to be seen but the prognosis of Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju some time back that the issue will be resolved after the Lok Sabha elections is significant. The hows and  whys ‘after the LS polls’ were not spelt out, but it is in the unspoken that so many possibilities can be read into, adding more interest in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections. As stated in an earlier commentary here, the Lok Sabha election will be a sort of a referendum on the BJP led Government at Imphal especially on its dealing with the ethnic clash and the steps it has taken up to address the grievances of the people. To the Congress, perhaps this is the best time to capitalise on the situation given that the violence has dragged on for 10 months and despite the deaths of over 200 persons, many missing, thousands displaced and houses razed and levelled to the ground, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not uttered a single word, other than the outburst when two girls were paraded naked in the initial days of the violence. Will the voters vocalise their stand against the silence of the Prime Minister is a point which the Congress will surely try to capitalise on. On the other hand the BJP too will capitalise on the suspension of the Free Movement Regime, the decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and the fact that the popularly elected Government has been allowed to continue despite the ten months old violence."
-Covid-19-deaths-in-India-largely-due-to-patients-reporting-late-at-hospital-Govt,"New Delhi, Dec 23Fewer patients are dying in India due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as compared to other countries, and deaths happen largely because patients are reaching hospital late, say experts in the Government.The country’s deaths per million population due to Covid-19 currently stand at 106, and the global figures show that 216 patients are dying of Covid-19 per million population in comparison.“The deaths are low in number and our analysis shows that most of the positive cases, who are serious, come to a hospital late; when their condition has fairly deteriorated. It is important to get tested and seek medical aid in time to avoid complications,” said Dr VK Paul, in Tuesday’s media briefing on Covid-19 update.India’s disease trajectory shows there has been a constant decline in both the number of new deaths and new cases reported daily.“In India we are seeing 7,300 cases per million population currently and global figures show 9,600 cases getting reported per million population. That goes on to show that the country has managed to control the disease quite well,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health Secretary.The comparison of past seven days’ data on Covid-19 cases per million showed that average daily new cases had declined from about 46,000 between November 4 and 10 to about 24,000 in the week between December 16 and 22.On Monday, India had reported less than 20,000 new cases after almost 173 days, and Health Ministry attributes the steady decline in numbers and deaths to sustained efforts at the ground level both from the Central and State Governments.“Teams of experts were sent to States that were reporting a higher caseload to assist Governments in managing the condition on ground. Experts would look for areas that needed special focus and drafted mitigation plans accordingly. All that has worked in bringing the numbers down overall, and the result is here for all to see,” said a senior Health Ministry official.“Having said that, there is absolutely no reason to drop our guards yet as there have been multiple waves of the disease already. The surveillance and other measures will continue along with people observing Covid-appropriate behaviour, which is absolutely necessary in curtailing the transmission rate,” the official added.Hindustan Times"

Dr-K-Rashbehari-SinghAnimals-have-played-a-significant-role-in-human-civilization-for-thousands-of-years-,"Dr K Rashbehari SinghAnimals have played a significant role in human civilization for thousands of years.    Human interaction with animals was first centered on getting animal products such as meat, hide, skin, dung, and bones, over time, human coexistence with these animals led to the beginning of their domestication. The propagation of domestic animals changed the usual perception of animal roles from being utility-based to companionship, hence, the idea behind the concept of pets, which provide companionship and pleasure. It is the companion- ship that nurtures attachment, and pets exhibit stronger attachment to their owners and often experience separation anxiety when they get separated from their owners.In our lives, so much love, joy, affection and humour were contributed by our pets and that human-animal bond may be deeply intertwined with our health and wellbeing. Our connections with our dogs, cats, birds, horses, etc., go deeper than words. These animals can sense our moods, and have the ability to bestow a joy and peacefulness in our lives.The human-animal bondThe human-animal bond is the connection between humans and companion animals.  The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) defines the human-animal bond as “a mutually beneficial relationship between people and animals.” Behaviours essential to the mental, physical, and social health and wellbeing of both influenced the bond. The veterinarian’s role is to maximize the potential of this relationship and to promote the wellbeing of people and animals. The historical and scientific knowledge behind the human-animal bond provides a deeper understanding of the relationships between humans and animals and this will help the veterinary team better integrate the bond into clinical culture.Long before the advent of current animal-assisted therapies, animals have been used in therapeutic environments in areas such as psychology, physical development, and physiology.    In the 19th century, animals were assisting the blind, and Florence Nightingale alluded to the soothing and pleasure patients could gain from animal companionship. To address psycho- logical conditions such as depression and social/developmental conditions such as autism, animal-assisted interventions have been utilized.Human-animal interaction has been shown to influence blood pressure, heart rate, and hormones correlated with wellbeing and mental health including oxitocin, beta-endorphin, prolactin, phenylacetic acid and dopamine.Benefits of human-animal bondIn many ways, the human-animal bond benefits our pets. We love our pets, so, we make sure they are provided with food, shelter, medical care, entertainment, and affection.  Being a pet owner means taking care of another life, but what we may not realize is that our pet is taking care of us in return. Scientific research shows that pet ownership is associated with numerous physical and mental health benefits.Crisis situation managementFor the people experiencing crisis situations, the human-animal bond can have both positive and negative influences on their health. Crisis situations are short-term overwhelming situations that disturb an individual’s normal state, causing stress and social isolation. Homelessness, domestic violence survivor-ship, incarceration, and hospitalization are the key crisis situations relevant to the concept of human-animal bond. For the health of highly stressed or socially isolated people, the social support provided by pets is vital. Studies have indicated that people experiencing any of these crisis situations tend to be socially isolated and highly stressed, and that the social support provided by human-animal bonds can be pivotal for their health and coping. However, if a pet is left behind when escaping a crisis situation, negative cognitions associated with their pet’s safety can hinder a person’s recovery.In inhospitable environments, people experiencing homelessness have profound emotional connec- tions to their pets, and this social support is vital to their endurance. Animal intervention programmes have also illustrated that a human-animal bond can motivate inmates to reduce recidivism and inmate violence, while promoting the development of life skills, a sense of self, and healthy behaviours, which improve coping and recovery after leaving jail. On the other hand, pets are crucial supporters, confidants, and allies for domestic violence survivors.     Animal welfare/health organizations, prison systems, hospital systems, crisis support services and Government legislation should attempt to preserve and to strengthen human-animal bond for supporting the wellbeing, coping and recovery of people experiencing crisis situations.Mental healthAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, from the difficulties of being quarantined at home, job loss and economic uncertainty, people are facing mental health crisis. In such situation, pets can have a positive impact in our mental health and wellbeing.Pets can have a significant impact on quality of life and mental health. For those who lives alone or is otherwise socially isolated, pets help to relieve loneliness and increase socialization. Pets provide a sense of purpose and add meaning to their lives to older adults or others who live alone.(To be contd)"

Sir-I-am-writing-as-an-unemployed-youth-and-most-importantly-a-concerned-citizen-of-Sanaleipak-Through-th,"Sir,I am writing as an unemployed youth and, most importantly, a concerned citizen of Sanaleipak. Through this esteemed paper, I express my concern over the sad cause and effect of increasing non-employment in our State. This is one of the most serious problems in Manipur, which is not a natural calamity but a man-made disaster.However, I appreciate the Government’s steps in trying to solve the State’s unemployment problems by opening the gate of employment in various Government Departments of Manipur. This comes as a great relief to this otherwise disturbed State.Better late than never, the Government is trying very hard to mend the holes in the sinking ship through the recruitment process. Indeed, it is a very welcoming and commendable part of the present Government under able leadership to utilize the potential of the youths of Manipur.May the Government also succeed in doing so. However, the current Government has failed to look into one serious matter that has completely marred the face of the present Government.The actual objective that has compelled me to write this letter is my curiosity regarding the non-recruitment of Assistant Librarian, Librarian, or any other Library Professional post in school and college libraries for more than 25 years,Whereas other States like Assam, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, West Bengal etc. are recruiting every year for College Librarian, Higher Secondary School Librarian, Diet College Librarian, District Library Librarian, State Central Library Librarian etc. through competitive exam (Public Services Commission).Whereas in our State called Manipur, there was no recruitment for more than 25 years, there has been no open recruitment for the said.Hence, the citizens of Sanaleipak the unemployment youth of Library Professional are curious to know when the recruitment will take place? And request the authority to look into the matter, and address the concern of unemployment youth of Library Professional of Sanaleipak. As per the survey conducted and the result of the survey, 70% of the Govt College Librarian are un-trained professional or not meet the essential  qualification.Whereas as per the UGC Rules for the post of Assistant Librarian and Librarian of the College Library needs to be a Master’s Degree in the subject of Library and Information Science with NET, or PhD as a minimum qualification.As every intellectual person knows, Library is one of the most important institutions for every citizen, child, youth, old age, etc., and the Library is the backbone of educational institutions, but the present Government has failed to look into the matter.The Library professionals are eagerly waiting for recruitment in Govt. college library, but when and where only Government authority knows."
AMSU-hails-new-fee-order-lifts-ban-on-schoolsNow-Govt-rules-30-pc-fees-from-July,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Nov 8: The Department of Education (S) issued an order yesterday superseding its earlier October 5 order and directed all private and Government aided schools to collect 30 percent of the monthly fees from students from the month of July.The earlier October 5 order had allowed schools to  collect 30 percent of the monthly fees from students/parents from the month of April and it had drawn strong opposition from many student bodies including AMSU (All Manipur Students’ Union). Notably, AMSU had also banned several schools for collecting the monthly fees.Meanwhile, AMSU has welcomed the new order of the Department of Education (S) and urged all private and Government aided schools to strictly follow the order and collect the 30 percent monthly fees from July onwards.Speaking to media persons at its office at Dhanamanjuri College campus, AMSU’s secretary general, Bipinchandra Ahanthem said the union welcomes the partial modification of the October 5 order and expects all schools concerned to follow the new order.While the other terms and conditions mentioned in the October 5 order remain the same, the new order has changed the month from which the fees may be collected from the students. As per the latest order, 30 percent of the monthly fees are to be collected from the students starting July and schools have to pay 50 percent  salary to teachers from April, he said.He recalled that AMSU had earlier objected to the October 5 order as it would have given the parents and guardians of the students extra financial burden amid the pandemic that had closed almost all means of earning during the lockdown period.The union had started appealing schools not to collect tuition fees for the lockdown months since May. The October 5 order was met with strong opposition from the union and many rounds of talks with teachers and school authorities were held on the issue, he said.Further, the union has lifted the ban imposed on MEM Higher Secondary School, UNACCO School, Kindergarten Montessori School, COMET, Tiny Tots’ Unique School, Bright Foundation and Maria Montessori School as the institutions have taken up corrective measures, he said.It may be noted that AMSU had imposed temporary ban on several institutions for collecting fees from the students when there was a deadlock with the Department of Education (S) regarding the October 5 order."
NEW-DELHI-Dec-20-A-bill-allowing-the-government-to-temporarily-take-control-of-telecom-services-in-the-inte,"NEW DELHI, Dec 20 : A bill allowing the government to temporarily take control of telecom services in the interest of national security, and providing a non-auction route for the allocation of satellite spectrum was approved by the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The Telecommunications Bill, 2023, which was passed by a voice vote after a short debate, also allows the Centre to take possession of a telecom network in case of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety.The bill, piloted by Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, provides for stopping transmission and intercepting messages in case of public emergency, in the interest of the public, to prevent incitement for committing offence.""The bill will promote structural reforms in the telecom sector,"" Vaishnaw said.""On the occurrence of any public emergency, including disaster management, or in the interest of public safety, the central government or a state government or any officer specially authorised on this behalf by the central government or a state government, if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, by notification, take temporary possession of any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity,"" the bill said.According to the bill, the press messages of correspondents accredited to the Centre or state governments shall not be intercepted or detained unless their transmission has been prohibited under rules applicable to public emergency, public order etc.The bill provides for the allocation of spectrum to satellite communications companies through the administrative method, Vaishnaw said.The provisions of the bill, it may be mentioned, are in line with the demand of global satellite services companies and reject the argument made by domestic telecom players Jio and Vodafone Idea for allocation of spectrum for commercial use through the auction route.As per the bill, ""The central government shall assign spectrum for telecommunication through auction except for entries listed in the First Schedule for which assignment shall be done by administrative process.""The first schedule has 19 cases for which spectrum will be assigned through the administrative process including global mobile personal communication by satellites, national long-distance and international long-distance services, mobile satellite services, VSAT, In-Flight and maritime connectivity, BSNL and MTNL.

Overpowering-the-mighty-Indian-military-by-some-Kuki-militants-sounds-like-an-unrealistic-joke-But-it-is-a-re,"Overpowering the mighty Indian military by some Kuki militants sounds like an unrealistic joke. But it is a reality. Video clips of some Kuki militants threatening and forcing Indian military troops to turn back from their operational duty have already gone viral in social media. This unprecedented and bizarre incident took place in the border town of Moreh on January 17, 2024. All Kuki militant groups are insignificant in all aspects compared to the Indian military forces. Yet, the Kuki militants had their way and dictated terms in the border town of Moreh. Even after Kuki militants have gunned down a number of military and police personnel at Moreh and other places of Manipur since they launched a politico-military offensive in May 2023 to carve out an exclusive political domain for Kuki-Zo people at the cost of the united and pluralistic Manipur, Indian troops have showed no sign to rein in the rampaging militants. Kuki militants too knew very well the strength of the Indian military yet they flexed their muscles and dictated their terms. The military troops, on their part, thought it wise not to confront the Kuki militants. In another word, the Indian military has been dealing with the Kuki militants quite softly. This policy of handling the Kuki militants with velvet gloves has serious ramifications and repercussions. As a direct result of this policy or approach, Kuki militants are becoming bolder and bolder. In addition to attacking and ambushing police personnel repeatedly, Kuki militants laid siege to police camps of Moreh for days. They are openly challenging the state government, and any challenge to a government duly elected under the constitution of India is a threat to the national security. The Kuki militants declared war against the state by repeatedly attacking and killing police personnel. When any militant group declares war against the state, it is not merely a law and order problem but it is a national security issue.By letting themselves overpowered by a bunch of Kuki militants, the military only discredited themselves. The particular incident created a very bad impression among the citizens who always look to the military for protection when their lives and security are threatened. As pointed out by the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity, the visuals of the brave soldiers being openly threatened with guns, rocket launchers and other weapons have never been witnessed before and the incident not only undermines the integrity and authority of the armed forces but also poses a significant threat to the national security. Perhaps, the troops might have wanted to act but some unseen force or authority has been holding back their hands. Well armed militants threatening the military cannot be seen as a civil protest. Of course, there is the infamous Suspension of Operation or SoO agreement. But SoO agreement does not warrant Kuki militant groups to threaten and obstruct armed forces from performing their duties. Threatening armed forces is rather blatant violation of not only the ground rules but also the very foundation of the agreement. Whether the particular Kuki militants are a party to the SoO agreement or not, the armed forces had every reason to act but they did not. Emboldened by the particular incident of Kuki militants threatening armed forces and dictating terms, some groups even served an ultimatum recently to both the Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police of Churachandpur to leave all Kuki inhabited areas within 24 hours. The situation is no longer a law and order problem. It is now an issue of national security. In such situations, the military needs to step in. What is keeping the hands of the military tied? Is there a political reason for restraining the armed forces?  Perhaps, understanding the politics of restraining armed forces vis-a-vis Kuki militants’ aggression may be the key to resolving the Manipur crisis."

Toll-rises-by-3-recovery-rate-improves-to-83-78-pc,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Nov 8: Even as the State recorded three COVID-19 related deaths for the second day in a row, the recovery rate has improved to 83.78 per cent during the last 24 hours.According to a press release issued by Additional Director (Health) and COVID-19 Common Control Room spokesman Dr Khoirom Sasheekumar Mangang, two males aged 58 and 55 from Imphal West and one 75 year old man from Thoubal died of COVID-19.As per the bulletin issued by the COVID-19 Common Control Room, the death toll has reached 197 but this figure is exclusive of the three deaths reported from Shija Hospital some days back and published in The Sangai Express.During the last 24 hours, 245 people including three personnel of CAPF were tested positive for the contagion at JNIMS, RIMS, Imphal East, Imphal West, Maipakpi Hospital, Shija Hospital, Raj Medicity, RD Wing, Escent Diagnostics, Jivan Hospital, Advance Hospital, Christian Hospital, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kakching, Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Jiribam and Babina Diagnostics.The 242 civilians (123 males and 119 females) who have been tested positive belong to Imphal West (129), Imphal East (35), Thoubal (20), Bishnupur (40), Kakching (4), Kangpokpi (2), Churachandpur (9), Jiribam (1) and Kamjong (2). None of them has any significant history of travelling outside the State.On the other hand, 358 COVID-19 positive people were discharged during the last 24 hours from CAPF (26), home isolation (275), JNIMS (10), CCC Lamboi Khongnangkhong (8), CCC UNACCO (8), Sadbhavna (5), Kangpokpi (5), Chandel (1), Kakching (3), Bal Bhavan (7), Bishnupur (3), Tamenglong (3) and Thoubal (4).The cumulative figure of COVID-19 positive cases in the State is 20376 (general population 17548, Central security personnel 2828).It includes 3107 active cases (general population 2857, Central security personnel 250) and 17072 discharged cases (general population 14498, Central security personnel 2574).The recovery rate has slightly improved to 83.78 per cent."

IMPHAL-Oct-8-The-proscribed-PREPAK-Pro-has-categorically-stated-that-minimising-indigenous-people-to-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 8: The proscribed PREPAK (Pro) has categorically stated that minimising indigenous people to maximise the number of outsiders is the most dangerous policy of ethnic cleansing.According to a statement issued by PREPAK(Pro) Chairman L Paliba M on the occasion of the outfit’s 43rd raising day (October 9), Government of India has recently embarked on a new design of “Opium War” which allows a few person to openly manufacture and sell drugs in Manipur. Government also indirectly supports and gives incentives for cultivating opium, it alleged.Arresting and destroying some drug factories are being done but it is just like whitewashing people’s apprehension. While creating chaos among ethnic communities to promote disunity and conflict, indigenous people are being marginalized by drug related deaths and these cases are due to availability of drug on large scale Bellin the region, said the outfit.Now, Hindi language is forcefully imposed as everybody’s mother language. Many local leaders also overtly support this policy. Foreign culture conflated into indigenous traditions has caused degeneration of our society. Knowing the roots causing degeneration of our society, the State leaders should dedicate themselves to prevent it from further degeneration, the outfit asserted.The objectives of Indian policies on education, culture and human resource development are to dominate the ethnic minorities.“We need to resist these hegemonic policies, for it is quite dangerous to our society”, Paliba said.Government of India has accepted the resolutions of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) but India redefines the Article 1 of ICCPR wrongly as “Right to Self Determination must be applied only to the peoples under foreign domination”.Manipur was never an integral  part of India, it alleged and added that the pressing matter of self determination of our people is the logical outcome as India annexed Manipur without any referendum.By allegedly colonizing Manipur, India has been bragging very loudly that the right to self-administration is incorporated by conducting five-yearly elections in Manipur. India-supervised election cannot be considered as a testimony of Manipuri people’s  willingness to join India. Such election has nothing to do with the right to National self-determination, Paliba asserted.The indigenous culture, religion, economic and social infrastructure of Manipur, are not being protected by the Indian Government. Rather, these infrastructure are forcefully being pushed into the Hindu domain and there is conspiracy to break the administrative and territorial boundary of Manipur. This socio-cultural domination is a violation of Vienna Declaration of 1993 and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), alleged the statement.It may be understood from the frequent expression of Indian leaders that they wanted a homogenous identity for India with all people speaking Hindi language and having the physical appearance of northern Indians, said the outfit further.Article 370 which was supposed to protect the rights and identity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated on the false logic that this Article will challenge integrity of India, alleged the outfit.“Now, we may assume that the provisions which empower the tribal people of North East India might be erased soon in future, as such special status would hamper the unification of India, considering the Government’s rhetoric regarding the abrogation of Article 370”, the Chairman continued.Minority ethnic people of the North East would be left without any future in India and it is sure that they will lose their identities so long as they live within India. If they want to live with dignity and protect their identity, then the only way and means is to separate themselves from India, added the statement.“We should not live in pipe-dream by expecting protection and goodness from the Indian political leaders and their Constitution. The best way to preserve our identity is to live separately as independent India and independent Manipur”, asserted the chairman.On the occasion of the outfit’s raising day, the chairman also offered revolutionary salute to all the people who have laid down their lives in the course of the liberation struggle and conveyed deepest regards to all the communities and fraternal revolutionary organizations."
Dying-Nambul-River-on-the-course-of-recovery-still-a-long-way-to-go,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Jul 4: After a gap of four/five decades, a boat ride was taken out on Nambul River which is closely associated with the history and civilization of Manipur.The boat ride was taken out on Thursday last as a part of a media campaign to save Nambul River. The media campaign  ‘Save Nambul River” was jointly organised by the AMWJU and the Directorate of Environment & Climate Change and it was supported by Editors’ Guild Manipur (EGM), Manipur Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Loktak Development Authority (LDA).The boat ride was flagged off from Khwai Thong and wrapped up at Yangoi Karong bridge.Six teams comprising of eight persons including two rowers each took part in the boat ride. Each team used two boats which were tied together. They were followed by two motorboats.Notably, Nambul River is formed by three streams namely; Abulok, Luwangli and Singda which originate from the Kangchup hill range.Nambul River is joined by Nambol River at Yangoi Karong. Starting from this confluence, the river is known as Yangoi River and it drains into Loktak Lake. The distance between Yan-goi Karong and Loktak Lake is around 4/5 Kms.Talking on the campaign, Environment & Climate Change Deputy Director Dr T Brajakumar said that Nambul River course was free from pollution some 50/60 years back and it was used as a waterway.However, the river became highly polluted during the last two/three decades. Nambul River was listed among the 350 most polluted rivers selected by the Government of India from across the country.It was so polluted, filthy and stinky that no people ventured into the river.Around 72 drains and canals fall into Nambul River. These drains and canals discharge effluents as well as solid wastes into the river. As such, they are the primary sources for pollution of Nambul River.The most polluted and filthiest section of Nambul River is from Iroishemba to Heirangoithong and these areas are ironically covered by Imphal Municipality, Dr Brajakumar said.One 90 year old man whom the campaigners met at Yangoi Karong said that the spot where a bailey bridge now stands was used as port or anchorage some 50/60 years back.Boats travelling along Yangoi River from Loktak Lake and boats travelling downstream on Nambol River were anchored at the particular spot, he said.People even used to transport paddy on boats on  Nambul River. People also delivered taxes (in kind) to the king by taking the Nambul River waterway, said the 90 year old man.Earthen pots were transported by boats till Thong Nambonbi for sale at Khwairamband market. At that time, the water of Nambul River was very clean.With the improvement in road infrastructure and introduction of different types motor vehicles coupled with pollution of Nambul River, the same river serving as a convenient waterway has become history, he added.Retaining walls have been built on both banks of the river from Khwai Thong to Keishamthong. IMC staff were also seen cleaning the river bank at this section. As such, the particular section looked neat and clean.The conservation work is being done under the Rejuvenation & Conservation of Nambul River which was launched in March last year. This project is funded by the Central Government and the Department of Environment & Climate Change is its nodal agency.In addition to Government departments/authori- ties, civil organisations and people settled along the course of Nambul River have also been contributing in conserving and rejuvenating the river. As compared to its condition seen a couple of decades back, many positive changes can now be seen in Nambul River. Yet,  disposal of waste materials, both solid and liquid, into the river can be seen even today.One of the occupants of the boat sailing before us threw down an empty plastic bottle into the river. Khwairakpam Krishnamohon (34) who was rowing our boat picked up the bottle and said that the very act of throwing plastic bottle into the river contradicted the very purpose of the boat ride.Together with Krishnamohon, Laishram Shyam (41) was rowing our boat. Both of them belong to Sendra.Krishnamohon said that  it is the upper section or the upstream where maximum pollution occurs.Plastic wastes and other waste materials brought down to Loktak Lake by Nambul River are so huge and appalling, he remarked.As told by Krishnamohon, many plastic wastes and thermocol sheets were found on Nambul River in the course of the boat ride.Many drains whose loads are dark and stinky fall into Nambul River.A land mass was found before reaching Heirangoithong and it hindered the boat ride for some minutes. Large heaps of biomass were seen entangled at Samushang Shantipur bridge but they did not pose any hurdle to the boat ride.Ahead of the boat ride, shrubs and bushes growing in the river bed were removed by MPCB using excavator and motorboats at the initiative of MPCB Chairman MLA L Radhakishore.With the people settled along the river course extending support and cooperation to the Government’s efforts to conserve and rejuvenate the river, it is slowly returning to its earlier self.But there are lots to be done before Nambul River is restored to its unpolluted condition."

MLAs of every Constituency will also be empowered and consulted to effectively implement the policy, he added.The Minister was speaking as chief guest at the reception ceremony organized by teaching and non-teaching staff of Pravabati College, Mayang Imphal.At the event, Rajen maintained that the Central Government has been focusing on improving the education sector and as such it had introduced the National Education Policy. For successful implementation of the policy, cooperation of intellectuals and other professionals is required, he added.Giving proper education to all children is a step forward to achieving the Nation’s goals. Unfortunately, the Government schools have not been able to perform well. One of the reasons for this is lack of dedication and sincerity on the part of the few who are responsible, he said.The Minister further stated that most of the parents and guardians prefer to send their children to private schools even when Government schools provide free education. The Government schools are even providing free meals to children apart from providing study materials including books, note books, pen, pencil etc. There are some loopholes in the administration which need to be corrected at the earliest, he said adding stringent actions such as warnings are needed to make the “non-performing” staff and officials of the Department realise their duties, the Minister added.Speaking as guest of honour, Deputy Speaker K Robindro Singh appealed the teaching and non teaching staff of Pravabati College to perform their duties with sincerity. To improve the infrastructure and other facilities of the college, the authorities concerned will be approached, he said.

Sir-On-3rd-May-2023-in-the-Kuki-inhabited-Churachandpur-district-Kuki-intruders-illegal-immigrants-drug,"Sir,On 3rd May, 2023, in the Kuki inhabited Churachandpur district, Kuki intruders, illegal immigrants, drug smugglers started burning houses and killing the innocent Hindu Meiteis, and other than the houses of the Meiteis many houses and properties of Tamils and Muslims residing in Moreh town of Tengnoupal District were burnt indiscriminately. These Kukis have done these  acts against humanity just to occupy an area for their separate administration and carry on their illegal activities hurting mankind. This mayhem started due to a decision of Government of Manipur to evict houses of illegal immigrants, intruders, drug smugglers from the Reserved Forest Area, destroying poppy plantations, strictly restricting drug smuggling, demanding National Register of Citizens (NRC).It is believed that  Kukis don't have any exact history of their own, their origin etc. Kukis are not indigenous to Manipur. They are foreigners who took refuge in our State. They have taken refugee funds three times dated 22nd April, 1959, 28th February, 1966, 7th July, 1969. They are illegal infiltrators, intruders, illegal immigrants. These illegal people are also drug smugglers. They dream of Kuki land in Manipur so that they can have another Golden Triangle. And they are searching for a piece of land anywhere in the world so that they can get included in the World Map and get an identity.War has been going on between Hindu Meiteis and the illegal Kukis. It is an external aggression, cross-border terrorism that was pre-planned which is a threat to National Security. The present Governor of Manipur has also stated that the armed group from Myanmar may also be involved in this war.In front of Indian Security Forces, Kukis burnt down houses and properties of Hindu Meiteis. Kukis have been attacking the innocent Hindu Meiteis with sophisticated automatic weapons and with bombs. Indian Security Forces are not taking any action against these illegal Kukis. We seek immediate help from you to save the Hindu community (Meiteis). Pull back all the Indian Security Forces from Manipur. We Hindu Meitei will fight till our last breath with these Kuki infiltrators, intruders, illegal immigrants, drug smugglers for the sake of our future Manipur, for the sake of our future Bharat.In the whole NE Mongoloid State of India, Meiteis are the only Hindu. We Mongoloid Meitei stay in the Border State of India far away from the mainland. Do Aryans in mainland India don’t consider us as Hindus ? You want only the land of Manipur, you don’t love the Mongoloid Hindu Meiteis. Why should we be proud of being Hindus ? Why should we be proud of being Indians ? Being head of the world’s largest organisation and one of the most powerful Hindu organisations why have you been a silent spectator ?Yours faithfully,Konjengbam Candle,Tera Keithel,Imphal."
Shahnaz-HusainThe-most-awaited-summer-festival-is-upon-us-Holi-is-here-and-the-excitement-is-at-an-all-ti,"Shahnaz HusainThe most awaited summer festival is upon us !Holi is here and the excitement is at an all-time high because of all the fun that comes along with it. Holi holds a special place in everyone’s heart.The sacred festival brings an opportunity to connect, rejoice and rejuvenate. Down the ages, people have been delighted to splash colours on their near and dear ones to celebrate the occasion with gaiety and fun. The use of colours during Holi is not just for fun. The traditional Holi colours were extracted from plants like turmeric, neem and Palash and therefore had several positive health benefits.To make sure that Holi 2024 is the happiest for you, here are a few tips.Young babies have very delicate skin and immature immune systems. It is best not to put any colours on babies younger than six months because of their delicate skin. A red sandalwood tika should be enough to symbolically celebrate the festival.We often do not pay attention to the protection of our eyes while playing Holi.Avoid wearing contact lenses. The harsh chemicals can cause an infection by smearing your lens. Wear sunglasses/goggles to avoid any sort of optical injuries from any misfired water balloons and to prevent colours from coming in contact with the eyes. Avoid touching your eyes while playing Holi. Do not rub your eyes ! Rubbing can aggravate the problems further.Dress yourself and your kids in full-sleeved clothes to create one more barrier between your skin and the colours.Moisturizing skin with a natural oil-based moisturizer before heading out to play with colours is very important for a smooth, supple and healthy skin. This creates a barrier between your skin and the colours. It also helps the colours to be taken off easily upon washing.Remember to apply sunscreen 20 minutes before going out in the sun. Use a sunscreen of SPF 20 and above on the neck, arms, and whichever part of your body is exposed to the sun.    If your skin is prone to pigmented patches, select a higher SPF. Most sunscreens have built-in moisturizers. If your skin is very dry, first apply the sunscreen, wait for a few minutes and then apply a moisturizer. Apply moisturising lotion or cream on the arms and exposed areas.Apply leave-on conditioner or hair serum on hair before playing Holi. Oil your hair or wear a bandana/scarf/cap to cover your hair.Hair Cream containing sunscreen is also available in the market. Take very little, spread on both palms and massage light into the hair, or smooth palms over the hair. Or, apply pure coconut oil/mustard oil and massage it lightly into the hair. Oil will make sure your hair doesn't get too dry and the colour also does not go deep into your hair, causing breakage and dryness. This also provides protection against colours.You’ll need to protect your nails too ! Paint your nails with two coats of good quality nail paint to prevent your nails from getting stained. This helps to protect the nails from absorbing Holi colours.The real problem is the removal of colours after playing Holi. Rinse the face with plenty of plain water and then use a cleansing cream, or lotion. Apply and massage it on the face. Then wipe off with moist cotton wool. Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too, using a light touch. A cleansing gel helps to dissolve the colours and facilitate their removal.To make your own cleanser, take half a cup of cold milk and add one teaspoon of any vegetable oil, like “til,” olive or sunflower oil. Mix well. Dip cotton wool into this mixture and use it to cleanse the skin.Use ubtan, a pack made with gram flour, curd and turmeric to remove the colour from your skin gently. This pack will not only help to reduce the colour of your skin, but it will also nourish it in the process and keep the damage away.Sesame seed (til) oil can be used to remove colours from the body, massaging it on the skin. This not only helps to remove the colours, but gives added protection to the skin. Sesame seed (til) oil actually helps to counteract sun-damage. While bathing, scrub the body gently with a loofah or wash cloth. Immediately after your bath, apply a moisturizer on the face and body, while the skin is still damp. This helps to seal in moisture.If there is itching, add two tablespoon vinegar to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse. This helps to reduce itching. However, if the itching continues, and there is rash and redness, there may be an allergic reaction to the colour. Consult a doctor as soon as possible.While washing the hair, first rinse with plenty of plain water to wash away the dry colours and tiny particles of mica. Then apply a mild herbal shampoo, working it into the hair with the fingers. Massage the scalp gently and rinse thoroughly with water again.Beer can be used as a last rinse. It will soften and condition the hair. Add the juice of a lemon to the beer. Pour over the hair after shampooing. Leave on for a few minutes and rinse off with plain water.The day after Holi, mix two tablespoon of honey with half a cup of curd. Add a pinch of turmeric. Apply this on the face, neck and arms. Leave it on for 20 minutes and wash it off with water. Helps to remove tan and soften the skin.Within the next few days give your hair a nourishing treatment. Mix one tablespoon of pure coconut oil with one teaspoon of castor oil. Heat and apply on the hair. Then dip a towel in hot water, squeeze out the water and wrap the hot towel around the head, like a turban. Keep it on for 5 minutes. Repeat the hot towel wrap 3 or 4 times. This helps the hair and scalp absorb the oil better. Wash your hair after an hour.Avoid travelling to overcrowded places if you have any chronic respiratory diseases, and celebrate safely at home.The author is an internationally famed beauty expert and is called the Herbal Queen of India"

It-is-unfortunate-and-hard-to-accept-that-even-after-more-than-10-months-of-the-ethnic-clash-erupting-on-May-3,"It is unfortunate and hard to accept that even after more than 10 months of the ethnic clash erupting on May 3, 2023, New Delhi continues to stick to the wrong narrative that the violence erupted because the Manipur High Court ‘recommended Scheduled Tribe status to the Meiteis’. This is the line maintained by Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju in a talk with NDTV on March 7, 2024 and while his stand that dialogue is the only way forward is acknowledged, it is disappointing to see that the Union Minister is still under the impression that the High Court recommended the inclusion of a community in the ST list of the Constitution of India. To set the record straight, what the High Court of Manipur ruled was that the report or recommendation sought by the Union Tribal Ministry on the inclusion of the Meiteis in the ST list must be submitted within three months from the day the order was issued. Everyone knows that it is beyond the Judiciary to include a community in the ST list and it is only Parliament which can do that. While this was something deliberately or otherwise overlooked by the All Tribal Students’ Union, Manipur (ATSUM) while going ahead with the Tribal Solidarity March on May 3, 2023,  it should have been clear that what the High Court did was to direct the Government of Manipur to send the report, a report which was sought by the Centre back in 2013. It was just an order asking the State Government to send the report sought by the Centre and not an order that the Meiteis be included in the ST list. This is where the hollowness of the claim that the clash erupted over the ST for Meiteis demand and the directive of the High Court should be called out. The Sangai Express has been consistent in its stand and the clash that erupted on May 3, 2023 is far removed from the demand that the Meiteis be included in the ST list and one wish that New Delhi too come around to this idea, if the first, meaningful step towards normalcy is to be taken. And this is primarily one prominent reason why the clash has continued for over 10 months on the trot. Open your eyes and see things for what it is, is the one line suggestion that may be offered to New Delhi or anyone in the quest for normalcy to return and it makes no sense in trying to shift the onus on the ruling of the Court.Even as the false narrative continues, it is also interesting to note Union Minister of State for Education and External Affairs, Dr RK Ranjan Singh pointing fingers at ‘some few political leaders, a handful of armed groups and wrongly motivated scoundrels’ for the unrest to continue. This is all that more significant given that these points were given in writing to no one less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How seriously the Prime Minister would have taken the written communication remains to be seen, but in one line the Union Minister of State has done what many would have found difficult to muster the courage and conviction to put three groups of people in the same bracket vis-a-vis the ongoing clash-’some few political leaders, a handful of armed groups and wrongly motivated scoundrels.’ Dr RK Ranjan has not taken names but many would have started reading between the lines, trying to decipher the unsaid part. This is where it would be interesting to see how and when Delhi would respond, that is if the Prime Minister takes the words of his Minister seriously enough. Wrongly motivated is par for the course but qualifying this with the word ‘scoundrels’ is significant and many would not have expected the mild mannered and soft spoken RK Ranjan to use such a term but it reflects a degree of angst and disillusionment. Folks on either side of the clash divide may read the words, ‘some few political leaders, a handful of armed groups and wrongly motivated scoundrels‘ differently and how the Prime Minister respond to this is something that may never be spelt out, but which may come in later developments in which it would be difficult to put a finger to. Perhaps things may become clearer once the Lok Sabha election is held."
Feb-21-Scientists-have-successfully-cured-a-third-person-of-HIV-The-man-codenamed-the-Duesseldor,"Feb 21Scientists have successfully cured a third person of HIV. The man codenamed ""the Duesseldorf patient"" was cured of the life-threatening disease after receiving a stem cell transplant, which also treated his leukaemia.Previously, two other patients have been cured following the high-risk procedure. The patients in Berlin and London were also suffering from the two diseases.Details of the latest success story, aka, the Duesseldorf patient, have been revealed in the journal Nature Medicine.While the patient's name was not released, the study revealed that he is 53 years old and was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. Three years later, he was then diagnosed with a life-threatening form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia.As per the study, ""this third case of HIV-1 cure"" provides ""valuable insights that will hopefully guide future cure strategies"".In 2013, the Duesseldorf patient underwent a bone marrow transplant using stem cells from a female donor that had a rare mutation in her CCR5 gene.As per AFP, this gene mutation has been found to stop HIV from entering cells.The patient celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the transplant on Valentine's day, where the donor was the ""guest of honour"".In a statement, he said that he was proud of his ""worldwide team of doctors who succeeded in curing me of HIV - and at the same time, of course, of leukaemia"".The bone marrow transplant used in this case is a severe and dangerous operation. Hence, it is only suitable for some special cases or a small number of patients suffering from HIV and blood cancer.Another challenge in this treatment is locating a bone marrow donor with the rare gene mutation.Wion"

Washington-Sep-9-Morocco-s-deadliest-earthquake-in-decades-has-killed-at-least-1000-people-officials-said,"Washington, Sep 9 : Morocco's deadliest earthquake in decades has killed at least 1000 people, officials said Saturday, causing widespread damage and sending terrified residents and tourists scrambling to safety in the middle of the night.The 6.8-magnitude quake struck a mountainous area 72 kilometres (45 miles) southwest of tourist hotspot Marrakesh at 11.11 pm (2211 GMT) Friday, the US Geological Survey reported.Strong tremors were also felt in the coastal cities of Rabat, Casablanca and Essaouira.""We felt a very violent tremor, and I realised it was an earthquake,"" Abdelhak El Amrani, 33, told AFP by telephone from Marrakesh.""I could see buildings moving,"" said Amrani who went outside, joining many other people, ""all in shock and panic. The children were crying and the parents were distraught.""It was the most powerful quake to ever hit the country, and one expert called it the region's ""biggest in more than 120 years"".""Where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough... so many collapse, resulting in high casualties,"" said Bill McGuire, Professor Emeritus at Britain's University College London.Updated Interior Ministry figures on Saturday showed the quake killed 820 people, more than one-third of them in Al-Haouz, the epicentre, and Taroudant provinces.The Ministry also recorded deaths in Ouarzazate, Chichaoua, Azilal and Youssoufia provinces, as well as in Marrakesh, Agadir and the Casablanca area.Another 672 people were injured, including 205 in a critical condition, the Ministry said.Frenchman Michael Bizet, 43, who owns three traditional riad houses in Marrakesh's old town, told AFP that he was in bed when the quake struck.""I thought my bed was going to fly away. I went out into the street half-naked and immediately went to see my riads. It was total chaos, a real catastrophe, madness,"" he said.Bizet shared video of piles of rubble from collapsed walls in the streets.Other footage on social media showed part of a minaret collapsed on Jemaa el-Fna square in the historic city.An AFP correspondent saw hundreds of people flocking to the square to spend the night for fear of aftershocks, some with blankets while others slept on the ground.Houda Outassaf, a local resident, told AFP he was walking around the square when the ground began to shake.""It was a truly staggering sensation. We're safe and sound, but I'm still in shock,"" he said.""I have at least 10 members of my family who died... I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago.""Fayssal Badour, another Marrakesh resident, told AFP the earthquake hit while he was driving.""I stopped and realised what a disaster it was... The screaming and crying was unbearable,"" he said.The Interior Ministry said authorities have ""mobilised all the necessary resources to intervene and help the affected areas"".The regional blood transfusion centre in Marrakesh called on residents to donate blood for those injured.In the town of Al-Haouz, near the quake's epicentre, a family was trapped in the rubble after their house collapsed, local media reported.- Significant damage likely -""We heard screams at the time of the tremor,"" a resident of Essaouira, 200 kilometres west of Marrakesh, told AFP.The USGS PAGER system, which provides preliminary assessments on the impact of earthquakes, issued a ""red alert"" for economic losses, saying extensive damage is probable and the disaster is likely widespread.Past events with this alert level have required a National or international level response, according to the US Government agency.Internet connectivity was disrupted in Marrakesh due to power cuts, according to global internet monitor NetBlocks.European leaders offered condolences, as did Russian President Vladimir Putin and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, along with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel which established diplomatic ties with Morocco in 2020, ordered ""any necessary assistance.""The earthquake was also felt in neighbouring Algeria, where the Algerian Civil Defence said it had not caused any damage or casualties.In 2004, at least 628 people were killed and 926 injured when a quake hit Al Hoceima in northeastern Morocco, and in 1960 a magnitude 6.7 quake in Agadir killed more than 12,000.The 7.3-magnitude El Asnam earthquake in neighbouring Algeria in 1980 killed 2,500 people and left at least 300,000 homeless.  AFP"

Silchar-Feb-24-The-Assam-Cabinet-on-Friday-gave-its-nod-to-recognise-Manipuri-as-an-associate-official-lang,"Silchar, Feb 24The Assam Cabinet on Friday gave its nod to recognise Manipuri as an associate official language in four districts by amending the Assam Official Language Act, 1960.Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma informed that the Cabinet has approved the Assam Official Language (Amendment) Bill, 2024, to recognise the Manipuri language in four districts – Cachar, Karimganj, Haila-kandi and Hojai.Sarma shared the information through a post on X. “In today’s meeting of the Assam Cabinet we took several historic decisions. Include Manipuri as an associate official language in 4 districts.”The decision taken at a late-night Cabinet meeting was in the interest of protecting, preserving and promoting the cultural, social, and linguistic identity and heritage of the Manipuri people living in Assam, Sarma said.“The Bill seeks to amend the Assam Official Language Act, 1960 by inserting a new Section 5B, which will provide for the recognition of Manipuri language as an Associate Official Language in the four districts,” the Cabinet decision read.The cabinet also decided to introduce primary education in six tribal languages – Mising, Rabha, Karbi, Tiwa, Deori and Dimasa. CM Sarma said that they are reframing the education structure in line with the provisions of the National Education Policy, 2020, to protect the interests of the tribal communities.“The decision will benefit students of the tribal communities by enabling them to study their language at the school level,” Sarma said.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh praised the Sarma for this decision. Taking to X, he wrote, “Many many thanks Himanta ji for including Manipuri as an associate official language in 4 districts of Assam. Your recognition and trust on the Manipuris is highly appreciated.”Three of the four districts where Manipuri will be the official associate language are part of the Barak Valley part of Assam, where the majority of the population is Bengali-speaking.Most of the socio-political organisations in Barak Valley have welcomed the government’s decision. The largest linguistic organisation in Barak Valley, Barak Upatyaka Banga Sahitya O Sanskriti Sammelan has appreciated the state government for this.However, they have also demanded recognition of Bengali as the state’s associate official language. The general secretary of the organisation, Gautam Prasad Dutta said, “We believe in respectful co-existence and we welcome this step.”Assam’s second most spoken language is Bengali and according to the 2011 census, 28% of the state’s population speaks the language.“Considering this, we appealed to the state government to recognise Bengali as the official associate language of the state. We are optimistic that the present government will consider this one day,” Dutta told HT on Saturday.The Manipuri organisations in Barak Valley are celebrating the announcement by distributing sweets. Many also offered special puja in various temples across the valley.Chief advisor of the All Assam Manipuri Students’ Union (AAMSU), Kamalakanta Singha, said they have been raising this demand since 1991 and after three decades Assam Government has recognised this.“We raised this demand in Hailakandi in 1991 for the first time. We kept fighting for this and many other organisations supported us. Finally, we have a reason to celebrate,” he said.Citing the 2011 census, Singh said that the Manipuri-speaking population is more than 200,000 in the state which has now crossed 300,000. “Manipuris are living in 13 districts in Assam but Cachar, Hailakandi and Hojai have the largest population,” he said.

TOKYO-Jan-28Japan-s-space-agency-said-Thursday-that-its-first-lunar-mission-hit-the-tiny-patch-of-the-moon-,"TOKYO, Jan 28Japan's space agency said Thursday that its first lunar mission hit the tiny patch of the moon's surface it was aiming for, in a successful demonstration of its pinpoint landing system—although the probe appears to be lying upside-down.Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the probe's solar batteries made it hard at first to figure out whether the probe landed in the target zone.While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). Improved accuracy would give scientists access to more of the moon, since probes could be placed nearer to obstacles.One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned.A pair of autonomous probes released by SLIM before touchtown sent back images of the box-shaped vehicle on the surface, although it appeared to be upside down.After a few days of data analysis, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA determined that the spacecraft landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, in between two craters near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rock.But after the landing mishap, the craft's solar panels wound up facing the wrong direction, and it cannot generate power. Officials said there is still hope the probe will be able to recharge when the moon enters its daytime in the coming days.JAXA project manager Shinichiro Sakai said the images sent back were just like those he'd imagined and seen in computer renderings.""Something we designed traveled all the way to the moon and took that snapshot. I almost fell down when I saw it,"" he said. For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a ""perfect score.""""We demonstrated that we can land where we want,"" Sakai said. ""We opened a door to a new era.""LEV-1, a hopping robot equipped with an antenna and a camera, was tasked with recording SLIM's landing and transmitting images back to Earth. LEV-2 is a baseball-sized rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy Co. and Doshisha University.The two autonomous probes frame and select images independently, both using LEV-1's antenna to send them back to the base.Daichi Hirano, a JAXA scientist who designed LEV-2, also known as Sora-Q, said it selected images containing SLIM and nearby lunar surface and transmitted the images through LEV-1, making the pair the world's first to achieve the mission. Despite the rush, the probes captured and transmitted 275 images.Japan followed the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India to reach the moon's surface.The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA.JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.SLIM, nicknamed ""the Moon Sniper,"" was intended to seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera.SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25.Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March. AP"

Elections in Kangleipak are held to befool the people that they are part of the decision making process but in reality this is a strategy to slowly erode the identity of the people.Elections sans the rule of law and its spirit can never bring anything good for the people, said the acting chairman and added that election is just another strategy to legitimise the continued occupation of Kangleipak.Under the sham of holding elections, the people are slowly and gradually being introduced to intoxicants, alleged the acting chairman of the outfit and added that such a policy has hit the daily wage earners the hardest, as it gives them the illusion that the everything will work out fine for the people.The acting chairman further said that today, the land is flooded with intoxicants and corruption has got a vice like grip on society. The people are increasingly being made to come under the impression that they cannot survive without the aid of others thus letting them develop the dependency mindset.It is to save the land and the people that the armed revolutionary movement was launched and the fight against the security personnel will continue until the lost sovereignty of the land and the people is restored, added the outfit's acting chairman.Volume 5 of Kangla Sempung contains the address of the acting chairman of PREPAK, the English edition of the same address, the address of the chairman of MAC given on the 39th Red Army raising day, editorial, a topic on today's youth, the peace talk between the NSCN (IM) and the Government of India, etc."

Aubaid AhmadIn the garden of the heart, where petals of emotion unfurl, love dances as a timeless melody, weaving threads of connection that transcend the boundaries of time and space. Each heartbeat a stanza, each sigh a verse, composing a symphony of pure devotion that resonates with the very essence of existence.Like a celestial choir, love sings its sweet refrain, echoing through the corridors of eternity, whispering secrets known only to the souls entwined in its embrace. It is a divine alchemy, blending the hues of passion and tenderness, crafting a masterpiece of sublime beauty that defies the constraints of mortal understanding.In the tapestry of life, love stands as a shimmering thread, weaving its way through the fabric of our existence, binding hearts in a sacred covenant of trust and understanding. It is a beacon of hope in the darkest of nights, a guiding light that leads us home to the sanctuary of each other's arms.Yet, in the tumult of modernity, the purity of love often becomes obscured, tarnished by the shadows of doubt and fear. In a world consumed by selfish desires and fleeting passions, it is easy to lose sight of the true essence of love—to mistake lust for longing, possession for devotion.But true love, ah, true love is a rare and precious gem, a treasure beyond compare. It is not found in grand gestures or extravagant displays, but in the quiet moments of tenderness and grace. It is a whispered promise, a silent vow, spoken not with words but with the beating of two hearts in perfect harmony.So let us, then, be guardians of love's purity, keepers of its sacred flame. Let us cherish each moment, each touch, each glance, as precious gifts bestowed upon us by the benevolent hand of fate. For in the sanctuary of love's embrace, we find not only solace but salvation—a refuge from the storms that rage outside, a haven of peace in a world gone mad.And as we journey through the labyrinth of life, let us remember always the timeless truth that love is eternal, love is pure, love is the very essence of our being. In its embrace, we find not only ourselves but each other, united in a bond that transcends the boundaries of time and space—a bond forged in the fires of passion, tempered by the gentle touch of grace.""In the end, it is love—and love alone—that will lead us home.""So let us embrace love, dear friends, with open hearts and open minds, for in its embrace lies the key to our salvation, the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let us be guided by its light, inspired by its beauty, and transformed by its grace. For in the end, it is love—and love alone—that will lead us home.About the Author:Aubaid Ahmad Akhoon is a distinguished Educational Columnist, Motivational Speaker, and Associate Editor of the weekly educational publication 'Education Quill.'The writer can be reached at[email protected]"
Newmai-News-NetworkDIMAPUR-Mar-21-NSCN-IM-chairman-Q-Tuccu-has-called-upon-the-Nagas-to-reflect-on-the-s,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Mar 21: NSCN (IM) chairman Q Tuccu has called upon the Nagas to reflect on the significance of the Naga Constitution and the values it upholds.This was mentioned in the speech of the NSCN (IM) chairman on the 45th Naga Republic Day celebration at Council Headquarters, Hebron near Dimapur today.Addressing the day, Tuccu said that the day is a great day in the history of the Nagas. “As we celebrate this historic day, let us take a moment to reflect on the significance of our Constitution and the values it upholds. Our Constitution is a beacon of hope, a symbol of our commitment to stand by our historical and political rights. Let us therefore, breathe the air of faith in our hearts and the memories of those who have shown us the way through their martyrdom. Let us salute the Naga Nation today and fill our hearts with pride and hope in our Almighty God who has sustained us giving us the courage to stand by our rights,” the leader added.Q Tuccu urged the Nagas to remember their patriotic leaders and give their gratitude to many people who fought for “our God given rights under the banner of our Flag”. He said the Naga Flag tells everything about the Naga Nation, the Naga identity that nobody can take away. “It is this Flag that brings us all together as a Nation. Let me remind you that from the day NSCN entered into political talks with the Government of India we made our stand very clear that no attempt should be made to bully the Nagas into submission,” he informed.“We took the bold stand to tell the Government of India that the blunder of history should not be repeated by introducing another 16 point type of solution,” said the NSCN leader.  Having taken such a stand, it is no doubt a tough negotiation all the way as the Government of India is desperate to have its way imposed on the Nagas, the NSCN (IM) leader said.“We stood the ground, not submitting to their self-centred and domineering narrative. Our perseverance was ultimately rewarded when the final breakthrough came in 2002 when the unique history of the Nagas and the situation was given official recognition by the Government of India. This changes the power dynamics of NSCN and boosts their morale. It was a turning point and milestone as the absolute truth of the historical and political rights of the Nagas was placed beyond the contestable spectrum”, he said.However, Tuccu said it took them more than a decade of tough talking to take forward the Indo-Naga political talks based on the unique history of the Nagas. “No wonder the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi demonstrated a high level of initiative to solve the Naga political issue to end the seven decades old Naga issue once and for all,” Tuccu said. Finally, the world was awakened when the high profile signing ceremony of Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015, was broadcast live on TV channels to make the world bear witness to the historic agreement, he recalled. “Significantly, this agreement made an indelible impact on the Indo-Naga political talks as we remained resolute to stand by Framework Agreement in the face of the flagging attention by the Government of India,” the NSCN (IM) chairman added.Q Tuccu further, “We are now in a situation where we must exhibit true political courage”. He also said NSCN is not ready to stand by and tamely accept defeat to surrender the rights of the Nagas. “Let us together carry on the essence of Naga republic beyond this moment. Let us exercise our duty to uphold the values as we continue with this timeless tradition as it symbolizes the achievement of Naga independence and the establishment of our Government to assert our political identity”.The NSCN-IM leader said the Naga Republic Day also highlights the democratic values and principles of the Naga Constitution which serves as the guiding document for the Nation. “May the flame of patriotism continue to burn brightly in the hearts of all Nagas,” he concluded."
Over-4-6-lakh-samples-tested-for-COVID-19,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Dec 18: Out of 4,60,665 samples tested for COVID-19 in the State since the outbreak of the pandemic, 27,540 were found infected by the virus.This was stated by Health Director Dr K Rajo during a weekly media briefing held at the Medical Directorate, Lamphelpat today.With more and more people opting for home isolation in case they get infected by COVID-19 and in view of the declining number of positive cases, the State Government has already decided to close down six COVID Care Centres, Dr Rajo said.Till December 17, the State recorded 332 COVID-19 related deaths while the total number of active cases was 1,872.The month of October witnessed the highest number of positive cases while maximum COVID-19 deaths were recorded in November, said the Health Director.Even though the recovery rate has now improved to 91.97 per cent  which means the fight against the virus has been effective.The Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Manipur Essential Services Maintenance Act 2010 were invoked to ensure that health care services are provided properly to the public. Disciplinary actions were initiated against some people who violated these Acts, Dr Rajo conveyed.After thermal screening of people at Mao Gate and Jiribam was discontinued since December 14, COVID-19 screening at Imphal airport was also stopped from December 17, he said.Although positive cases have been declining, COVID-19 positive people are still dying in the State. As such, awareness campaigns on COVID-19 (Jan Andolan) would go on till March 2021, Dr Rajo informed.He said that media took a major role in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in the State.State Surveillance Officer Dr N Somorjit informed that the serosurveillance work undertaken in four districts since November 30 is almost complete.Collection of samples to the targeted numbers has been completed for Imphal West, Imphal East and Kakching districts.

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Feb-28-MLA-Nishikant-Singh-Sapam-has-highlighted-that-Keisham-thong,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Feb 28: MLA Nishikant Singh Sapam has highlighted that Keishamthong constituency has been reeling under acute shortage of water since the drying up of Singda Dam, the main source of water for the constituency.The MLA made this observation in the course of discussing certain demands on the floor of Manipur Legislative Assembly today.Nishikant continued that Keishamthong AC is not only densely populated but also has a narrow drainage system.Saying most of the ponds in the constituency have also been covered except for a few private and public ponds and maintaining the water level of these limited number of ponds has become extremely difficult, he maintained that the people of Keishamthong AC are in distress due to non-availability of water and have been spending considerable amount of money on purchasing water from private tankers.Water is life, the MLA said and added that people may survive without good roads or power but water is indispensable for life .Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019 on seeing the hardship being faced by over  2.5 crore families in contemporary India who don't have access to clean drinking water facilities, Nishikant continued and  added that the objective of the mission is to provide clean water facilities to every citizen  by 2024.""I think there is fine coverage of Jal Jeevan Mission in Manipur,"" he said and maintained that he was elated to know that water from Chingkhei Ching has reached Keishampat and prayed for the success of the mission. He urged the Government to cover Keishamthong while laying the pipelines.Conveying that deforestation is the primary reason for drying up of water bodies, he appealed to the Government to award exemplary punishment to those who fell trees without any authorisation in hill districts and let people know about the consequences of rampant deforestation.""The water bodies will continue to shrink if there is no forest,"" he observed .Nishikant also acknowledged the many development projects taken up by the Government such as preparation to construct concrete roads in Imphal areas and the changes seen in the State over the couple of years.Saying that there seems to be lack of coordination between PHED and PWD while implementing projects at times, the MLA maintained that there were instances where roads had to be dug up due to lack of communications between the departments.Drainage systems at Dhobi Machu Leirak, Nganapi Thong, Thouda Bhabok Leikai, Haobam Marak and other areas in Keishamthong AC  have been clogged by the  pipes, he added. Expressing keen desire to develop Lamphelpat  where migratory  birds flocked occasionally as a tourist spot, he added that developing a big water body at Lamphelpat would go a long way in developing the site as a tourist destination."

Shahnaz-HusainThe-most-awaited-summer-festival-is-upon-us-Holi-is-here-and-the-excitement-is-at-an-all-ti,"Shahnaz HusainThe most awaited summer festival is upon us !Holi is here and the excitement is at an all-time high because of all the fun that comes along with it. Holi holds a special place in everyone’s heart.The sacred festival brings an opportunity to connect, rejoice and rejuvenate. Down the ages, people have been delighted to splash colours on their near and dear ones to celebrate the occasion with gaiety and fun. The use of colours during Holi is not just for fun. The traditional Holi colours were extracted from plants like turmeric, neem and Palash and therefore had several positive health benefits.To make sure that Holi 2024 is the happiest for you, here are a few tips.Young babies have very delicate skin and immature immune systems. It is best not to put any colours on babies younger than six months because of their delicate skin. A red sandalwood tika should be enough to symbolically celebrate the festival.We often do not pay attention to the protection of our eyes while playing Holi.Avoid wearing contact lenses. The harsh chemicals can cause an infection by smearing your lens. Wear sunglasses/goggles to avoid any sort of optical injuries from any misfired water balloons and to prevent colours from coming in contact with the eyes. Avoid touching your eyes while playing Holi. Do not rub your eyes ! Rubbing can aggravate the problems further.Dress yourself and your kids in full-sleeved clothes to create one more barrier between your skin and the colours.Moisturizing skin with a natural oil-based moisturizer before heading out to play with colours is very important for a smooth, supple and healthy skin. This creates a barrier between your skin and the colours. It also helps the colours to be taken off easily upon washing.Remember to apply sunscreen 20 minutes before going out in the sun. Use a sunscreen of SPF 20 and above on the neck, arms, and whichever part of your body is exposed to the sun.    If your skin is prone to pigmented patches, select a higher SPF. Most sunscreens have built-in moisturizers. If your skin is very dry, first apply the sunscreen, wait for a few minutes and then apply a moisturizer. Apply moisturising lotion or cream on the arms and exposed areas.Apply leave-on conditioner or hair serum on hair before playing Holi. Oil your hair or wear a bandana/scarf/cap to cover your hair.Hair Cream containing sunscreen is also available in the market. Take very little, spread on both palms and massage light into the hair, or smooth palms over the hair. Or, apply pure coconut oil/mustard oil and massage it lightly into the hair. Oil will make sure your hair doesn't get too dry and the colour also does not go deep into your hair, causing breakage and dryness. This also provides protection against colours.You’ll need to protect your nails too ! Paint your nails with two coats of good quality nail paint to prevent your nails from getting stained. This helps to protect the nails from absorbing Holi colours.The real problem is the removal of colours after playing Holi. Rinse the face with plenty of plain water and then use a cleansing cream, or lotion. Apply and massage it on the face. Then wipe off with moist cotton wool. Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too, using a light touch. A cleansing gel helps to dissolve the colours and facilitate their removal.To make your own cleanser, take half a cup of cold milk and add one teaspoon of any vegetable oil, like “til,” olive or sunflower oil. Mix well. Dip cotton wool into this mixture and use it to cleanse the skin.Use ubtan, a pack made with gram flour, curd and turmeric to remove the colour from your skin gently. This pack will not only help to reduce the colour of your skin, but it will also nourish it in the process and keep the damage away.Sesame seed (til) oil can be used to remove colours from the body, massaging it on the skin. This not only helps to remove the colours, but gives added protection to the skin. Sesame seed (til) oil actually helps to counteract sun-damage. While bathing, scrub the body gently with a loofah or wash cloth. Immediately after your bath, apply a moisturizer on the face and body, while the skin is still damp. This helps to seal in moisture.If there is itching, add two tablespoon vinegar to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse. This helps to reduce itching. However, if the itching continues, and there is rash and redness, there may be an allergic reaction to the colour. Consult a doctor as soon as possible.While washing the hair, first rinse with plenty of plain water to wash away the dry colours and tiny particles of mica. Then apply a mild herbal shampoo, working it into the hair with the fingers. Massage the scalp gently and rinse thoroughly with water again.Beer can be used as a last rinse. It will soften and condition the hair. Add the juice of a lemon to the beer. Pour over the hair after shampooing. Leave on for a few minutes and rinse off with plain water.The day after Holi, mix two tablespoon of honey with half a cup of curd. Add a pinch of turmeric. Apply this on the face, neck and arms. Leave it on for 20 minutes and wash it off with water. Helps to remove tan and soften the skin.Within the next few days give your hair a nourishing treatment. Mix one tablespoon of pure coconut oil with one teaspoon of castor oil. Heat and apply on the hair. Then dip a towel in hot water, squeeze out the water and wrap the hot towel around the head, like a turban. Keep it on for 5 minutes. Repeat the hot towel wrap 3 or 4 times. This helps the hair and scalp absorb the oil better. Wash your hair after an hour.Avoid travelling to overcrowded places if you have any chronic respiratory diseases, and celebrate safely at home.The author is an internationally famed beauty expert and is called the Herbal Queen of India"

Ngaranmi-ShimrayThe-Manipur-High-Court-has-stated-in-Review-Petition-No-12-of-2023-Ref-W-P-C-No-229,"Ngaranmi ShimrayThe Manipur High Court has stated in Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 [Ref. : W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023] that the offending para 17 (iii) is deleted. Hence the surviving and actionable point is only para 17 (ii) of the order passed in W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023. This para reads as follows:-“The first respondent is directed to submit the recommendation in reply to the letter dated 29.05.2013 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India.”The letter dated 29.05.2013 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India states as follows:-The State Government is requested to send “specific recommendation along with the latest socio-economic survey and ethnographic report.”Note the word “latest”. This means only one thing - to send the latest report at that point of time which is May 2013. Since then ten years had lapsed, the latest report should now be with reference to the current point in time i.e. 2024. Further, note that there are two reports (1) the socio-economic survey and (2) ethnographic study to be sent to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India and both should be the LATEST reports.The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) approach of pressurising the State Government to send specific recommendations for inclusion of Meitei Community in the list of Scheduled Tribe (ST) without carrying out socio-economic survey and an ethnographic study smacks of trickery to by-pass the order of the Manipur High Court.Assertions have been made by STDCM and Meitei researchers that there are several historical records to show that the Meiteis were termed as a tribe. Amen ! But the context of the issue is of the PRESENT TIME and not the PAST. The Meiteis may have been a tribe in the PAST, but are they still a tribe TODAY ? That’s the first question. Further, are the Meiteis a BACKWARD community? That’s the second question.To satisfy the Lokur Committee criteria an ethnographic study and socio-economic survey would be required to be carried out. The study and survey need to be conducted by an independent third party of repute and credibility whose reports should pass the test of impartiality and transparency. This is the most important requirement as the Meitei community is in majority and is the dominant community in Manipur. They control the State Government with 40 MLAs out of 60 and more than 65 percent Government employees. The Meiteis are therefore in a commanding position to influence researchers or institutions who are dependent on the State Government. Hence the importance of conducting the study and survey by an independent third party of repute and credibility is paramount.The operative part of the Manipur High Court order in Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 [Ref. : W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023] is very clear and there is no ambiguity in its interpretation. It does not matter how many times the demand was made by different organisations for inclusion of Meitei community in the list of ST and the number of communications exchanged between the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India and the State Government. The most important and relevant issue is the operative part of the Manipur High Court which mentions only the letter dated 29.05.2013 to be acted upon and responded by the State Government. The STDCM should be urging the State Government to proceed on the lines laid down in the Manipur High Court order.In respect of the Article written by LB Singh, retired Captain of the Indian Navy titled “Holistic review of Article 371-C and the Presidential Order 1972” in The Sangai Express on 6th March 2024, it appears that some relevant facts have been missed out by the author.For clarity and better understanding regarding the genesis of “Hill Areas” section 2 (f) of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act,1971 is reproduced below:-“(f) ""Hill Areas"" means the Hill Areas determined by the President by any notification issued under sub-section (2) of section 52 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 (20 of 1963) and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act;” It may be noted that under section 2 (f) of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971 a reference is made to section 52 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 (20 of 1963) which implies that the concept and area of “Hill Areas” existed under the Act of 1963. The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 has devoted an entire section i.e. section 52 granting “Special provision for the Hill Areas of Manipur.” The relevant part of section 52 relating to the provision for “Hill Areas” is reproduced below:-“52. (2) The President may by notification determine the area which shall be regarded as the Hill Areas of Manipur and specify the constituencies situated in the Hill Areas.” Section 1 (2) of the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 (Act No. 33 of 1960) provides that “2) It extends to the whole of the Union Territory of Manipur except the hill areas thereof.” Before this the Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act, 1956 under section 2 (d) defines hill areas as “”hill areas” mean such areas in the hill tracts of Union territory of Manipur as the Chief Commissioner may, by notification in the official gazette, declare to be hill areas”. Section 2 (h) of the Manipur Hill Areas (House Tax) Act, 1966 defines as follows:- “”hill areas” means such areas in the hill tracts of the Union Territory of Manipur as the Administrator may declare to be hill areas under the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960”It may be seen that reference to “Hill Areas” have already been made under sub-section (2) of section 52 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963; under section 2 (f) of the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Council Act, 1971; under section 2 (d) the Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act, 1956; and under Section 2 (h) of the Manipur Hill Areas (House Tax) Act, 1966. The term “Hill Areas” and the areas notified under the Acts are not newly conceived for Article 371-C but they existed much before the Constitutional amendment.For the sake of propriety and honesty it would serve the STDCM better if their demand for ST status for Meitei community is made by asking the State Government to conduct a socio-economic survey and an ethnographic study as advised by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India in its letter dated 29.05.2013 and reiterated by the Manipur High Court. There is no need to dodge and postpone the issue of having the ethnographic study and socio-economic survey conducted. Postponing the inevitable requirement to carry out the study and survey will keep the pot of uncertainty simmering and create more tension between the Meitei community and the tribals. The study and survey should be carried out immediately and should become the basis for justification of inclusion of Meitei community in the list of ST. The STDCM and the independent researchers K Yugindro Singh, M Manihar Singh & Sh Janaki Sharma (written Article published in the Ukhrul Times on 5th March 2024 and the People’s Chronicle on 6th March 2024 titled “Inclusion of ethnic “Meetei/Meitei” community in the ST List of Manipur under Article 342(1) of Constitution of India) should desist from hoodwinking and playing with the emotions of innocent Meitei masses by claiming that several historical documents show that the Meitei community was a tribe with tribal traits as the CONTEXT for consideration NOW is not what the Meiteis were in the PAST, but what the latest ethnographic study and socio-economic survey reports will say they are TODAY. The ethnographic study and socio-economic survey reports will show the current ethnic and socio-economic status of the Meitei community to justify whether they deserve to be included in the list of ST. There is no need to delay the inevitable by prolonging the tense situation in Manipur between the Meitei community and the tribals over the demand for inclusion of Meitei community in the list of ST.Procrastinating tactic will be harmful for the long term interest of the State. Why are the STDCM and State Government shying away from carrying out a latest ethnographic study and socio-economic survey ? Are they afraid that the truth will reveal that the Meiteis are NOT TRIBE NOW and are NOT BACKWARD ? The air of uncertainty should be cleared as soon as possible to facilitate the return of normalcy as far as the ST status demand by the Meitei community is concerned. The responsibility regarding this matter falls heavily on the shoulders of the STDCM and the State Government. They should have the courage to “BELL THE CAT”.It was advised EARLIER and is advised TODAY to the STDCM to pressurise the State Government to carry out an ethnographic study and socio-economic survey immediately without any delay as ordered and advised by the Manipur High Court and allow truth to prevail.Satyameva Jayate-‘Truth alone triumphs'.“To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is not, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true”-Aristotle"
Jerusalem-Oct-7-Over-40-Israelis-have-been-killed-and-more-than-700-injured-in-the-Hamas-offen-sive-that-be,"Jerusalem, Oct 7Over 40 Israelis have been killed and more than 700 injured in the Hamas offen-sive that began earlier on Saturday. Besides, more than 50 Israelis have been repor-tedly held hostage by the militant group.The group published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip on Saturday.The Gaza-based terror group launched an unprecedented assault on Israel in the morning, firing thousands of rockets and sending gunmen into Israeli communities by land, sea and air, killing at least 40 people and injuring hundreds, The Times of Israel reported.The multi-pronged attack, coming a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the surprise invasion on Yom Kippur, appeared to have caught the Israeli military and security forces completely by surprise.Hamas gunmen overran at least one military base and gunmen were moving through Israeli border communities, killing and cap- turing residents, apparently with little resistance from Israeli forces, residents were quoted as saying by the Israeli daily.Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group. Arabic media claimed 52 Israelis had been captured. Some of those captured appeared to have been killed, the report said.After the surprise attack, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-jamin Netanyahu said the country ""is at war"", and vowed to exact an ""unprecedented price from the terror group"".""Citizens of Israel, we are at war. Not an operation, not a round (of fighting,) at war. This morning Hamas initiated a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens,"" Netanyahu said.On the other hand, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 198 people have been killed and at least 1,610 wounded in the territory in Israel's retaliation after a wide-ranging Hamas assault into Israel.The toll came as Israel has carried out a number of airstrikes in Gaza and has clashed with gunmen at the border fence around the coastal territory.Agencies"

Sir-Shri-LB-Singh-had-mentioned-in-his-Letter-to-the-Editor-two-inaccurate-statements-appearing-in-my-a,"Sir,Shri LB Singh had mentioned in his ""Letter to the Editor"" two ""inaccurate statements"" appearing in my article titled ""Resolving Kuki-Zo-Chin and Meitei Conflict"" which appeared in your esteemed newspaper on 24th July, 2023.The alleged inaccurate statements were overruled as i)""...during the reign of Raja Nara Singh ... Manipur was not under British Colonial Rule"" and ii) ""... 'Reserved Forest' is not included in the Schedule to the Hill Areas Committee (HAC)."" To my mind, the issues rest clearly on how the facts are interpreted or appreciated.On the first point, after the Anglo-Burmese War of 1826, Manipur became a ""Protectorate"" of the British. Amongst the reasons why Manipur was taken to be a Protectorate State are issues like Gambhir Singh became Raja due to the British (see Anglo-Burmese Treaty, 1826), a Political Agent was imposed and posted in Imphal with an armed force, Manipur carried out all the biddings of the British like conducting surveys, building road into Assam, taking a force to assist the British in reducing an insurrection in the Khasi Hills, demarcating Manipur's boundary, etc. were all enforced and conducted by the British colonial power in Manipur. A Protectorate State is never truly an independent State.The second issue relates to the statement ... ""The 'Reserved Forest' is not included in the Schedule of the Hill Areas Committee (HAC)."" I had emphasised that The Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee), Order, 1972 cannot supersede Central Laws on the same subject. In fact Manipur's HAC law may now require an amendment due to a Central law i.e. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. As stated earlier, the issues are more in line with appreciations or interpretations, not a case of “inaccurate statements.""Kindly print this letter as it provides rooms for reasoning and understanding.Thanking you,Yours faithfully,Home Raikhan9007161952."
Sir-We-wish-to-address-the-article-published-in-The-Sangai-Express-on-06-August-2023-which-discusses-the,"Sir,We wish to address the article published in ""The Sangai Express"" on 06 August 2023, which discusses the activities of the Assam Rifles in the Pallel area. While we hold the media's role in informing the public in high regard, it is of paramount importance to present a well-rounded and accurate perspective on the events at hand.Pallel town of Kakching district is unique as in the current tumultuous times the area has remained a bastion of peace. Most likely it is the only place in Manipur where all communities reside together and no violent incident has occurred since 03 May 2023. The same is attributable to participation of communities in trust building meetings, cohesion between district administration, paramilitary forces, Indian Army and Assam Rifles.As mentioned in the aforesaid article, Assam Rifles has been organising peace talks between all communities and ensuring a safe and secure environment for all through commitment, untiring efforts and deployment all around the town & in buffer zones. Assam Rifles has maintained healthy communication with and within residents of Pallel Town and has made lot of efforts to ward off rumours and to normalise the sensitive situation.The article contains unsubstantiated claims aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the Assam Rifles by suggesting that their deployment is causing issues for civilians in Pallel. The deployment in the Kakching Area is essentially preventive in nature and is aimed at reassuring both the communities involved. The deployment also aims to create adequate reaction time for the Security Forces to prevent any escalation.The article raises concerns expressed by specific local group regarding construction of some additional bunkers by Assam Rifles. It's important to clarify that the structure referred to as ""bunkers"" was actually a temporary check post that was still in the process of being established. The check post was set up with the intention of monitoring the movement of miscreants and preventing the inflow of war-like stores into Pallel. It's worth noting that the check post was positioned along the road and did not obstruct civilian movement. Contrary to the allegations made in the article, they were not located on farmland.The Assam Rifles has consistently demonstrated a firm commitment to preserve peace and harmony in Kakching- Pallel area. The diligent efforts of Assam Rifles have played a pivotal role in preventing any unfortunate incidents of communal violence since 03 May 2023.It is essential to acknowledge that multiple communities coexist at Pallel. The deployment of the Assam Rifles serves the interests of all these communities by ensuring security. The deployment of Assam Rifles is not carried out in isolation; it is a result of careful coordination with the State Forces and a thorough understanding of dynamic threat perception.The Assam Rifles proactively engages in communication and is dedicated to collaborate with all security forces and communities, recognising that this approach is essential for achieving enduring peace. The Assam Rifles urges all communities to continue this communication for the betterment of the region. Assam Rifles continues to remain committed to maintain peace in area through its non-partisan, fair & transparent approach.Yours faithfully,Aabha KS,Lieutenent ColonelStaff Officer(Public Relations & Media)"
From-Thangjing-to-Thangting-to-now-claiming-that-the-sacred-site-of-the-Meiteis-fall-under-his-jurisdiction-t,"From Thangjing to Thangting to now claiming that the sacred site of the Meiteis fall under his jurisdiction, the self proclaimed chief of Ukha-Loikhai village has given a new understanding to bogus claims and distorting the history of the land. Not something new for remember ‘ancestral land’ claim has also been raised over Mt Koubru and the bid to change the names of different settlements at Moreh should sum up the machinations at work here. It is good to see the Government has come out with an official notification asserting that not only Thangjing but also the very Ukha-Loikhai settlement comes within the boundary of Churachandpur-Khoupum Protected Forest. The question is when and how the so called Ukha-Laokhai settlement or village emerged and what steps have been taken up or are likely to be taken to evict the said settlement since it has come up inside a Protected Forest. Thangjing Hill Range was notified as a Protected Forest on September 19, 1966 under Section 29 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, according to the Government and here is a case of some elements wilfully entering a Protected Forest, setting up homes and later claiming ownership over a whole hill range. This is something not acceptable and it is clear to all those who have been closely following the ongoing ethnic clash as well as studying the genesis of the clash that the eviction drive launched at K Sonjang village in February 2023, was one of the factors that goaded the people of Churachandpur to target the Meitei settlements at Torbung and Churachandpur on May 3, 2023. The destruction of the open gym set to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister, the setting on fire a beat office of the Forest Department at Churachandpur, the high tension running through Churachandpur, all preceded the Tribal Solidarity March of May 3 last year and it is for this very reason, why The Sangai Express had earlier questioned why the Tribal Solidarity March was not banned in the first place. Manipur and the world is witness to how attempts have been made to defile the understanding of a sacred site of the Meiteis at Thangjing and how a cross was found erected atop the hill range, all with the objective of laying ancestral claim on a land, a site which has been a holy site of one of the two indigenous groups of Manipur, the Meiteis. The politics at play is not only mischievous but also devilishly devious.From Thangjing to Thangting and the devilish design at work does not stop here. After Moreh was ethnically cleansed of all Meiteis and others including the Tamils during the present clash, after the Nagas back in the 1990s, the names of a number of localities have been changed to give it a distinct Kuki-Zo tinge. From Heinou Makhong and Moreh Turel Wangma Leikai to Chikim village is an example that may be cited of the bigger agenda to Kukiise the border town and it is not only the localities that have been renamed here but also Moreh Khunou Leikai to T Yangnom village, Moreh Khongnangthaba Leikai to D Monophai village and Moreh Premnagar to Phaicham village. It is not only at the border town that names of localities have been changed to fall in line with the bigger agenda of Kukiising the place, but also right here in the heart of Imphal where attempts were made to christen a settlement as Vaiphei colony and the ruckus it kicked up sometime in the not so distant past. All these examples coupled with what has been going on at Thangjing hill should be more than clear that all possible attempts are being made to distort the history and legacy of the land and this is where the Government would need to put in more energy in its attempt to blunt and neutralise all such sinister designs. The method at work should not be missed. From christening a place in a term that suits their identity, to later claiming indigeneity to the land and obliterating the history of the indigenous folks is the bigger agenda and this is all the more reason for Manipur to be on its toes and nullify all such attempts. This should also explain the rationale behind the decision to welcome the steps to do away with the Free Movement Regime as well as fence the Indo-Myanmar border."
JERUSALEM-Nov-10-Palestinians-said-Friday-a-deadly-strike-hit-Gaza-s-largest-hospital-compound-as-heavy-fig,"JERUSALEM, Nov 10 : Palestinians said Friday a deadly strike hit Gaza's largest hospital compound as heavy fighting between Hamas and Israel has sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing their homes.Gaza's Hamas government, which reported a toll of 13, and the director of the Al-Shifa hospital, blamed Israeli troops for the strike at the facility sheltering people trying to flee the fighting. Israel did not immediately comment.Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya reported two people were killed and 10 wounded in a strike that he said hit the compound's maternity ward.A Hamas government statement said: ""Thirteen martyrs and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike on Al-Shifa compound today"" in central Gaza City, giving a toll AFP was not immediately able to independently verify.On Thursday Israel had reported heavy fighting near the hospital, saying it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas's capacity to fight.The Israeli army has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, particularly Al-Shifa, to coordinate their attacks against the army and also as hideouts for its commanders. Hamas authorities deny the accusations.Israel launched an offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters poured across the militarised border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages.Vowing to destroy the militants, Israel retaliated with bombardment and a ground campaign that the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says has killed more than 10,800 people, mostly civilians and many of them children.Abu Mohammad, 32, had taken refuge in the hospital along with 15 relatives after the bombardments of his neighbourhood in the northeast part of Gaza City.'No safe place'""There is no safe place left. The army hit Al-Shifa. I don't know what to do,"" he said.  ""There is shooting...  at the hospital. We are afraid to go out.""Witnesses said tanks had surrounded some other hospitals in Gaza City as fierce fighting continued, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee to the south of the territory over the past few weeks.AFPTV footage showed a fireball and smoke rising over the city at dawn. Early Friday sounds of apparent gunfire and explosions could be heard.The heavy fighting in the densely populated coastal territory, which is effectively sealed off, has prompted repeated calls for a ceasefire to protect civilian lives.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected halting the fighting, telling Fox News Thursday that a ""ceasefire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror.""He also looked ahead to the war's end, saying Israel does not ""seek to govern Gaza.""""We don't seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future,"" he told Fox.Tens of thousands of civilians have streamed out of devastated northern Gaza in recent days, with men, women and children clutching meagre possessions as they emerge from the devastated warzone in a river of humanity.They have fled close-quarter fighting, with Hamas militants using rocket-propelled grenades against Israeli troops backed by armoured vehicles and heavy airstrikes.The UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 70,000 people had travelled south on the route since November 4, most of them walking.Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since October 7, it added, more than half the area's population.But the UN estimates hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in the fiercest battle zones in the north.HostagesCharities in Gaza's south, where Palestinians have fled from the heavy fighting to the north, are trying to help by preparing meals for as many people as possible.""As you can see large number of people come here and we can't feed all of them, children, elderly, women. They come here to have food,"" said Ibrahim Shallouf, a Palestinian volunteer.Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals including Al-Shifa to hide its military operations. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged bombardments.AFP"
I-hope-this-letter-finds-you-in-good-health-and-high-spirits-I-am-writing-to-you-today-with-a-deep-sense-of-c,"I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today with a deep sense of concern and urgency regarding a pressing issue that has been affecting the residents of Manipur for the past six months. This issue pertains to the unavailability of reliable internet access in the State, which has had far-reaching consequences, particularly for students and educators.The lack of internet facilities in Manipur has created a myriad of challenges, not only for educational institutions but for the entire population. I would like to highlight several key problems faced by students, teachers, and the general public due to this unfortunate absence of internet access:Educational Disruption: With the majority of educational activities shifting to online platforms, students in Manipur have been severely impacted by the unavailability of internet services. Remote learning, access to study materials, and online classes have become nearly impossible, leading to an interruption in the education of thousands of students.Limited Access to Information: The internet is a vital source of information and knowledge. Without access to the web, individuals in Manipur are unable to stay updated with current events, research information, or access government initiatives and resources, which hampers their socio-economic development.Economic Implications: The absence of internet facilities also affects businesses, hindering their ability to operate efficiently, access e-commerce platforms, and engage in digital marketing. This, in turn, has a detrimental effect on the state's economy.Telemedicine and Healthcare: Internet access is crucial for telemedicine services, which have become increasingly important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in remote areas of Manipur are unable to access online consultations and healthcare resources, which is a matter of great concern.Communication and Connectivity : The lack of internet access has also hindered communication among individuals and communities, creating a sense of isolation and reducing opportunities for social and professional networking.I kindly request your intervention in addressing this pressing issue by ensuring that the residents of Manipur have access to reliable and affordable internet services. This would not only help bridge the digital divide but also contribute to the overall development of the state and the nation.I understand that various challenges may be associated with extending internet connectivity to remote areas, but I firmly believe that the Government's commitment to Digital India can be realized by addressing these issues. I urge you to consider this matter as a priority, and I would greatly appreciate your support in finding a swift and effective solution.Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your positive response and actions that will benefit the people of Manipur.Yours faithfully,Anand Kumar PrasadM.A., M.Ed Junior Teacher Assam Rifles Public schoolMaram, Senapati DistManipur -795015"
Shillong-Dec-21The-Khasi-Hills-Autonomous-District-Council-KHADC-on-Wednesday-passed-an-official-resoluti,"Shillong, Dec 21The Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) on Wednesday passed an official resolution urging the Centre to amend the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 for recognizing only the indigenous tribes as Scheduled Tribes (ST) in Meghalaya.Tabling the resolution, KHADC chief Pyniaid Sing Syiem said, “Whereas, Part XI of the Constitution (Schedule Tribes) Order, 1950, as amended has provided a list of the Scheduled Tribes pertaining to Meghalaya which are deemed to be resident in the localities in relation to the State to which this part relates; And whereas, considering the increase of the demographic status of the indigenous tribes of Meghalaya during the last few years it has become expedient to revisit and re-examine the list provided in Part XI of the Constitution Order, 1950 in so far as Meghalaya is concerned.“Now therefore, this House does hereby resolve to urge upon the Government of India through the State government to take urgent steps to bring an amendment to the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 by recognizing only the Indigenous Tribe as the Schedule Tribes in Meghalaya,” he said.Pyniaid also sought the support of the House and assured to immediately write to the State Government to take up the matter with the Centre to ensure only indigenous tribes of the State are included in the ST list.Supporting the resolution, the Leader of Opposition Titosstarwell Chyne said that in fact he had also submitted a private member’s resolution on the same issue (on December 4). “I thanked the EC for realising the importance of this resolution and tabling it today (for discussion and necessary consideration of the House),” he added.Chyne said the resolution is very important as it is a wake up call for everybody to protect the land and the people.According to him, the objective of the resolution proposed by him was to point out the fact that there are many tribes (as per the ST list), who are getting the same privileges enjoyed by the indigenous people of the state. “My concern is that these tribes can also buy landbut whereas we cannot buy land in their respective States,” he said while alleging that Mizo people are allowed to buy land in Madanrting.“We have talked so much about the issue of influx but we forgot to speak about this issue relating to the exploitation by people belonging to other tribes. Look at what happened in Manipur between the Meiteis and Kukis. Do we also want the same situation in Meghalaya?” Chyne asked.Independent MDC from Nongthymmai Latiplang Kharkongor informed that a conglomeration of traditional heads (under the banner of the Synjuk Ki Nongsynshar Shnong Ka Nongthymmai Pyllun) had already submitted a memorandum (in 2019) to the State Government on the need to immediately amend the Constitution (Scheduled Tribe) Order 1950.Quoting the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in recent years, he said the apex Court had clearly stated that a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in one State cannot be deemed to be SC/ST in another State where he migrated for the purpose of employment or education.“Therefore, it now depends on the State Government to come up with a notification in this regard,” Kharkongor said while citing that States like Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland have already issued notifications to ensure only the tribes indigenous to the State are entitled to the benefits in their respective States.Deputy CEM Pynshngain N Syiem said that the biggest mistake committed when Meghalaya got its statehood was the adoption of Assam rules and acts adding “We should urge the State Government to pursue with the Centre to amend the presidential order of 1950.”He also asserted the need to revisit the Land Transfer Act to ensure not all 66 tribes in the ST list can buy land in Meghalaya.In his reply, CEM assured that his executive committee will take up the matter seriously and said, “I urge the members of the House to support the official resolution.”He however said he cannot divulge much on the details as to how the council will move forward to address the issue.Pyniaid said that in fact during the five months journey of his EC, they have visited the border areas including Block – II area and discussed the need to prevent land encroachment by anyone. He also asked how many times the LO had visited the border areas during his three and a half years as CEM of the council.Meanwhile, the deputy chairman Charles Marngar announced that the official resolution has been passed by the House after the majority had raised their hand in its support.  Hubnews"

Sir-The-Bengaluru-peripheral-ring-road-project-which-has-been-under-scrutiny-for-over-16-years-fo,"Sir,The Bengaluru peripheral ring road project, which has been under scrutiny for over 16 years for the environmental damage it may cause, is back in the news. The Bangalore Development Authority has issued new tenders for the road's construction, despite the lack of an environmental clearance. Over 34,000 trees are at risk of being cut down.  The project is expected to have an impact on Jarakabande Kaval forest land, eight water bodies and another 28 acres of forest land. Furthermore, the project plan has undergone numerous changes, and the extent of the damage it will cause is unknown because a DPR and a new environmental impact assessment have not been published or conducted, respectively.Using an incorrect environmental impact assessment, the Bengaluru Development Authority claimed that only 300 jobs would be lost. The NGT rejected the report based on the Horticulture and Forest Department's submission that approximately 15,000 trees needed to be felled.  As a result, Bengaluru's biodiversity and ecology are threatened!The mismanagement of the peripheral ring road project endangers birds, animals, trees, water bodies, and farmers’ livelihoods. As a result, the parties involved should publish the detailed project report for everyone to comment on, as well as conduct a new environmental impact assessment as soon as possible.Yours faithfully,Vijaykumar HK, Environmentalist Raichur, Karnataka"

Shobha-Shukla-Kalpana-Acharya-Contd-from-previous-issueIt-became-all-the-more-difficult-for-me-to-go-thro,"Shobha Shukla, Kalpana AcharyaContd from previous issueIt became all the more difficult for me to go through these side effects of TB treatment as at that time I was living all by myself in a hostel - far away from my family and parents. My studies suffered as I could not go to the college for over a month. My mental health also got negatively affected as I was mortified of people finding out of me having TB.My parents too asked me not to share about my disease with anyone, but rather say that it was ‘chest infection’ to skirt TB stigma. TB stigma was so severe that I started having self-doubts. I had not even shared about my TB treatment with my friends. It be- came more traumatizing as I had no one to share with of what I was going through.”After a month of fighting it all alone, Binika left the hostel and moved with in her parents.Family support made it more bearable. “As time passed by, my parents suggested that I drop out of college because I was so unwell. It was a struggle to walk properly even for a minute. Climbing a staircase became a herculean task. But I persisted. I had worked very hard in my life to get into college, so I was very reluctant to drop out of it. I kept on coping somehow, not only with the physical side effects of TB treatment, but also with TB stigma, which lurked around me menacingly for quite a long time.”She became TB negative but positively resolute to end TBBinika could eventually see the light at the end of the tunnel when her six-months long TB treatment got over and she was declared TB negative.“After I completed my Bachelor of Public Health degree, see the turn of fate-my first job was of becoming a District Programme Officer for TB - the same disease which had almost made me dropout of college and thwart my efforts to live my dream! This is my life story for now–my journey from pain to strength.”Find all TB early and accurately and link to continuum of careAs per the latest Global TB Report of the World Health Organization (WHO), only about half of the estimated TB patients in Nepal are notified every year: out of 70,000 cases every year, 37,000 are notified. Of those notified every year, only half of them get diagnosed using a WHO recommended molecular test.When a person with presumptive TB is offered a TB test, it should be a WHO recommended molecular test upfront. WHO has called upon all the Governments to 100% replace microscopy (which badly underperforms in diagnosing TB) with molecular test by 2027. At the 2023 UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on TB, the world leaders had reechoed their promise to do so by 2027.But progress is appallingly slow with only 47% of TB patients worldwide getting diagnosed using a molecular test (and the rest are still diagnosed using microscopy).Binika agrees: Early and accurate TB diagnosis is not only a critical gateway to TB care pathway, but also a public health and human rights imperative. It helps stop the spread of TB infection as well as reduces unnecessary human suffering and risk of untimely deaths due to TB.Bringing “lab to the people” (and not people to the lab) is the first vital step towards finding all TB. If we fail to do this, we will keep missing TB cases despite having the best of tools in the labs.If problem is at the grassroots, then why are programmes not rooted there?“Community engagement and awareness is a critical cog-in-the-wheel to find all TB, treat all TB and prevent all TB. If the problem is in the grassroots, then the programmes should also be at the grassroots. If the problem is in the community, then the programmes should also be in the communities. We have to detect TB early and accurately,” asserts Binika.Bringing the laboratory services closer to the community, especially in coun- tries with centralized health-care services like Nepal can be a big game changer in the context of finding TB early and linking with care, said Binika.The WHO recommended point-of-care and decentralized molecular test (True- nat) can increase accessibility of TB testing for people who would otherwise either get missed or diagnosed late. Molecular tests not only accurately tell if a person has TB but also confirm if a person is resistant to most powerful anti- TB drugs, like rifampicin.(To be contd)"
Dipak-KurmiContd-from-previous-issueThis-envisioned-a-seamless-integration-of-the-military-with-the-Minist,"Dipak KurmiContd from previous issueThis envisioned a seamless integration of the military with the Ministry, fostering a collaborative environment where uniformed soldiers would collaborate with bureaucrats, breaking down traditional hierarchies. Notably, a similar proposal had been put forth by a Group of Ministers (GoM) in 2001. However, faced with staunch opposition from bureaucrats, the BJP had to compromise, resulting in the creation of the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS). While the three services collaborated within the IDS, the civilian bureaucracy remained somewhat detached. This compromise persisted throughout the UPA's decade-long tenure in power.In the concluding segment of its 2014 manifesto, the BJP outlined various minor commitments. Among these, addressing a critical 25% shortfall in officers by recruiting higher-caliber individuals was pledged, although this goal has not been entirely realized to date. Notably, the promise to construct a National war memorial was successfully achieved, marking a tangible accomplishment. Reflecting the rising political influence of ex-servicemen, the BJP committed to establishing a ""veterans' commission"" dedicated to addressing the concerns of retired soldiers, sailors, airmen, and their families. Additionally, the party vowed to implement the ""one rank, one pension"" policy, a goal that has largely been fulfilled. In a bid to bolster indigenous defense production, the BJP expressed its commitment to encouraging private sector participation and investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI) in selected defense industries.Both the BJP and its predecessor, the Congress, refrained from including commitments on defense spending in their manifestos. This is noteworthy, especially considering the decline in allocations from 4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the late 1980s to less than 2 percent at present. In contrast, all 31 member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are obligated to allocate 2 percent of their GDPs to defense, benefiting from the assurance of collective defense as military allies. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty underscores the commitment that an act of violence against one member is deemed an armed attack against all members, prompting necessary actions to aid the attacked ally. In the Indian context, where the Nation chooses an independent stance against an enemy attack, some advocate for defense allocations to be fixed at 3 percent of GDP. However, amidst the continuous decline in real defense allocations, achieving a 3 percent defense spending pledge appears increasingly improbable.The frugality in resource allocation extends to growth targets within the aerospace and defense industry, a domain where political parties opt for the articulation of objectives through policy documents rather than in their political manifestos. The trajectory of indigenous defense production growth in the past two decades aligns with the objectives outlined in the 2018 Ministry of Defence roadmap known as the Defence Production Policy of 2018 (DPrP 2018). According to this policy, the annual target for aerospace and defense services and production turnover by 2025 was set at Rs 1.7 trillion (then $26 billion). Achieving this target necessitated an additional investment of nearly Rs 70,000 crore (then $10 billion), fostering employment opportunities for approximately 2 to 3 million individuals. Furthermore, the 2018 policy aimed at fostering exports of defense goods and services amounting to Rs 35,000 crore (then $5 billion) by the year 2025.In a departure from the conventional approach of revising production targets through upcoming manifestos, the recent upward adjustment in the production target, specifically in industrial production, took a different avenue. Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, rather than awaiting the 2024 manifesto, made the announcement. According to his statement, aerospace and defense services and production are projected to reach Rs 3,00,000 crore (US $36 billion) by the fiscal year 2028-29. Simultaneously, he outlined plans to elevate export production to Rs 50,000 crore ($6.25 billion) within the same time frame. This shift in strategy underscores a dynamic and responsive approach to goal-setting within the aerospace and defense sector.To accommodate the heightened production levels of goods and services, it becomes imperative for the 2024 manifesto to incorporate a well-defined policy aimed at bolstering exports. India, once predominantly an arms importer, has now secured a position among the top 25 arms-exporting nations. A mere seven to eight years ago, defense exports languished below the Rs 1,000 crore mark. Presently, there has been a remarkable surge, with defense exports soaring to an impressive Rs 16,000 crore. This transformative shift underscores the need for a strategic and comprehensive approach to further elevate India's standing in the global arms export landscape.The BJP's forthcoming 2024 manifesto should elucidate the practicalities behind ambitious statements such as preparing for a ""two-front war."" This scenario entails the military triumph over Pakistan, deterring China, addressing insurgency challenges in Jammu & Kashmir, all while maintaining control over the Indian Ocean. At first glance, the prospect of a two-front war suggests a comprehensive breakdown in Indian strategy, diplomacy, border and military management, as well as internal security. Preparing for such a worst-case scenario could distort our defense planning, financial allocations, and troop deployment. Strategic prudence dictates that the Nation's top security strategists collaboratively work to ensure that India never finds itself in a situation where it confronts full-scale warfare on multiple fronts.(The writer can be reached at[email protected])"

Vidula-Abhyankar-under-the-guidance-of-Dr-Sumaila-Parveen-Prof-Dept-of-Psychology-LPU-INTRODUCTIONEvery,"Vidula Abhyankar (under the guidance of Dr Sumaila Parveen, Prof Dept of Psychology, LPU)INTRODUCTIONEveryone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being. Stress can be defined as a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Typically, the bad stress, also known as Distress has the potential to do more damage to a person’s mental and physical well-being. According to a qualitative study on perceptions of stress, stressors and coping mechanisms among urban adolescents in India conducted by Dr GV Krishnaveni and others in 2021 for National Institute of Health India, adolescents in India are exposed to a wide range of stressors in their daily lives.Anxiety disorders are characterized by unrealistic or irrational fears that cause significant distress or impairments in functioning. (Butcher, Hooley, Mineka, 2019) According to Bernstein, in a study of 988 adolescents, female gender, somatic complaints, history of physical and sexual abuse, poor grades, use of street drugs, and family history related to depression were among factors that differentiated adolescents reporting high anxiety from those reporting low anxiety. (Bernstein, et al.,1989)Depression is the common cold of mental disorders; most people will be affected by depression in their lives either directly or indirectly, through a friend or a family member. The incidence of depression rises sharply during adolescence-a period of great turmoil for many people. Approximately 15-20% adolescents experience major depressive disorder at some point. (Avenevoli et al. 2008, Lewinsohn & Essau 2002)According to the World Health Organisation, Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work. Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men.Adolescence represents an important time for building identity, setting clearer goals, and planning for the future (Johnson et al., 2014). Rapid changes and growth in adolescence make them sensitive to heightened stress within the family, interpersonal relationships, socio-economic status, and education (Steinberg, 2014). Adolescents go through physical, biological, social, and intellectual transformation, and adjustments must be dealt with concurrently. Experiencing Stressful Life Events and being at risk of violence at this stage in their lives can disrupt this transition, affect adaptive capabilities, and make their adjustment burdensome, leading to adverse health outcomes (McMahon et al., 2020).Experiences of traumatic stress are prominent in adolescence and can have deleterious effects on healthy development and psychosocial wellbeing (Ponnamperuma& Nicolson, 2018). In adolescence, social relations are vital and can thus have a protective role against the harmful effects of such events (Washington et al., 2017). Studies have shown that there may not be a direct association between experience of hardship, stress, and mental health, but the link is modified by different factors (Huang et al., 2021; LeMoult et al., 2019).Demography of ManipurHistorically, the Meitei dynasty ruled the independent kingdom of Manipur. The region has been prone to ethnic violence for decades, ever since the king of Manipur, Bodh Chandra, signed an accord with the Government of India to become a part of the newly independent Nation of India in 1949. After Manipur formally joined India, it became a Union Territory in 1956 and finally a full State, with Governors, in 1972. The traditional conflict was between the Naga and Kuki tribes, but the recent violence has been between the Meiteis and Kukis.The ‘cultural distance’ widened with almost all the tribes coming under the Christian fold by the 1930s (Ministry of Development of North East Region ARC- 7th Report, Chapter 12). Further the conflict widened between Meiteis and Kukis caused by the influx of immigrants from Myanmar following the assimilation of Manipur into India. The State’s population rapidly increased with the arrival of new residents from Myanmar, with the demographic shifts leading to structural changes in land holdings and jobs.Ethnic clashes in the past: There is considerable tension among the tribes over land and boundaries and violence between Nagas and Kukis took a toll of more than 2000 lives during the 1990s. In the southern parts of the State Hmars, Paites and other tribes have been waging violent struggles partly for local hegemony and partly for their own enclave in the form of a Union Territory called ‘Zomiland.’Recent Meitei-Kuki ethnic clash from 03 May 2023 till date as a stressor for Adolescents : All the tribes in hills have got Scheduled Tribe Status, while Meiteis are in General Category, hence the Meitei groups also have been demanding ST status for last 15 years. According to the affidavit submitted by Union Home Secretary in the Supreme Court, “large-scale violence broke out in the State of Manipur on 03.05.2023 after a Tribal Solidarity March undertaken by All Tribal Students Union Manipur (ATSUM) in opposition to the demand for inclusion of the Meitei community in the list of Scheduled Tribes. Thereafter large-scale violence broke out in the State of Manipur, and due to the violence, many residents of Manipur lost their lives and several others got seriously injured, their houses and properties were burnt down due to arson and many of them were rendered homeless. Moreover, incidents of violence and heinous crimes against women have come to light.”The intensity of violence rose ten folds in the months that followed as both communities started their own systems of armed village defence volunteers who started guarding each village boundaries. Since all schools and colleges were closed with immediate effect, adolescents were engaged in acting as village defence volunteers to keep vigil at respective village borders. Many adolescents had to flee with their families in search of safer places to stay.Due to the mass exodus that followed many of these innocent people found themselves being thrown out of their houses, their valuables looted, their houses/shops burnt down and destroyed using heavy equipment such as Bulldozers, Cranes and Earth Movers overnight without any provocation. The displaced families were gradually moved to various Government schools/Sports stadiums which were converted into transit Relief Camps.NEED FOR THE STUDYPrevious studies on mental health of adolescents in India concentrate on onset of stress, anxiety and depression due to academic stress (Jayanthi, et. al., 2015) or stress caused due to natural calamities such as earthquakes (R Mondal, S Sarkar, et. al.,2013), cyclones and so on. There is not much literature published on the effects of armed conflicts, ethnic clashes, or riots on adolescents in terms of onset of Stress, Anxiety and Depression. Further, there is not much published literature on Anxiety, Depression and Stress among adolescents of Manipur as the ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities are unprecedented and still ongoing in the State. There is a need to study the impact of traumatic experiences that these adolescents have undergone during the ongoing ethnic clashes and understand whether there is a prevalence of symptoms related to Anxiety, Depression and Stress in them. Also, there is a need to understand other factors associated with the traumatic experiences such as gender and its influence, if any, on the mental status of the adolescents. It will be worthwhile to understand if there is any correlation between Stress, Anxiety and Depression experienced by the adolescents displaced or living in affected areas of Manipur.(To be contd)"

The-Manipur-People-s-Against-Citizenship-Amendment-Bill-MANPAC-has-strongly-condemned-the-act-of-some-,"IMPHAL, Oct 5The Manipur People's Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (MANPAC) has strongly condemned the act of some school authori-ties who prevented students from organising/taking part in human chain protest on October 3, terming it as a violation of the democratic rights of the people.MANPAC also condemned the failure of All India Radio, Imphal to mention a single word about the huge mass protest staged all over the State on the said day in their evening news broadcast, but appreciated other media houses and fraternity for properly covering the news.A statement issued by the core committee of MANPAC today conveyed that following the intense demand for the implementation of an ILP system in the State to save the indigenous people from the threat posed by the unchecked influx of outsiders, the Manipur People Bill 2018 was passed by the Manipur State Assembly.However, the Bill is yet to get any form of assent from the President of the country, it mentioned adding that at such a critical juncture, no people of the region, in their right mind, would agree to the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB).Stressing on the recent scrapping of Article 370 and Article 35 A from Jammu and Kashmir by the Centre which is regarded by many as a direct threat to democracy, MANPAC cautioned politicians, MLAs and Ministers of the State that if CAB is passed forcefully, its adverse impacts will fall upon all, including them.Demanding all the authorities concerned to immediately stop giving false assurance and promises to the people, it warned the Central Government that if it fails to respect the sentiments of the people of Manipur, the end result will not be a good one.It is high time for all to come together and adopt a resolution against this threat, it added.Brushing aside the so called promises by the leaders of the Central Govern- ment to include a clause for protection of the people of the North East and Manipur, MANPAC appealed to the people of all communities to realise who the real enemy is andto stay alert against any attempt to create mistrust and hatred among the people.It also appealed to the State Government to let go of its attitude of seeing the CSOs and the people in the wrong light whenever they rise in protest as well as to stop the practice of using force to subdue the people.On the other hand, MANPAC expressed gratitude to the women vendors of Khwairamband Keithel, leaders, students of various schools, colleges and institutions, CSOs as well as the general public who took part in the protest on October 3 and added that MANPAC will continue its protest against the CAB."

We must know that the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy requires systemic changes that will result not only in new products and services but also in changes in production processes and business models.It means we have to focus more on greening the training or promoting green skills amongst young people. This greening of the economy will inevitably change the skills required and the tasks involved in many of the existing occupations.We must know that green skills are those that enable the environmental sustainability of economic activities. Skill Council for Green Jobs is one of the most recently launched initiatives of the Government of India aligned to the National Skill Development Mission. It is promoted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). We are aware that most skill training programmes or vocational training programmes focus on mecha- nical/technical skills rather than ‘green’ skills. Green skills are important as it contributes towards sustaina- bility or sustainable development.In line with the Skill India Mission of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) utilizing the vast network and expertise of ENVIS Hubs/RPs, has taken up an initiative for skill development in the environment and forest sector to enable India's youth to get gainful employment and/or self-employment, called the Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP).Few courses related to green skill training includes:Value addition and Marketing of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) : Lantana Furniture and Crafts; Value addition and Marketing of NTFPs (Plant Origin): Coconut Shells & Fibre Handicrafts; Value addition and Marketing of NTFPs (Plant Origin): Bamboo Crafts; Value addition and Marketing of NTFPs (Plant Origin): NTFP Products / Medicinal Plants; Bird Identification and basic ornithology; Value addition and Marketing of NTFPs (Animal Origin) : Wild Bee Keeping & Processing; Sustain and Enhance Technical Knowledge in Solar Energy Systems; Propagation and Management of Bamboo; Plantation Techniques and Utilization of Renewable Energy in Arid Zone; Forest Entomology & Pest Control; Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Green GDP; Water Budgeting & Auditing; Bird Migration and Migration study techniques; Pollution Monitors : Air and Water Pollution; Laboratory Technicians/ Technical Assistants for energy efficiency, star labelling and other electrical testing for environmental criteria; Advance Course in Para taxonomy including Peoples Biodiversity Register (PBR); Wildlife Management using Geospatial Techniques; Plant Tissue Culture Techniques and its Applications; Waste Management : (Solid Waste, Biomedical Waste, Plastic Waste, E-Waste, Construction and Demolition Waste); Laboratory Assistant for Eco Friendly Food testing Laboratory, etc .The candidates completing the Course(s) may be employed gainfully in the zoos/wildlife sanctuaries/national parks/biosphere reserves/ Botanical Gardens/Nurseries/wetland sites/State Bio-diversity Boards/Biodiversity Management Committees/Wildlife Crime Control Bureau; industries (involved in production/ manufacturing of green products, as ETP operator); tourism (as Nature/Eco-tourist Guides), agriculture (as organic farmers/ green practitioners), education & research sectors as well as engage in waste management (in Municipal Corporations/ Councils/Urban Local bodies to advise on how to improve sewage, sanitation, land use services/ tackle pollution), water management, construction related areas, etc. Some of the courses enable the candidates to become self- employed.There is no doubt that green jobs are decent jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the environment, be they in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and construction, or in new, emerging green sectors such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.This year’s International Youth Day which is observed around the world on 12th August is focusing on green skills for a sustainable world. Green skilling means our commitment towards the planet and lets contribute towards the earth by enhancing green skills.(Ranjan K Baruah is a career mentor and skill trainer and currently Adviser of Skill Employment and Entrepreneurship Department of BTR, Kokrajhar and can be reached at 8473943734 or[email protected])"

Newmai-News-NetworkDIMAPUR-Mar-21-NSCN-IM-chairman-Q-Tuccu-has-called-upon-the-Nagas-to-reflect-on-the-s,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Mar 21: NSCN (IM) chairman Q Tuccu has called upon the Nagas to reflect on the significance of the Naga Constitution and the values it upholds.This was mentioned in the speech of the NSCN (IM) chairman on the 45th Naga Republic Day celebration at Council Headquarters, Hebron near Dimapur today.Addressing the day, Tuccu said that the day is a great day in the history of the Nagas. “As we celebrate this historic day, let us take a moment to reflect on the significance of our Constitution and the values it upholds. Our Constitution is a beacon of hope, a symbol of our commitment to stand by our historical and political rights. Let us therefore, breathe the air of faith in our hearts and the memories of those who have shown us the way through their martyrdom. Let us salute the Naga Nation today and fill our hearts with pride and hope in our Almighty God who has sustained us giving us the courage to stand by our rights,” the leader added.Q Tuccu urged the Nagas to remember their patriotic leaders and give their gratitude to many people who fought for “our God given rights under the banner of our Flag”. He said the Naga Flag tells everything about the Naga Nation, the Naga identity that nobody can take away. “It is this Flag that brings us all together as a Nation. Let me remind you that from the day NSCN entered into political talks with the Government of India we made our stand very clear that no attempt should be made to bully the Nagas into submission,” he informed.“We took the bold stand to tell the Government of India that the blunder of history should not be repeated by introducing another 16 point type of solution,” said the NSCN leader.  Having taken such a stand, it is no doubt a tough negotiation all the way as the Government of India is desperate to have its way imposed on the Nagas, the NSCN (IM) leader said.“We stood the ground, not submitting to their self-centred and domineering narrative. Our perseverance was ultimately rewarded when the final breakthrough came in 2002 when the unique history of the Nagas and the situation was given official recognition by the Government of India. This changes the power dynamics of NSCN and boosts their morale. It was a turning point and milestone as the absolute truth of the historical and political rights of the Nagas was placed beyond the contestable spectrum”, he said.However, Tuccu said it took them more than a decade of tough talking to take forward the Indo-Naga political talks based on the unique history of the Nagas. “No wonder the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi demonstrated a high level of initiative to solve the Naga political issue to end the seven decades old Naga issue once and for all,” Tuccu said. Finally, the world was awakened when the high profile signing ceremony of Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015, was broadcast live on TV channels to make the world bear witness to the historic agreement, he recalled. “Significantly, this agreement made an indelible impact on the Indo-Naga political talks as we remained resolute to stand by Framework Agreement in the face of the flagging attention by the Government of India,” the NSCN (IM) chairman added.Q Tuccu further, “We are now in a situation where we must exhibit true political courage”. He also said NSCN is not ready to stand by and tamely accept defeat to surrender the rights of the Nagas. “Let us together carry on the essence of Naga republic beyond this moment. Let us exercise our duty to uphold the values as we continue with this timeless tradition as it symbolizes the achievement of Naga independence and the establishment of our Government to assert our political identity”.The NSCN-IM leader said the Naga Republic Day also highlights the democratic values and principles of the Naga Constitution which serves as the guiding document for the Nation. “May the flame of patriotism continue to burn brightly in the hearts of all Nagas,” he concluded."

Shahnaz-HusainIf-you-are-frustrated-over-high-cost-of-beauty-parlous-and-dermatologist-in-treating-skin,"Shahnaz HusainIf you are frustrated over high cost of  beauty parlous and  dermatologist in treating skin and hair beauty  problems than all you need to do is to squeeze out some fresh lemon juice from your own kitchen and drink lemon water daily and also apply it on your skin also. The sunny yellow fruit will provide smooth, flawless and radiant skin by removing dead cells and act as a natural lightener for hair and skin by regulating acidity and eliminating fat. Lemon is rich in Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Carbohydrates, Magnesium and Phosphorus that rejuvenates skin, absorbs the oiliness, cleans the skin pores and improves texture and condition of skin and hair.Lemon has astringent properties which help in preventing sign of premature aging like wrinkles and fine lines and restore skin elasticity to maintain youthful appearance.Most of us know that Lemon is a rich source of Vitamin C and have taken it at some time or other.  Added to a glass of cold water, it can be most refreshing during hot and humid weather. Taken regularly, it is a preventive against colds and actually strengthens the immune system. We also add it to salads, snacks and food, because its tanginess adds to their flavour. There are a number of ways that the common lemon can be used for beauty too.Lemon is best taken diluted, adding it to water. You can start your day with the juice of a lemon in a glass of warm water. This combination helps to keep the system flushed and aid the removal of toxins and wastes. This will also reflect on the skin, keeping it clear and glowing. Weight watchers will also find this beneficial.As a cosmetic ingredient, lemon can be used in various ways. The only thing to remember is not to use it undiluted, as it can be harsh on the skin. On areas where the skin is thicker, lemon can be used by itself. For example, for dark elbows, rub lemon halves and then wash off with water. Over a period of time, it will cleanse the skin and lighten its colour.Lemon can also be used as a hand lotion. Mix it with rose water and rub it into the skin of the hands. For rough hands, rub granulated sugar and the juice of a lemon together with the hands, till the sugar dissolves. Then rinse off with water. Done regularly, it will help to improve the skin texture.Oily skins can really benefit from a lemon treatment. Dilute the juice of half a lemon in a glass of water and use this to wash your face. If it seems harsh for your skin, add more water. Gently blot the face with tissue or a clean towel, instead of wiping it. Lemon not only helps to restore the normal acid-alkaline balance, but also reduces surface oil. This treatment can be beneficial during summer, when the skin tends to seem more oily. Some people have sensitive skins. So, if your skin burns or itches with the application of lemon-water, you should not use it.Honey mixed with lemon juice can be applied on the face daily. While honey moisturizes the skin, lemon juice restores the normal balance and lightens skin colour over a period of time of regular use. For oily skin use one part of honey with two parts lemon juice. For normal and dry skin, use honey and lemon juice in equal quantities.Lemon can also be used as a hair rinse. You can add lemon juice to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse, after your shampoo. You can even add it to “tea water”.  Boil used tea leaves in enough water and cool the liquid. Add the juice of one lemon and use it as a last rinse. This helps to add shine to the hair.Due to its many beneficial properties, lemon has been used as an ingredient to formulate creams and lotions for skin care. It has been used, along with aloe vera to formulate cleansing gels, helping to get rid of dirt and pollutants, without disturbing the normal acid-alkaline balance. A lemon-turmeric cream has been used as a pre-bath cream and also a soap substitute, for people with dry, dehydrated and sensitive skins. Lemon is a powerful natural cleanser.When nature has provided us with ideal cosmetic ingredients, why should we use chemicals and synthetic substances ? In fact, the human body responds well to natural substances, while it has an in-built resistance to synthetic ones.The author is an internationally famed beauty expert and is called herbal queen of India"
AIZAWL-Dec-23-Smuggling-of-meth-amphetamine-an-addictive-stimulant-has-been-increa-sing-rapidly-in-the-no,"AIZAWL, Dec 23Smuggling of meth-amphetamine, an addictive stimulant, has been increa-sing rapidly in the north- eastern region of India. Drug traffickers are now using the northeast corridor to smuggle methamphetamine from Myanmar to other parts of India.The drug traffickers mostly use Mizoram and Manipur to smuggle methamphetamine from Myan- mar to India via the porous border areas. While Mizo-ram shares a 510-Kms-long border with Myanmar, Manipur shares a 398-kilometre-long border with the Southeast Asian country. These addictive tablets then make their way to other parts of the country through Meghalaya and Assam by road, train, and even air. The law enforcement agencies have arrested several drug traffickers and seized methamphetamine worth several hundred crores of rupees over the past few years.Mizoram Director General of Police (DGP) Anil Shukla told ABP Live, “Smuggling of methamphetamine has increased in Mizoram in the last few months. In the last couple of months, we have seized consignments of the narcotic drug worth over Rs 100 crore. We have also awarded an airline staffer for helping us arrest two individuals and seize a large quantity of methamphetamine from their possession at the Lengpui airport.”The Mizoram police on October 3 this year seized methamphetamine tablets estimated to be over Rs 25.49 crore in the international market from two passengers hailing from Myanmar at the Lengpui airport near the State capital, Aizawl. The passengers were travelling to New Delhi.In Assam too, the law enforcement agencies have arrested many drug traffickers and seized methamphetamine worth hundreds of crores of rupees from different parts of the State.Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Crime Investigation Department (CID), Assam, Munna Prasad Gupta, told ABP Live that seizure of methamphetamine in Assam has increased in the recent past and is more frequently seized now as compared to the previous years. The top police official said that methamphetamine, including tablets and capsules, with a market value of Rs 181.86 crore, have been seized between January 1, 2023 and December 19, 2023, from across the State.Security forces on October 19, 2023, arrested two persons and seized methamphetamine tablets valued at Rs 20 crore in the grey market at Silchar’s Kumbhirgram airport in Assam’s Cachar district. Both the accused were residents of Mizoram.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Guwahati Zone, busted an inter-State network, involved in supplying methamphetamine in Assam’s State capital Guwahati on November 28 this year.The sleuths of NCB apprehended two alleged drug smugglers at the Guwahati railway station while they were on their way from Manipur’s Moreh to West Bengal’s Cooch Behar in a train. The NCB team seized a total of 9.669 kilograms of methamphetamine tablets, estimated to be nearly Rs 50 crore in the grey market, from their possession.Drug de-addiction activists have expressed grave concern over the growing popularity and use of methamphetamine by the people in India, especially the youth of the country. According to activists working in the field of drug de-addiction, methamphetamine is slowly taking the place of heroin. The drug is the new choice of addicts, said experts, as it is comparatively cheaper than heroin but gives a similar ""hit"".Experts ABP Live spoke to said that methamphetamine is an addictive stimulant that is mostly consumed by the youths in Asian countries. The narcotic substance is mostly consumed at raves and techno parties. Methamphetamine, shortly known as meth, is either snorted or injected by the drug addicts by crushing the tablets into powder. Methamphetamine is made by mixing the prescription drug, amphetamine, with highly toxic substances including battery acid, paint thinner, drain cleaners, and lighter fluid in certain amounts.Substance Use Disorder (SUD) professional, Ratul Dey, told ABP Live, “Amphetamine is used as a recreational drug. People consume it to boost libido, increase wakefulness, improve cognitive control, enhance sociability and induce euphoria. It can also speed up reaction times, increase muscle strength and reduce fatigue. When amphetamines are used at higher doses and through routes that are not prescribed by a doctor, they can have crippling effects on the human body.”“Dopamine levels in the brain can rise quickly and to a great extent. Overuse and repeated abuse can lead to psychosis and delusions, feelings of paranoia and hostility, cardiovascular problems including stroke, reduction in cognitive ability, breakdown of muscles, and malnutrition. Withdrawal symptoms include depression and sleep disturbances. People who crush and inject a tablet may have blockages in their small blood vessels, as some of the components do not break down,” Dey added.Experts say that meth is much more dangerous in nature than heroin and has severe adverse effects to the human body.ABP"

TAMENGLONG-Mar-19-The-Rongmei-Naga-Council-Manipur-RNCM-strongly-denounced-the-incident-that-happened-at,"TAMENGLONG, Mar 19 : The Rongmei Naga Council Manipur (RNCM) strongly denounced the incident that happened at FCI, Sangaiprou,  on March 18, 2024, in which the ration allocated for the hill districts was forcefully unloaded allegedly by some gun totting miscreant and reportedly mishandled the staff on duty.The RNCM in a press release said that the quota entitled to every bonafide citizen is a constitutional Right guaranteed under the Food Security Act, and no group individual or authority should have the right to come on the way against the system delivering that justice.'Such irresponsible act directed against some community might possibly lead to a more complicated situation when the system is extremely vulnerable, being susceptible to inter communal conflict at the slightest provocation', it added.The Rongmei body further maintained that the backlog of 2023 and the delay of the distribution for the year 2024, including the honorarium since 2020, has been duly acknowledged on several occasion to the authorities concerned , however, the interest of the public is not resolved till date despite assurance given by the relevant representatives.Taking into consideration the gravity of the matter, the RNCM in consultation with all the federal units concerned namely RNCM, Luangrians, RNSOM, RNYOM, RNLPM and other area based CSOs served an ultimatum of 24 hours, with effect from 12 noon of March 19 that the allocated FCI ration should be station at their designated place, failing which the people shall resort to mass agitation howsoever deemed fit."
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-20-Several-Government-Meetei-employees-have-urged-the-Election-Commissio,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 20 : Several Government Meetei employees have  urged the Election Commission and all relevant authorities to let them do election duty at Meetei villages given the situation in Manipur.It is reported that some Government employees who are Meeteis have been given election duty at Tamenglong and Noney.Speaking to the media at Manipur Press Club today, a staff teacher Nongmaithem Hemchandra said that it will be unsafe for the Meeteis to pass through Kuki villages and discharge election duty at Tamenglong and Noney.He said that they have taken a resolution to not discharge election duty at Tamenglong and Noney.Many places in Manipur are still unsafe to attend office and sending them to areas which otherwise have been seen as  sensitive or pass through high risk areas for election duty would be problematic.Stating that the atmosphere in Manipur is not conducive for the  Meeteis to take the road surface and go to Noney and Tamenglong, Hemchandra asked how they can pass through all the sensitive areas along Imphal-Tamenglong road amid the volatile situation in the State."
The-silence-continues-add-the-line-for-over-9-months-and-what-has-made-the-continuation-of-this-conspiracy-of,"The silence continues-add the line for over 9 months-and what has made the continuation of this ‘conspiracy of silence’ more eloquent this time is the fact that it came just one day after Chief Minister N Biren tweeted on X that the Government of India is ‘set to take some important decisions in the interests of the people of Manipur.’ Qualifying the line ‘set to take some important decisions in the interests of the people of Manipur’ with the continued silence, will probably be the most impactful blow for Manipur even as the world has stepped into the second month of 2024. After what the Chief Minister tweeted on February 3, the focus of Manipur was on the scheduled visit of the Prime Minister to Guwahati on February 4, but the silence since the evening of May 3, 2023 continued and continues to this day making one wonder if the ‘important decisions’ meant continuing with the self imposed silence. True the Chief Minister tweeted the ‘some important decisions’ line after meeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah and not the Prime Minister, but surely the two most important men in the BJP led NDA Government at Delhi would not have struck different stands on the same subject. This is why the focus of Imphal on Guwahati during the Prime Minister’s visit, just next door. So what are the important decisions that may be taken in the interests of Manipur, is the question that is doing the round, and in line with the continued silence of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister N Biren too has preferred not to say anything more than what he tweeted on X on February 3. The silence after the grand announcement on X and the ‘he came but did not look beyond Assam or the coming Lok Sabha election’ line comes uncomfortably close to the understanding of the chicken neck syndrome. Not that anyone expects a magic formula to come from the Prime Minister but as veteran CPI leader of Manipur, Dr Nara so eloquently put it, ‘This is beyond our belief that the Prime Minister did not say anything on the Manipur issue’. An address to the crowd lasting nearly 32 minutes sans any reference to the ongoing mayhem here says so many things and questions are sure to be raised against the BJP led Government at Imphal. Or is the Prime Minister and his men satisfied with the fact that the BJP led Government here will be in power till at least 2027 ? Only time will tell but the silence irks and it could say so many things, leaving it wide open to different interpretations.It will not make up for the continued silence, a silence that comes close to the understanding of a conspiracy, but why hasn’t the Chief Minister elaborated on the important decisions the Centre is set to take on behalf of Manipur ? Or would spelling it out or hinting at it come close to the understanding of counting the chicks before they hatch ? Either way, it stands that Manipur is still a long way to come anywhere near the understanding of normalcy. And it has been like this for over 9 months. It should be more than obvious that the writ of the State Government no longer runs in many hill districts, particularly at Churachandpur and Kangpokpi. At Moreh, in Tengnoupal district, every efforts are being made to show that there is a Government in place, with the men in khakis leading the way, but does this not say something profound ? Does not portend well for Manipur at all. The emergence of power players such as CoTU at Kangpokpi, the ITLF at Churachandpur and numerous other powerful groups should say something profound about Manipur as a whole. Show there is a Government in place, and perhaps the starting point would be to see what sort of action can be taken up against the MLAs who have raised the call for a Separate Administration. Such a step can a long way in demonstrating that there is a Government in place and this is what Manipur needs right now."

Naypyidaw-Feb-11The-Government-in-Myanmar-has-announced-compulsory-military-service-for-all-young-men-and-w,"Naypyidaw, Feb 11The Government in Myanmar has announced compulsory military service for all young men and women as the country's turmoil continues.The army seized power from the civilian Government in a coup in February 2021.But in recent months it has been defeated in a series of battles with ethnic militias and anti-coup fighters.The move announced on Saturday will require all men aged 18-35, and women aged 18-27, to serve at least two years under military command.No further details have been released. But in a statement, the junta said its Defence Ministry would ""release necessary bylaws, procedures, announcements, orders, notifications and instructions"".The military has faced a series of humiliating defeats in recent months.At the end of last year, three ethnic insurgent armies in Shan State-supported by other armed groups that oppose the Government-captured border crossings and roads carrying most of the overland trade with China.Last month, the Arakan Army (AA) said it had taken control of Paletwa in Chin State and the last military post in Paletwa township, the hilltop base at Meewa.The military-installed President of Myanmar, Myint Swe-a former General-has previously warned the country is in danger of breaking apart if the Government could not bring fighting under control.A law allowing conscription was introduced in Myanmar in 2010, but has not been not enforced until now.Under the legislation, the terms of service can be extended up to a period of five years during a state of emergency. Those ignoring summons to serve can instead be jailed for the same period.A state of emergency was announced by the country's junta in 2021 and was recently extended for a further six months.Myanmar had endured almost 50 years of rule under oppressive military regimes before the move towards democracy in 2011.On 1 February 2021, the military announced it had taken control of the country.Disorders and fighting have affected the country ever since, with more than one million people being displaced and thousands killed.The performance of the army in its recent battles with ethnic armed groups - some of which have ended in defeats and retreats - has sparked criticisms and doubts among its supporters.BBC"
It-should-be-obvious-to-everyone-The-ST-for-Meiteis-demand-is-alive-and-kicking-notwithstanding-the-totally,"It should be obvious to everyone. The ST for Meiteis demand is alive and kicking, notwithstanding the totally false premise on which the infamous Tribal Solidarity March of May 3, 2023 was held ostensibly against the directive of the High Court of Manipur to send the report sought by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee (STDCM), Meetei (Meitei) Tribe Union (MMTU), World Meetei Council (WMC), Kangleipak Kanba Lup (KKL) and others who back this call have more than made it clear that the demand still stands and it may just be a matter of time for this demand to be taken out on the streets and roads of Imphal. So far the State Government has not uttered a single word on this particular demand nor on the report sought by the Centre back in 2013, and the fact that such a report has been sought by the Centre may not have come to the notice of the public if not for the unyielding voice raised by the champions of ST for Meiteis call. It is thanks to the STDCM that The Sangai Express has also received a copy of the report sought by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and this is where questions should be raised on why the Congress Government back in 2013 slept over the matter and why the present BJP led Government is following this indifference. There could be many factors, but the Government has still not explained its stand on the matter. This is where so many things can be read into the silence of the Government and such a situation can only create rooms for conspiracy theory to fly thick and fast. This is about the silence of the Government but the question of greater import here is whether the ST for Meiteis champions such as the STDCM, MMTU and WMC have tried in any way to reach out to the other indigenous group of people, the Nagas, to present the case of the Meiteis. Not that it is the Nagas which has asked the report on the socio-economic conditions of the Meiteis and definitely it is not the Nagas or anyone else which will decide whether the Meiteis fit the bill to be tagged a Scheduled Tribe or not, but it never hurts to take everyone along as far as possible. Accordingly it is also important to ask whether there are any section of people from amongst the Meiteis who may be urging the Government not to act on the report sought by the Centre back in 2013. The fundamental point is, whether the ST for Meiteis advocates have reached out to anyone and tried to take everyone along with the idea of the Meiteis being tagged a Scheduled Tribe or not. If yes, then it is fine, but if the answer is in the negative then it would help to start reaching out now, though it is rather late in the day.That Meiteis need Constitutional protection is beyond arguments. Competition in the job market, protection of land etc need to be looked beyond Manipur. As a young man put it while sharing his ideas on the demand that the Meiteis be included in the ST category of the Constitution of India, the primary objective of reservation for the STs is to bring them into the National mainstream. Are the Meiteis in the mainstream by any standard ? The answer would be clear to anyone who understands how a Meitei feels or more importantly is made to feel once he or she steps out of the North East zone. As stated in an earlier commentary in this column, it is with a reason why categorising five communities of Assam as STs is one of the major points laid down by the pro-talk group of the ULFA in its negotiations with the Government of India and why the Union Home Ministry has agreed to this point. ST status for the five communities, namely, Moran, Motak, Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi and Tai-Ahom, will ensure land rights for the tribals, prevent alienation of the land and ensure greater representation of the indigenous folks in the Assam Assembly. The line of argument here should be easy to understand and this cannot be to the disadvantage of any indigenous community of Manipur. Why the Meiteis fulfil the criteria to be included in the ST category has been spelt out in this very column on more than one occasion, and perhaps it is because of this, that voices of opposition have been raised against any move to send the report sought by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Send the report and let Parliament decide should be the stand of any sane person."

The meeting chaired by MPCC K Meghachandra was attended by representatives of the party at the grassroot level and they discussed the strategy to make sure Congress candidates win both the Inner and Outer seats."

IMPHAL-Oct-11-Indigenous-rice-varieties-numbering-more-than-a-dozen-have-reportedly-vanished-from-Manipur-in-,"NE NowIMPHAL, Oct 11 : Indigenous rice varieties numbering more than a dozen have reportedly vanished from Manipur in the last 15 years.All Manipur Trained Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Promoters Consortium (AMAPCON) president Potshangbam Devkanta said this here on Friday.The indigenous rice varieties (seeds) which are said to have vanished from the State as per the records maintained by Devkanta are Chakhaoarongbi, Changli, Dular, Jessaria, Koimurali, Konjengphou, Kabo Chakhao, Huikapchakhao, Langmenti, Langmanbi, Langphou Phoungang, Mahulong, Naranphou, Phouren Tujombi, Phoudum Mubi, Phouren Phoudongba, Pangban, Singhara, Sagolyangba, Tumai Angouba and Tumai Nakuppi.Devkanta who won prestigious plant genome savior farmer award in 2012 for the first time from North East, said that many indigenous rice varieties grow in the region since time immemorial because of the State’s micro-climatic conditions.“For instance we cannot grow some of the rice varieties which grow well in hills when we plant in the valley areas as we cannot grow Shirui Lily, the State flower, in the valley due to their different climatic conditions,” Devkanta told Northeast Now.Shirui Lily grows in the hill range of Shirui peak in Manipur’s Ukhrul district.Despite India being one of world’s biggest producers of rice, little is known about the rich variety of rice that is grown across the country.Manipur, being a part of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot, is a major source for a wide variety of plants and rice varieties which can be grown in other parts.AMAPCON secretary general RK Ronendro said they’ve registered 272 different rice varieties including Chak-hao, black aromatic rice varieties for protection of plants varieties and farmers rights (PPV & FRA).Besides they have collected and submitted around 100 seed samples for conducting the grow-out test for identification of uniformity and stability (under PPV & FRA).The functionary of AMAPCON who had been conserving more than 300 indigenous seeds of rice, medicinal and aromatic plants, further said more than 70 different rice varieties in the fields apart from storing around 150 different indigenous rice seeds are being grown.However, the plant products are being lost at an alarming rate before discovery due to lack of knowledge, development and attention, Ronendro said.Considering the alarming situation and also to conserve indigenous seed varieties besides taking up steps to help secure genetic diversity for climate resilience, the first ever National Indigenous Seed Festival 2019 in North East will be held at Central Agricultural University at Iroishemba in Imphal from Saturday.The main objective of the festival is to exhibit different types of native indigenous seeds, which were earlier used before the modernization of agriculture, said an organiser."
New-Delhi-Mar-11The-Supreme-Court-on-Monday-directed-the-Manipur-Government-CBI-and-the-NIA-to-file-report,"New Delhi, Mar 11The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Manipur Government, CBI and the NIA to file reports elaborating on the status of probe and the charge sheets filed in cases of ethnic-violence to help it take a decision on whether the trials can commence in Assam or be undertaken in Manipur.The top Court, meanwhile, made it clear that it cannot issue directions to the State Government and law enforcement agencies to maintain law and order in Manipur in the wake of a spate of violent incidents, armed protests, blocking of the highways.“These are the matters where this Court cannot give directions. We cannot be issuing directions to the civil society organisations to maintain law and order…The State Government is there to maintain law and order,” said the bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwla and Manoj Misra.It asked Attorney General R Venkataramani, appearing for the State Government and the probe agencies, to take instructions on a recent report of the Justice Gita Mittal committee on the recent incidents of violence in the State.The apex Court-appointed three-Judge panel headed by Justice Mittal wanted the top Court to pass some orders following the recent incidents of violence.The Court asked the counsel, appearing for the panel, to provide a copy of the report to the Attorney General to take instructions on the issue.The top Court referred to a communication received from a special Judge in Guwahati, to whom the cases of violence in Manipur were transferred, for monitoring the probe.The trial Judge wanted a clarification about whether he can proceed with the trial in the cases which were transferred from Manipur to Guwahati in pursuance of the top Court’s directions issued on August 25, 2023.The Assam Court also wanted a direction as to how it should proceed to deal with juvenile offenders.“The updated status reports will be filed by the Manipur Government, the NIA and the CBI with regard to the investigations. The status report should indicate the charge sheets filed as of now and the stage of investigations in other cases,” the bench said.“Let us have an idea. We will take a call on whether the trial should take place in Assam or in Manipur,” the CJI said and permitted the Manipur Government also to file a response.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Manipur Government, said it wanted the trial to be held in the State as there was a marked improvement in the situation.“We want to know whether the cases were ripe for the trial or not,” the bench said, adding that a tabulated chart be filed on the status of cases.The top Court ordered the listing of petitions on Manipur violence after two weeks. The top Court had, on August 25 last year, ordered transfer of several Manipur violence cases being probed by the CBI, including the sexual assault case of two women seen in a viral video being paraded naked, to Assam.It had asked the Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court to nominate one or more judicial officers to deal with them.The apex Court had passed a slew of directions on judicial procedures, including virtual examination of victims and witnesses by Courts, saying they have been issued “at the present stage, bearing in mind the overall environment in Manipur and the need for ensuring a fair process of criminal justice administration”.“Both sides (Kuki and Meiteis) have been hurt …There have been victims in valleys, and in hills. It would be difficult for people who suffered in valleys to travel to hills, and the other way round. We are not on who suffered more, just the practical difficulty,” the CJI had said, adding the top Court will pass orders which will be fair to both sides.Prior to this, the Central Government had ordered a CBI probe into several cases of ethnic violence in Manipur.

How-MCSCCE-fiasco-of-2016-is-ruining-lives,"Imphal, Dec 1The Manipur Civil Service Combined Competitive (MCSCC) examination is considered to be one of the most coveted state competitive exams. Each year, thousands of aspirants apply with a dream to get through the civil service exams, but only a handful succeed.For 32-year-old Mercy (name changed), the eldest among her eight siblings, cracking the State civil service exam in her second attempt was not only fulfilling her childhood dream, but it was her route to a better life. Unfortunately, her dreams came crashing down with the abrupt termination followed by the quashing of the main exam of the 2016 MPSC. The episode even cost her marriage.“While I was pregnant, so many things happened emotionally. Because of the Court case, my husband’s family somehow knew that I was going to lose the job, and they made many attempts to make me leave the house. My husband was residing outside the State when I lost my job, and he refused to communicate with me. None of his family visited me when I gave birth, not even financial assistance,” said Mercy as she tried to control her emotions.She was only eight months old pregnant when she lost her job. Left with no other option, this young single mother has to juggle between paying off her loans, taking care of her baby and the Court case. As if the problems were not enough to tackle, she also has had to deal with trolling on social media. With all this happening at the same time, every day is a battle for her.Survival is also a challenge for differently-abled Suraj (name changed) as he has the responsibility of being the head of the household of feeding his family of four; provide education to his three children, manage the basic needs and continue fighting the legal battle.Eventually, this 47-year-old former Sub-Deputy Collector (SDC) took up home tuitions for neighbouring children to make ends meet and provide for his family.“After the High Court quashed our exam, it effectively annulled my two job appointments, one in Horticulture and Soil Department, which I had to leave before joining the civil service. And when the civil service appointment was annulled, I was left with nowhere to go. And without any financial backup, I had to feed my children and wife,"" said Suraj.Now with the increased cases of coronavirus, the situation is even more difficult for Suraj. He is in dire straits financially since the meagre income from the tuitions has also stopped as parents are reluctant to send their kids out of their homes.""I used to give tuitions to students as low as Class 6 standards and teach the basics of Maths, Science and English. Sometimes I pitied myself that my life has gone down this low. Somehow, I motivated myself with a thought that giving tuition is participating in the moulding of society in producing better children in the future. At the same time, I am getting some means of livelihood for sustenance,"" added Suraj.When the 26-year-old Johnson (name changed) cracked the MPSC examinations in his first attempt, his family thought that their prayers were finally answered. Born to a big family with both parents unemployed, Johnson was raised by his grandparents. His significant success story without attending any coaching institution but purely based on his self-preparation was heart-warming and inspired many youngsters in the town.However, things moved quickly and changed for the family since 2016 and Johnson is now subjected to harassment on social media alongside the struggle for his responsibilities.“The High Court judgment has landed heavily on the innocent candidates. This has impacted us in terms of our livelihood. For some people, cracking the exam is prestige and dignity, but people like me coming from a poor background, it is more of a livelihood. Because we are a big family and since my parents are both unemployed, I need to look after my siblings. This judgment comes with a shock to my family, including my grandparents since they raised me,” said Johnson, the youngest candidate who cleared the MPSC exams 2016.For Sarita (name changed), getting a job in her home State does not only mean that she could stay closer to her family but it also gave her a sense of responsibility and opportunity to be financially sound. When her appointment notice was revoked by the Court, only a few days were away from her marriage. After losing the job, this newly become mother is now finding it hard to pay off her student loans.“It drastically changed my life. I literally stopped going out and attending social gatherings because I feel that people are looking at me with such an impression that I have done something wrong. But that is not the truth. I have invested so many years of my life to clear this exam,” she said.                      Courtesy East Mojo"

Union-Home-Minister-Amit-Shah-on-Saturday-assured-Mizoram-Chief-Minister-Zoramthanga-that-Citizenship-Bill-will-,"Aizawl, Oct 6Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday assured Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga that Citizenship Bill will be suitably tweaked to safeguard the interests of the State amid fears that the legislation will result in ""illegal immigrants flooding the State"".Shah said that he will ensure that the CAB does not override a long-standing provision that checks the unabated entry of outsiders into the State. He placed special emphasis on protecting Mizoram's Inner Line Permit (ILP) in his meetings with Zoramthanga and top leaders of civil society groups.""As far as the Citizenship Amendment Bill is concerned, the Home Minister has assured that a new clause (related to the Inner Line Permit regime in Mizoram) will be incorporated in the draft Bill. We will work this out with the Home Ministry,"" Chief Minister Zoramthanga, who heads the Mizo National Front Government in the State, told reporters after his meeting with Amit Shah.The CM had in the interaction warned the Home Minister that the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 could open a ""floodgate of illegal immigrants"" in Mizoram, an official statement said. Zoramthanga met Shah, who is also the BJP National president, at the Raj Bhavan here and the two leaders discussed several other issues.The meeting ended on a “positive” note and Shah assured Mizoram would be empowered with more provisions for their safety if the CAB is enacted.This was Shah's first visit to Mizoram after assuming office. In his address to a huge gathering, Shah avoided the issues of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), which had led to protests in the State recently.Recently in Kolkata, Shah had declared that the party will “throw out all infiltrators one by one” by enforcing the NRC. He simultaneously clarified that no Hindu, Sikh, Jain or Buddhist need to worry because they will be accorded Indian citizenship beforehand with the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.Shah made a distinction between Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhists whom he classified as “refugees” while presumably consigning Muslims to the “infil- trator” status and threatening them with eviction.Several NGOs and other organisations under the banner of a coordination committee recently intensified the agitation against the visit of Shah saying that the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Bill will affect Mizoram and other parts of the North East.Shah who visited Mizoram with a day long programme highlighted the major initiatives taken by the BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre for the development of Mizoram and other parts of the North East.""During the tenure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi we have taken out bamboo from the list of forest resources and this is going to help the entire North East region by boosting the handicraft sector,"" said Shah.The Home Minister said that the Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken several steps for the development of Mizoram in the past five years which includes the inauguration of the 60 MW Tuirial hydro power project, providing rail connectivity to Vairabi in Mizoram, opening of border haats with Myanmar and steps to open the Kaladan multi model project. He said that while the erstwhile Congress Government had given only Rs 19,974 crore to Mizoram under the 13th Finance Commission, the State was given Rs 42,972 crore under the 14th Finance Commission.

New-Delhi-Dec-24INS-Imphal-the-indigenously-built-stealth-guided-missile-destroyer-equipped-with-BrahMos-s,"New Delhi, Dec 24INS Imphal, the indigenously-built stealth guided missile destroyer equipped with BrahMos surface-to-surface missiles, will be commissioned into the Indian Navy on Tuesday in a boost to its maritime capability amid China’s increasing forays into the Indian Ocean region.It is the first warship to have been named after a city from the North Eastern region, the approval for which was accorded by the President in April 2019.The warship will be commissioned at a ceremony in the naval dockyard in Mumbai in the presence of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, officials said.The naming of the ship after the capital city of Manipur underlines the importance of the North Eastern region for National security and prosperity, they said.A guided missile destroyer with a displacement of 7,400 tonnes and overall length of 164 meters, Imphal is a potent and versatile platform equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors, including surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes.Powered by Combined Gas and Gas (COGAG) propulsion, the ship is capable of achieving speeds in excess of 30 knots (56 km/hour).The ship boasts of a high indigenous content of approximately 75 per cent that includes BrahMos surface-to-surface missiles, medium range surface-to-air missiles, anti-submarine indigenous rocket launchers and 76mm super rapid gun mount.INS Imphal was delivered to the Indian Navy on October 20 after completion of a rigorous and comprehensive trial programme both in the harbour and at sea.Subsequently, the ship successfully test-fired the extended-range supersonic BrahMos missile last month, a first for any indigenous warship before commissioning.Following this milestone, the ship’s crest was unveiled by Defence Minister Singh in New Delhi in the presence of the Chief Minister of Manipur.Upon commissioning, INS Imphal will join the Western Naval Command.The commissioning ceremony will mark the formal induction into the Navy of the third of the four ‘Visakhapatnam’ class destroyers, indigenously designed by the Indian Navy’s in-house organisation, Warship Design Bureau.The ship was constructed by Mazagon Dock Limited, Mumbai. “Imphal can rightfully be regarded as one of the most potent warships to have been constructed in India—a testament to India’s growing shipbuilding prowess in pursuit of the National vision of ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’,” an Indian Navy spokesperson said.The ship is fitted with a modern surveillance radar which provides target data to the gunnery weapon systems of the ship.The ship’s anti-submarine warfare capabilities are provided by the indigenously developed rocket launchers, torpedo launchers and anti-submarine warfare helicopters.“The ship is equipped to fight under Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare conditions and has a high degree of automation and stealth features further enhancing her combat capability and survivability,” the Navy said.It said the time taken to build INS Imphal and for her trials is the shortest for any indigenous destroyer.Imphal’s keel was laid on May 19, 2017 and the ship was launched into water on April 20, 2019.“INS Imphal sailed out for her maiden sea trials on April 28 and has completed a comprehensive schedule of trials, both in the harbour and at sea, leading up to its delivery on October 20 within a record time frame of six months — the fastest for a ship of its size,” it said in a statement.“The ship Imphal will have the unique distinction of being the largest and the most advanced destroyer to be ever named after a city from the North East. This is a befitting tribute to Manipur’s sacrifices and contributions in India’s freedom struggle — be it the Anglo-Manipur War of 1891; or Netaji Subash Chandra Bose’s hoisting of the INA flag for the first time on April 14, 1944 at Moirang,” it said.It said the commissioning of INS Imphal, thus, underscores the salience and contribution of the city of Imphal, the State of Manipur and the larger North Eastern region to National security, sovereignty and prosperity.                  PTI"
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-19-The-Irabot-Foundation-Manipur-IFM-has-categorically-stated-that-the-f,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 19: The Irabot Foundation Manipur (IFM) has categorically stated that the farmers of the State would stay away from the 18th Lok Sabha elections until and unless all their rights are secured and a special package is given to them.Speaking to media persons at Manipur Press Club here today, IFM president Kh Gopen Luwang said that the people of Manipur have been suffering extreme misery for the past 11 months. On account of the protracted violence, farmers engaged in agricultural and other allied activities including fishery have incurred heavy losses, he said.Although a small compensation has been sanctioned for farmers who could not cultivate paddy last year, no such compensation has been sanctioned as yet for farmers engaged in horticulture, sericulture, fishery etc, Gopen said.Even before the protracted violent crisis, farmers were facing several issues like Covid-19 restrictions, floods and droughts. Until and unless a special package is sanctioned for the farmers, it would be hard for the State to tide over the present economic woes, he said.Until and unless a special package is sanctioned, farmers of the State would/must stay from the Lok Sabha elections, the IFM president asserted.It is a matter of grave concern that the upcoming Lok Sabha election has been made the central issue while the woes and suffering of the victims of the violent crisis and the farmers are being marginalised, he said.Although there was unity among the people at the height of the violence, the upcoming election has started polarising the people. This is unacceptable to the IFM, he said.Pointing out that HSLC Exam 2024 is going on at present, he appealed to all political parties to restrain their election campaigns, and refrain from polarising the farmers."

The-transition-has-been-smooth-very-smooth-A-politician-in-the-making-and-this-about-sums-up-Kuldiep-Singh-,"The transition has been smooth, very smooth. A politician in the making and this about sums up Kuldiep Singh, as Manipur knows him since the last more than 8 months. If one has to address a sensitive point then the best thing would be to confuse the people and the Security Advisor to the Government of Manipur seems to have mastered this art in just a little over 8 months. Maybe it is the unique but bloody situation here which has compelled him to make the transition from the khaki to a politician in the making and nothing perhaps underlines this point better than the categorical ‘Myanmar militants not involved’ stand spelt out on January 9 to ‘might be involved’ turn around on January 18. A man hand picked by Delhi just one day after Manipur went up in flames on May 3, 2023, it is more than clear that Kuldiep Singh is here not so much as the Security Advisor to the Government of Manipur, but an emissary sent by the Centre to do as bade by the political leaders of Delhi. This was what emerged very clearly in his address to the media on January 18, even as Manipur reeled under the impact of the renewed offensives launched by Kuki militants at Moreh and at different parts of the State. Keep the security engaged at Moreh and then pick up the soft targets in other parts such as at Bishnupur district. Precise and clinical and as a man heading the Unified Command and as the Security Advisor to the Government of Manipur, it should have been more than clear that such clinical and ‘professional’ attacks could not have been possible without outside assistance. That the Security Advisor preferred to take cover under terms such as ‘might be involved’ reeks of politicalspeak. The bottomline is, this is not the time to take refuge under words and terms and jargons  for here is a situation which has dragged on for more than 8 months and which has claimed hundreds of lives. The Security Advisor also steered clear of answering or giving information on the sophisticated guns used by the Kuki militants. Were such guns deposited at the designated camps of the SoO outfits is a question for which no answer has been forthcoming. No explanation so far and surely the unfolding situation cannot be addressed by taking refuge in highly unreliable terms such as ‘might be involved’. What Manipur needs right now are some clear cut answers. If the Security Advisor is under the impression that taking refuge under vague terms or using vague words is the answer then there is no reason why the violence should drag on for over 8 months. As the Security Advisor what are the advices that have been offered to the State Government to deal with the fresh offensives from the Kuki militants ? What plans have been worked out to neutralise the ‘might  be involved’ armed militants from across the border ? The people want an answer to this and one hopes the answer is not buried under an avalanche of vague words and terms, dictated by political compulsion.Delhi should also not lose sight of the significance of ‘might be involved’ take of Kuldiep Singh. It is external aggression. It cannot be more plain and simple than this.  The question is whether the demand of geo-politics, the China equation vis-a-vis its hold and influence over Myanmar, should be allowed to override the interests of Manipur. The very fact that this question has been raised should arouse Delhi to the fact that Manipur is not blind or ignorant of the larger scheme of things at play and this is where there is the distinct uncomfortable thought on whether it is in Delhi’s interest to prolong the crisis here. Prolong the crisis in the sense that the Kuki militants are given a free hand, prompting Central security forces such as the Assam Rifles to remain onlookers. If the Security Advisor can go to such length as stating ‘Myanmar militants might be involved’ in the series of offensives, then what is the Assam Rifles doing, the force tasked with guarding the border of India ?  Going by what the Security Advisor has had to say, how did the possibility of heavily armed militants crossing the border and entering India, going on the offensive, meticulously  picking out the State forces from the Central force personnel, emerge ? The answer can and should come from the chairman of the Unified Command."

Prabhat-KishoreAfter-the-independence-of-India-Bihar-has-witnessed-ups-and-downs-of-various-political-parti,"Prabhat KishoreAfter the independence of India, Bihar has witnessed ups and downs of various political parties as well as leaders. In the pre-Mandal era, ie before 1990,  power politics was dominated by the Congress Party as a political institution and the upper castes in terms of leadership. In the post-Mandal era, the scenario completely reversed and it is being dominated by two powerful regional socialist background parties RJD and JDU under the leadership of Laloo Prasad and Nitish Kumar respectively, both belonging to backward classes.Before the first general election in 1952, Sri Krishna Singh, a Bhumihar leader, led the provincial Governments in Bihar since 20th July 1937 to 31st October 1939 and 2nd April 1946 to 1952. His leadership continued after 1952 and 1957 Vidhan Sabha elections till his demise on 31st January 1961;  although, dissident activities have been unsuccessfully launched by his deputy and Finance Minister Anugrah  Narayan Sinha, a Rajput leader. After the demise of Sri Babu, Deep Narayan Singh, a Rajput, served as acting CM since 1st February 1961 to 18th February 1961. Blessed with the Central leadership, Binoda Nand Jha,  a Brahmin, was elected as leader of Congress Legislature Party and sworn in as the CM on 18th February 1961. In 1962, third general election was fought under the leadership of Pandit Jha  and he continued as CM after the election.The dissident activities were intensified by Satyen-dra Narayan Sinha, son of Late Anugrah Narayan Sinha, and consequently BN Jha had to step down under the “Kamraj Yojana” of the Congress Party. Following his resignation, for the first time in the history of Congress, election for the leader of the legislature party was held between two social group candidates Birchand Patel, a Kurmi (supported by BN Jha) and Krishna Balabh Sahay, a Kayasth (supported by SN Sinha). Birchand Patel lost due to betrayal of  some of his close associates. KB Sahay led the Government from 2nd October 1963 to 5th March 1967.After a long span of 20-years after independence, about 85% backward & Dalit  population were bereft of not only in the Government services & institutions, but in every walk of life. Intensive campaign for their awakening as well as reservation in Government jobs & institutions was being carried out by Congress leader Deo Sharan Singh, a Kurmi (Ex-chairman of Bihar Vidhan Parishad) under the banner of “Backward Foundation”. In the meantime, experiment of “backwardism” for political control was being done by the socialists like Ram Manohar  Lohia and Bhola Prasad Singh with the slogan “Sansopa Ne Bandhi Ganth, Pichhra Pawe Sau Mein Santh”. Under such circumstances, the third general election of 1967 proved to be a  “political waterloo”.The Congress fell short of the majority figure and lost power in several States including Bihar.The first non-Congress Government was sworn in on 5th March 1967 under the leadership of Mahamaya Pd Sinha, a Kayasth, of Jan Kranti Dal. The alliance was a mix up of conflicting ideology parties like Jansangh, Samyukt Socialist Party (SSP), Praja Socialist Party (PSP), Communist Party and Kamakhya Narayan Sinha,  ex-King of Ram-garh. It was very tedious for Mahamaya Babu to keep these ideologically opposite parties united for long time and  ultimately, the Government fell by 13 votes in the Vidhan Sabha on 25th January 1968. Bindeshwari  Prasad Mandal (the chairman of Mandal Commission) was an SSP MP and joined Mahamaya Pd. Ministry, but was not elected as MLA or MLC. To become a member of Vidhan Mandal his 6-month deadline was only 10 days left. On the initiative of Congress,  BP Mandal, a Yadav, formed “Shoshit Samaj Dal” to become the CM. So, first Satish Pd Singh, a Koiri, of  his party was sworn in as  the CM, whose tenure was for just 5 days (28th Jan 1968 to 1st Feb 1968) and  Sri Mandal was nominated to the Vidhan Parishad.(To be contd)"

Climate Change is a global crisis.”“I want to dedicate this award to the people of my birthplace Manipur and my country India as well as to all my fellow climate activist friends from across the globe.”, she added.Nowadays, climate conflicts pose the greatest development challenges in the world. Children and education systems are often on the front line of these climate conflicts. The rise in violent due to water scarcity, loss of species, plants and ecosystem and natural disasters like flood, drought, etc. in many parts of the world and radicalization represent a significant threat to all of us.Members of radical groups adopt increasingly extreme political, economic, social, cultural, and religious ideologies and use undemocratic and violent means to achieve their objectives. South Asian countries also face the challenge of objectively addressing deeply rooted structural causes of conflicts emanating from historical injustices, marginalization and corruption on finding environmental answers.“The oceans are in a state of emergency”, she warned. “Entire marine ecosystems are vanishing with the warming of the seas, and as the waste of our world empties into our waters, we face the devastating crisis of plastic pollution.”“We are a disease that is infecting our planet.”“The people will hold our governments and corporate powers accountable for the destruction you are allowing to our environment,” she said.It can be noted that Licypriya is demanding to enact the climate change law in India and all countries of the World to transform words and papers into action to combat the climate change by drawing the attention of the World leaders.The IYC recognised annual prize is in honour of what it called ‘Mandela’s contribution to resolving conflicts and promoting race relations, human rights and reconciliation.’ A total of 3 individuals got the Mandela Peace Prize 2019, 9 got the India Peace Prize 2019 & 79 youth leaders got the National Youth Icon Award 2019.

The-dramatic-decline-from-60-per-cent-in-1971-to-just-44-per-cent-in-2011-will-have-serious-socio-economic-and,"The dramatic decline from 60 per cent in 1971 to just 44 per cent in 2011 will have serious socio-economic and political implications. This is indeed a tectonic change in the demography of Manipur as pointed out by the World Meetei Council or WMC. If the WMC’s assertion that another community has overtaken the indigenous Naga community as the second largest community in Manipur is true, it is a very alarming revelation which will have far-reaching consequences. Comprising just 44 per cent of the total population of Manipur, Meiteis no longer enjoy the majority it once did. With the population of one particularly community and their cognate tribes rising exponentially, the indigenous Meitei and Naga communities may soon be reduced to minorities in their own homeland. This is indeed a wake-up call to all stakeholders. Given the fast changing demography of Manipur, the popular demand for enlistment of Meitei in the Scheduled Tribe category merits full attention and appropriate, urgent actions from the authorities. There is some truth in the WMC’s assertion that the fate of 15 lakh odd Meiteis lies in the hands of the Chief Minister because the Government of India or more precisely the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes can act only when the state government sends the necessary recommendation along with the requisite documents. Interestingly, it was Chief Minister N Biren who stated on the floor of the Manipur Legislative Assembly in March 2019 that the growing fear among Meitei community of possible complete marginalization in near future is genuine and their demand for granting Schedule Tribe status is quite reasonable. The Chief Minister also announced that the state government will act soon and positively but alas nothing has come out of the Chief Minister’s announcement so far.The basic arguments which are driving the campaign for inclusion of the Meitei community in ST list are; the community constitutes a microscopic minority of the vast multitude of Indian population and their tiny living space has been shrinking day by day in the absence of a constitutional safeguard, Meitei culture and identity have been rendered extremely vulnerable to the all pervasive juggernaut of globalization and incessant influx from different directions and they (Meitei) are fast losing the status of being the majority community in Manipur. The counter arguments run like this; Meiteis are a relatively advanced community, there was a glorious Meitei kingdom and they have a refined culture with a language and script of their own. But a thorough analysis will reveal that the relative advancement of Meitei community over other communities of the state is a rather misplaced notion in this age of globalization. As for the glorious Meitei kingdom, it is a thing of the past. If we must talk about the so called refined Meitei culture, it is being bombarded by foreign cultural elements from all directions. Upholding one’s culture and identity becomes a serious challenge when a community is degraded economically and politically. It becomes impossible to protect one’s identity if his/her community’s living space is shrinking. This is exactly what is happening to the Meitei community who inhabits the Imphal Valley which is just around 2300 Sq Kms. Whereas the Meiteis are prohibited from buying land in the hill districts, everyone, both local people and non-local people can buy land and settle in any part of the Imphal Valley. This is a grave injustice. If a consensus can be reached on the issue of granting ST status to Meiteis, the issue will have its solution then and there. Even if the desired consensus remains elusive, the state government can throw the ball to the government of India’s court by sending the necessary recommendation along with the requisite documents. After all, it is the Government of India which can/will decide the issue."
Let-it-be-clear-It-s-not-the-judiciary-including-the-High-Court-of-Manipur-or-the-Supreme-Court-of-India-whi,"Let it be clear. It s not the judiciary, including the High Court of Manipur or the Supreme Court of India which can direct the inclusion of Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribe list of the Constitution. What the High Court of Manipur did was to direct the Government to reply to the information sought by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs on the socio-economic status of the Meiteis to consider whether the said community can be listed in the ST category or not. It was in May 2013 that the Union Tribal Ministry had sought a report on the socio-economic conditions of the Meiteis so that the growing demand that the said community be enlisted in the ST category may be studied, and it was on the basis of this intimation from the Centre, that the High Court of Manipur had directed the State Government to send the report. Send the sought report was its brief. However as things have panned out, especially after the All Tribal Students’ Union, Manipur (ATSUM) backed by the so called Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum organised the Tribal Solidarity March on May 3, 2023, a totally false, lop sided narrative was spun out to the effect that the Kukis had risen as one against the ST for Meiteis directive of the High Court of Manipur. Even today with clever use of words and phrase, especially of the legal kind, attempts are being made to confuse the people with tales manufactured to the effect that the High Court of Manipur has issued yet another order neutralising the earlier report sought by the Union Tribal Affairs Ministry. As a person from the legal profession and who happens to belong to the Congress, Bhupenda Meitei has put it, the order of the High Court of Manipur had to do only with the earlier directive that the State Government send the report sought by the Centre within four weeks. The four weeks directive was issued sometime in March 2023 and a case had since then been pending with the Court, and the latest order had to do with deleting the time frame of 4 weeks set earlier. In short it had nothing to do with the report sought by the Union Tribal Affairs Ministry from the State Government but only the time frame. This much should be clear to all those who have been keeping a close and interested tab on the ST for Meiteis demand raised and championed by the Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee, Manipur, the World Meetei Council, Meetei/Meitei Tribe Union, Kang-leipak Kanba Lup and others.The Sangai Express has been at forefront in backing the ST for Meiteis call and with good reasons. That the Meiteis fulfil the criteria to be included in the ST category of the Constitution of India has been laid clear on more than one occasion and it would help for everyone, especially those who have been opposing the ST for Meiteis call to look beyond Manipur. The addition of any new community in the ST group would mean tougher competition for those who are already in it and if the inclusion of the Meiteis in the ST category is to be opposed, then it should not be forgotten that it was only some time back that the Centre decided to include six communities of Assam in the ST list. The pro-talk group of the ULFA has also come to the point that the survival of the Assamese rest on the six communities getting the ST tag and hence Constitutional protection. Now if the demand that the Meiteis be included in the ST category is going to be opposed so strongly, then how about the inclusion of the six communities from Assam ? Wouldn’t that throw the field of competition in the job market wider ? This is where the argument that all need to look beyond Manipur should be understood. Internal arrangements can always be made for the indigenous people, in so far as the job sector is concerned, just as Nagaland has its own categorisation of advanced and backward tribes. No reason why Manipur cannot have its own version of valley and hill tribes and this is a point that may be studied minutely. Opposing for the sake of opposing will not exactly help anyone. A Constitutionally protected Meitei is what is behind the demand for ST for Meiteis. Land grab, trying to usurp the rights of existing tribal groups, etc are all lies cooked up to suit their own narratives which have been sold to the world."

Naypyidaw-Jan-30-Four-members-of-the-Myanmar-security-services-including-a-Brigadier-General-were-shot-dead,"Naypyidaw, Jan 30Four members of the Myanmar security services including a Brigadier General were shot dead by sniper fire on Monday as their helicopter prepared to land, a military source told AFP.Brigadier General Aye Min Naung, his personal security officer and two pilots were shot by a ""sniper"" as their helicopter prepared to land at eastern Thinganny-inaung town near Myawaddy on the Thai border, the security source said.The Brigadier General later died, the source said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.Two other servicemen on the helicopter had ""survived,"" they added, without giving details.The source did not say how many snipers had shot at the helicopter, or attribute blame for the shooting.The junta has clashed regularly around Myawaddy with ethnic minority fighters and allied ""People's Defence Force"" groups in recent months.Local media published images purporting to show the aftermath of the incident that showed a small helicopter lying on its side in a field.One local outlet said the helicopter was a twin-engined Eurocopter 365.The Brigadier General is the latest high-ranking officer to be killed on the frontlines as the junta battles opponents of its coup across swathes of the country.In November, the Brigadier General of a light infantry battalion was killed by a bomb dropped from a drone in Monekoe near the China border amid clashes, a military source told AFP.Six Brigadier Generals are currently in custody for surrendering with more than 2,000 troops to an alliance of ethnic minority fighters in the neighbouring Kokang region.In November, a light fighter jet, carrying two pilots crashed in the east of the country where fighting is ongoing, with anti-coup forces claiming they had shot it down.The junta said engine failure had caused the crash.Myanmar has been riven by conflict since the 2021 military coup, with multiple armed ethnic groups battling the junta on different fronts.

Ultimately-it-is-Delhi-s-call-but-that-has-not-stopped-the-demand-that-the-Suspension-of-Operation-pact-signe,"Ultimately it is Delhi’s call, but that has not stopped the demand that the Suspension of Operation pact signed with the Kuki militant groups, which come under the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and the United People’s Front (UPF), be scrapped. The Kuki-Zo community on the other hand must be banking hard on the SoO dialogue to realise the Separate Administration call, although the integrity of Manipur is clearly mentioned in the clause of the tripartite agreement signed between the Centre, the State Government and the Kuki outfits in 2008. Note the stress on 2008 for it was only in 2008 that Imphal was convinced to come on board, while the SoO agreement was actually inked between the Kuki outfits and the Government of India in 2005. Again the italicised was convinced should tell the story of how Imphal was made to come on board the SoO pact. This is the story of the SoO pact for the past 15 years or so and the most stupefying point is there is no visible reason to understand why a peace pact should be signed with a bunch of renegades  who have never ever raised the battle cry against the security forces or raised any demand outside the Constitution of India. This is where rooms have been created for conspiracy theories to fly thick and fast and the more one tries to understand the rationale of the peace pact with the Kuki militants the more it seems to come close to the understanding that the Kuki militants are being fed and nurtured to help neutralise the armed groups of Manipur and the Naga rebels, particularly the NSCN (IM). Plus remember the Zomi Revolutionary Army is headed by a gentleman who has come from Myanmar and set up shop here in Manipur. Now with Manipur up in flames since the evening of May 3, 2023 and with more than enough indications that cadres of the SoO outfits are in the thick of it all, having killed State police personnel as well as Central security personnel, the demand that the SoO pact be abrogated is gaining ground. The urgency in the ‘Scrap SoO’ demand can be understood in the backdrop of the fact that the pact is set to be reviewed by the end of this month, probably by the 28th or 29th of February and this demand should be viewed in the backdrop of the recent decision to do away with the Free Movement Regime (FMR) as well as the announcement that the Indo-Myanmar border would be fenced.The rationale behind the decision to do away with the FMR and fence the Indo-Myanmar border should be understood and stretch this understanding a little bit, it should be clear that these two steps would not mean much as long as the armed outfits are engaged in a political dialogue with the Government. This is the line of thinking for Manipur and it is not without reason. It was with a reason why Imphal decided to withdraw from the SoO agreement with the Zomi Revolutionary Army and the Kuki National Army and it would do good for Delhi to try and understand why Imphal decided to take this line. Again it is with a reason why Imphal sees the hands of the SoO groups in the infiltration from across the border as well as the emergence of new settlements in Reserved and Protected Forests, with B Sonjang village emerging as the right example. Remember the massive protests and rallies organised across all Kuki dominated places to decry the eviction of the said village from a Protected Forest and things should fall into place. Using the illegal immigrants as labour force for poppy plantations as well as for arms running and drug trafficking under the influence and directives of the SoO outfits are charges that have been raised and perhaps these charges can be validated by what a Kuki gentleman, a certain Paolienlal Haokip, wrote back in 2002 in a publication of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies under the heading ‘Suffering in oblivion : Burmese refugees in North East Region of India.’ Citing many factors, Mr Haokip in the said article underlined, ‘some among them took to drugs and arms trafficking across the border’ and capped this off by assessing that 20,000 Kukis entered Manipur as refugees. This was in 1967, as mentioned in the said article and there is nothing to suggest that things have changed. It is against this reality that the call to scrap the SoO pact has been raised and which Delhi should note."

Imphal-N-Delhi-Jan-25A-unique-market-in-Manipur-where-the-traders-are-only-women-will-be-shown-at-the-Repub,"Imphal/N Delhi, Jan 25A unique market in Manipur where the traders are only women will be shown at the Republic Day parade tableau of the North East State on Friday.Ima Keithel, or Mother's Market, in the State capital Imphal is an important example of nari shakti (women power) where women's central role in socio-economic activities drives economic development, the tableau-makers said in a statement.The parade in central Delhi's Kartavya Path this year is themed on Viksit Bharat (developed Bharat), with a focus on women empowerment.The Manipur tableau also shows a woman collecting lotus stems from Loktak lake, one of the largest lakes in the North East region, 50 km south of Imphal. Women are seen rowing small boats and collecting lotus stems.Named ""Thambalgi Langla"" or Lotus Threads in Meiteilon, a father and son from Imphal West designed the tableau. N Ibohal Meetei, the chief designer, in the statement said several newly inaugurated Ima Keithels across Manipur have empowered thousands of women to achieve financial independence.The chief designer's son and assistant, Ningombam Sanjib Meitei, pointed to how Ima Keithel fostered the ""spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship"" among the women of Manipur. Some of Manipur's globally acclaimed woven cloth made by women include the Leirum Phi, Moirang Phi, and Mayek-Naibi. Two of them have Geographical Indication (GI) tags, which is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and have qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.""Continuing this legacy, Bijiyashanti Tongbram from Thanga village, nestled in the heart of Loktak lake, recently became India's first lotus silk producer,"" Sanjib Meitei said in the statement.Lotus silk is counted among one of the finest fabrics produced in the country.""She not only employs many local women, but also exports lotus silk to other countries, establishing India as the world's fourth Nation to export lotus silk... bringing immense pride to the nation. Her remarkable achievements earned her the prestigious 'Changemaker of the North East 2020' award,"" Sanjib Meitei said.A building at the end of the tableau is a replica of Ima Keithel. The sides of the tableau's end are decorated with popular fabrics, including the two GI-tagged ones.The tableaux of other States also focus on women power and empowerment.Madhya Pradesh's tableau will show what the state has achieved by integrating women directly into the development process through its welfare schemes. Madhya Pradesh's first woman fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force - Squadron Leader Avani Chaturvedi - will be seen standing beside a fighter plane model.Rajasthan's tableau will be a demonstration of the development of women's handicraft industries along with the festive culture of the state. Haryana's tableau will show the government programme 'Mera Parivar, Meri Pehchan'.Odisha's tableau will also display women's involvement in handicrafts and handloom sectors; Chhattisgarh's will reflect women's dominance in the tribal communities of Bastar.Andhra Pradesh will showcase transforming school education and making students globally competitive; Ladakh's tableau will show the Indian women ice hockey team, whose players also include from Ladakh.  NDTV"

Unarguably-the-biggest-festival-of-the-indigenous-Meitei-people-Ningol-Chakkouba-was-given-the-go-by-in-2023,"Unarguably the biggest festival of the indigenous Meitei people, Ningol Chakkouba was given the go by in 2023 amid the ongoing ethnic clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis-qualified by the terms illegal immigrants and militants. Christmas was a muted affair with many Churches in Imphal  cancelling the dos usually associated with the festival such as Christmas trees, Stars being put up at private residences of many including the non-Christians, no Christmas carols, in fact a quiet affair it was with the Christmas Church service winding up with prayers for peace and normalcy to return. Go back a little earlier than December 25, 2023 and Diwali was again muted, with no decorative lights adorning the shops and houses, as is the practise in other years. In fact Manipur turned its back on all festivities to show solidarity with those killed, made to disappear, displaced and surviving in different relief centres and the same state of affairs continues. It is against this backdrop that different political parties are gearing up for the coming Lok Sabha elections, for which notification is expected to be issued anytime on one of the coming days. Manipur will go to polls for sure, but it will be something far removed from the slogan coined by The Times of India some time back, ‘Dance of Democracy.’ There will be no dance but yet at the same time the coming Lok Sabha election has elicited a sort of interests not seen in the previous election years-certainly not in 2019, 2014, 2009 or 2004. At the moment all eyes are on the big two-the BJP and the Congress-and names are already flying thick and fast and this is more so in the case of the Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency. As things stand at the moment, four personalities are in the race for the Congress ticket in Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency while there is just one for the Outer Constituency. As for the BJP, nothing is as yet forthcoming giving more room for speculations to do the round and in a way adding to the interests being kicked up by the dust of the pre-poll fever. Early days yet but as far as the Inner Constituency is concerned, the ongoing ethnic clash and the  issues associated with it, such as the ‘misguided’ understanding given to the clubbing of districts as hill districts or valley districts,  the existence of a ‘mini Assembly’ within the Manipur Legislative Assembly in the form of the Hill Area Committee, a point so succinctly brought forth by one of the intending Congress candidates in the Inner seat, the provision/s that prohibit/s the Meiteis from settling in the hills of Manipur while the valley which comprises only 10 or less percent of the total geographical size of Manipur is free for anyone to settle, are issues which the people would want an open debate on to see where the candidate and the political party he or she represents stand.Much will also depend on how the two political parties have responded to the ongoing ethnic clash. As the party in power at New Delhi and Imphal, the BJP may be hard pressed to answer or explain why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thus far preferred to remain silent on the ongoing clash, a silence that many have come to interpret as being indifferent. Remains to be seen how this may be blunted by the positive moves that New Delhi under the BJP has taken for Manipur such as the extension of the Inner Line Permit System, the suspension of the Free Movement Regime on the Indo-Myanmar border, the promise to fence the border, the suspension of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in many areas across Manipur, the correct narratives that have been championed by magazines or publications which are understood to come under the right wing umbrella but be sure the seeming indifference of the Prime Minister to the disaster that has gripped Manipur for the last 10 months is a ghost that the saffron party will be hard pressed to exorcise. These are some likely points that may emerge as the poll activities intensify in the coming days, but what marks out the coming Lok Sabha election is the kind of interests it has evoked. One hopes that enough lessons have been learnt from the past, for example the last Parliamentary elections that have been mentioned earlier, and the people lay down the agenda for the election. Tell the candidates what it is that the people want and not rest satisfied with just hearing what they intend to do once elected.

DJ-NarainContd-from-previous-issueThe-Centre-has-now-drawn-out-an-ambitious-plan-for-transforming-more-tha,"DJ NarainContd from previous issueThe Centre has now drawn out an ambitious plan for transforming more than 1300 railway stations in the country as ‘Amrit Bharat Stations’.The mission got a fillip, when in August 2023, Prime Minister, Shri Naren-dra Modi laid the founda- tion stone for the redevelopment of 508 Railway Stations across the country. Being redeveloped at a cost of more than Rs 24,470 crores, these 508 stations are spread across 27 states and union territories, including 55 each in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, 49 in Bihar, 44 in Maharashtra, 37 in West Bengal, 34 in Madhya Pradesh, 32 in Assam, 25 in Odisha, 22 in Punjab, 21 each in Gujarat and Telangana, 20 in Jharkhand, 18 each in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, 15 in Haryana, 13 in Karnataka among others.Results that are being seentoday, are an outcome of series of efforts and management initiatives being undertaken especially since 2019.Railway Minister Ash-wini Vaishnaw has gone on record saying “Our Prime Minister has a huge vision for station redevelopment. When we went with the original designs, he didn’t approve the designs. He told us to design the stations for 50 years ahead. So, we went back to the drawing board, redesigned the entire thing, and then started the construction. So, today we are doing the world’s largest station redevelopment program. 1309 stations are getting redeveloped”.Development/redevelopment of Railway Stations is complex in nature, involving safety of passengers & trains and requires various statutory clearances such as fire clearance, heritage, tree cutting, airport clearance etc. The progress also gets affected due to brown field related challenges such as shifting of utilities, infringements, operation of trains without hindering passenger movement, restrictions due to works carried out in close proximity of high voltage power lines etc. Wide spread consultations with Urban/Local Bodies and other stakeholders, experts, officers arebeing done for clearances required from concerned authorities for station development work.Modernisation of over 1300 Railway Stations is a colossal task and an all-inclusive thorough process has gone behind scientific redevelopment of these stations with speed and scale. The designing has been done in a holistic manner with discussions at the various levels before issuing tenders. Moreover, a standard tender document was curated and shared with all so as to ensure completion of work in a time bound manner. Indian Railways merged the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation for optimization of redevelopment work. Various top domain experts, Architects and piling agencies were empaneled for suitable use by all divisions and zonal offices. Creation of GatishaktiDirectorates in the Zones and Headquarter,besides training of over 9000 personnel for this, has also facilitated in streamlining and speeding up of the processes.The scheme involves preparation of Master Plans and their implementation in phases to improve the amenities at the stations like improvement of station access, circulating areas, waiting halls, toilets, lift/escalators as necessary, cleanliness, free WiFi, kiosks for local products through schemes like ‘One Station One Product”, better passenger information systems, executive lounges, nominated spaces for business meetings, landscaping etc. keeping in view the necessity at each such station.The scheme also envisages improvement of building, integrating the station with both sides of the city, multimodal integration, amenities for Divyangjans, sustainable and environment friendly solutions. Every station will have a spacious roof plaza with all passenger amenities at one place along with spaces for retail, cafeterias, recreational facilities.Master plan has been prepared for smooth movement of traffic, with adequate parking facilities and efforts would be there to ensure its integration with other modes of transportation like metro, bus etc.Green Building Techniques will be used, with solar energy, water conservation/recycling and improved tree cover.There will be segregation of arrival/departures, Clutter free platforms, improved surfaces, fully covered platforms.Unprecedented transformation of Indian Railway Stations is going to make every Indian proud and every tourist marvel at the pace the change that has taken place.

NEPALGUNJ-Nov-4-At-least-157-people-were-killed-in-an-overnight-earth-quake-that-struck-a-remote-pocket-of,"NEPALGUNJ, Nov 4At least 157 people were killed in an overnight earth-quake that struck a remote pocket of Nepal, officials said Saturday, as security forces rushed to assist with rescue efforts.The 6.4 magnitude quake hit isolated western districts of the Himalayan republic late Friday and was measured by the US Geological Survey at just 18 kilometres (11 miles) deep.The force of the tremor jolted households awake and flattened mud houses in communities across the impact site. ""It came when we were sleeping,"" Kamala Oli, a woman cradling her infant child at a hospital treating survivors, told AFP.""There were three of us in the house. Only two of us lived,"" she added, without giving further details.Dozens of survivors with fractures and head injuries were raced for treatment to a hospital in Nepalgunj, a small city near the Indian border.The quake was felt as far away as India's capital New Delhi, nearly 500 kilometres from the epicentre.""105 people have died in Jajarkot and 38 in Rukum,"" National police spokesman Kuber Kathayat told AFP, referring to the two districts hit worst by the quake. Authorities had tallied more than 100 others injured across both districts, he added.Security forces have been deployed on foot and in helicopters to assist with search and rescue operations.""The remoteness of the districts makes it difficult for information to get through,"" Karnali Province police spokesman Gopal Chandra Bhattarai told AFP.""Some roads had been blocked by damage, but we are trying to reach the area through alternate routes.""  The district hospital was packed with residents bringing in injured victims.Human and physical damagesNepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal arrived at the site of the quake on Saturday after expressing his ""deep sorrow over the human and physical damage"".""The Government is serious about providing relief to victims and treating the injured,"" he added.In neighbouring India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of lives. ""India stands in solidarity with the people of Nepal and is ready to extend all possible assistance,"" he added.Nepal lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.

Prof-Himanshu-Rai-Director-IIM-Indore-Education-is-the-most-powerful-weapon-which-you-can-use-to-change-t,"Prof Himanshu Rai (Director, IIM Indore)“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”- Nelson MandelaIntroductionIn the tapestry of India’s progress, the past decade has been a vibrant thread, weaving a story of transformation in higher education. This era mirrors a metamorphosis, where educational institutions are not just temples of learning but crucibles of innovation, shaping minds and society alike. Amidst the global dance of change, India’s higher education sector has evolved, blossoming like a lotus in the sun, signifying not just growth in numbers but an awakening of potential, knitting the future with threads of knowledge, skill, and vision.As India gradually advances towards becoming the largest producer of human resources for the world, we reflect upon the strides made by India in the Higher Education scenario over the course of the last decade, as we anticipate the lines along which future developments may shape up.Dawn of a decade of Promise - The formative years (2013-14)The Indian higher education landscape in 2013-14 stood at a crucial juncture as it approached towards major transformation. While progress was evident, significant challenges re- mained in expanding access, ensuring quality, and fostering inclusivity.Access and enrollment were limited, with the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) at approximately 23% for the 18-23 age group, revealing stark regional disparities and socio-economic barriers. The institutional landscape, comprising 723 universities and 36,634 colleges, grappled with infrastructural constraints, especially in rural areas. Funding was another critical issue, with higher education receiving limited allocation from the total educational expenditure of 3.84% of GDP.While digital initiatives like MOOCs emerged (NPTEL being a major milestone), their reach was limited by uneven internet connectivity and infrastructural challenges. Online education, though showing promise, remained in its early stages, with the potential of full integration into mainstream learning experiences.Despite these challenges, 2013-14 also marked a period of introspection and reform. It served as a critical springboard for a future where Indian higher education would strive to bridge the access gap, enhance quality, and embrace transformative technologies.Building Momentum: Key Reforms and Initiatives (2014-23)The years since 2014 witnessed a concerted effort to propel Indian higher education onto a transformative trajectory. A wave of reforms and initiatives aimed at expanding access, enhancing quality, and embracing technological advancements reshaped the landscape.The establishment of new universities and colleges, particularly in underserved regions, led to a significant increase in the institutional network. This, coupled with targeted scholarship programs like SHREYAS scheme, Pradhan Mantri’s Ucchatar Shiksha Yojna, efforts to make student loans affordable through subsidies (strengthening the Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme 2009) and allocating credit guarantee funds (CCF Scheme 2015) etc., broadened access for marginalized communities and ignited aspirations across the nation.As per AISHE 2021-22, enrollment in higher education increased to 4.33 Crores in 2021-22 from 3.42 Crores in 2014-15. The GER increased from 23.7 in 2014-15 to 28.4 in 2021-22, with Female GER rising from 22.4 in 2014-15 to 28.5 in 2021-22. This expansion translated into millions more young adults entering higher education, with notable improvements in representation from previously underrepresented groups.The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emerged as a transformative road- map, emphasizing multidis-ciplinary learning, skill development, and industry partnerships. This paradigm shift aimed to equip graduates with relevant skills and foster employability in a rapidly evolving job market. Not only in terms of metrics, but the NEP, with its effort to radically redefine the education scenario in India, has ignited inspiration and uplifted spirits within the stakeholders in the sector.(To be contd)"

It serves as a communal space where individuals can broaden their horizons, explore new subjects, and engage in self-directed learning. Furthermore, a public library acts as a unifying force, fostering a sense of community and shared intellectual growth.The urgency for Government intervention is evident.(To be contd)"

And that's my thinking"", he said.In the same breath, he said, ""In politics, there is another slogan which is 'never say never'"".He was responding to a query on his remarks in a recent TV show in which he repeatedly said the 2024 Lok Sabha elections may mark his final contest from the Thiruvananthapuram constituency.""I didn't say never, I said I think it will be my last election,"" Tharoor clarified.The Congress leader said if he is going to contest the polls from Thiruvananthapuram, he would fight it as though it were his last election, in full spirits, doing his very best for the people.Tharoor, who entered politics over a decade ago, achieved a resounding victory in the 2009 general election, securing the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala and marking his debut in Parliament.In his first electoral battle, Tharoor triumphed over his closest CPI rival P Ramachandran Nair by a substantial margin of over 95,000 votes. Following this success, he maintained his hold on the seat with decisive victories in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Before beginning his political career, Tharoor worked with the United Nations, and in 2006 represented India as the official candidate for the position of UN Secretary-General, finishing in second place out of seven candidates in the race.

Beijing-Nov-13Chinese-experts-have-sounded-an-alert-about-the-relapse-of-COVID-19-infections-during-the-cur,"Beijing, Nov 13Chinese experts have sounded an alert about the relapse of COVID-19 infections during the current winter season and asked elderly and vulnerable populations to get vaccinated.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) shows that a total of 209 new severe COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths caused by COVID-19 were reported across the country in October, with the prevalent strains all being XBB variants, official media reported on Monday.China's top respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan warned of a small COVID-19 spike in the winter and reminded the elderly and vulnerable populations to get vaccinated as soon as possible, state-run Global Times reported.The virus is undergoing mutations, while the general population's ability to fight off the disease is declining because their antibody levels are lowering as time passes, Lu Hongzhou, head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, told the Daily.According to Lu, there may be a rise in COVID-19 cases during the winter seasons.Also, autumn and winter are known for high influenza rates, so people should also be cautious of potential co-infections, according to Lu.While it is still necessary to continue implementing prevention and control measures in the winter season, there is no need to be overly concerned about it, said Lu.The coronavirus which first emerged in Wuhan towards the end of 2019 had spiralled into a massive pandemic in which millions of people died all over the world while it affected the health of millions more.China steadfastly denied the allegations that the virus that shook the world was leaked from a bio-lab in Wuhan.While the world grappled with the fast-emerging variants of coronavirus, China disconnected itself from the rest of the world by banning or restricting flights from abroad.At home, China resorted to periodic shutdowns of various cities including Shanghai which severely affected its economy.As a result, the world's second-largest still remained in slowdown mode despite various efforts by the government to revive it.As the winter approached, apart from the risk of COVID-19 infection, there has been a high incidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) and influenza in recent weeks, the CDC said and cautioned about mixed infection of multiple respiratory pathogens until next spring, the Global Times report said.Press Trust of India"

MOSCOW-Dec-7-Russian-lawmakers-on-Thursday-set-the-date-of-the-country-s-2024-presidential-election-for-Mar,"MOSCOW, Dec 7 : Russian lawmakers on Thursday set the date of the country’s 2024 presidential election for March 17, moving Vladimir Putin a step closer to a fifth term in office.Members of the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of parliament, voted unanimously to approve a decree setting the date.“In essence, this decision marks the start of the election campaign,” said Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Federation Council. Russia’s central election commission is to hold a meeting on the presidential campaign on Friday.Putin, 71, hasn’t yet announced his intention to run again, but is widely expected to do so in the coming days now that the date has been set.Under constitutional reforms he orchestrated, he is eligible to seek two more six-year terms after his current one expires next year, potentially allowing him to remain in power until 2036.Having established tight control over Russia’s political system, Putin’s victory in the March election is all but assured. Prominent critics who could challenge him on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad, and most independent media have been banned.Neither the costly, drawn-out war in Ukraine, nor a failed rebellion last summer by mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appear to have affected his high approval ratings reported by independent pollsters.Who will challenge him on the ballot remains unclear. Imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an online statement Thursday urged his supporters to vote for anyone but Putin.“Putin views this election as a referendum on approval of his actions. A referendum on approval of the war. Let's disrupt his plans and make it happen so that no one on March 17 is interested in the rigged result, but that all of Russia saw and understood: the will of the majority is that Putin must leave,"" the statement said.Two people have announced plans to run: former lawmaker Boris Nadezhdin, who holds a seat on a municipal council in the Moscow region, and Yekaterina Duntsova, a journalist and lawyer from the Tver region north of Moscow, who once was a member of a local legislature.Allies of Igor Strelkov, a jailed hard-line nationalist who accused Putin of weakness and indecision in Ukraine, have cited his ambitions to run as well, but extremism charges levied against him by the Russian authorities render his candidacy unlikely.Strelkov, a retired security officer who led Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and was convicted of murder in the Netherlands for his role in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet that year, has criticized Putin as a “nonentity” and a “cowardly mediocrity.” He was arrested in July and has remained behind bars ever since. He is facing five years in prison if convicted.For Nadezhdin and Duntsova, getting on the ballot could be an uphill battle. Unless one of five political parties that have seats in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, nominates them as their candidate, they would have to gather tens of thousands of signatures across multiple regions.According to Russian election laws, candidates put forward by a party that is not represented in the State Duma or in at least a third of regional legislatures have to submit at least 100,000 signatures from 40 or more regions. Those running independently of any party would need a minimum of 300,000 signatures from 40 regions or more.Those requirements apply to Putin as well, who has used different tactics over the years. He ran as an independent in 2018 and his campaign gathered signatures. In 2012, he ran as a nominee of the Kremlin’s United Russia party, so there was no need to gather signatures.At least one party — A Just Russia, which has 27 seats in the 450-seat State Duma — is willing to nominate Putin as its candidate this year. Its leader, Sergei Mironov, a veteran lawmaker and a staunch supporter of Putin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Thursday that the party made the decision months ago and will nominate Putin at its party congress on Dec. 23, even if Putin decides to run as an independent.It wasn't immediately clear whether the Kremlin agreed to those plans. The party's press service told The Associated Press it was the party's initiative, and the Kremlin did not immediately comment.Running as an independent is more likely for Putin, said independent political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. “It will be too much honor for a party, he values himself highly. Therefore, I think he will run as an independent candidate, and will probably collect signatures. This will be a good pretext to promote the campaign in the regions.”Oreshkin, a professor at the Free University in Riga, Latvia, expects that Putin and several other significantly less popular candidates will be on the ballot, for example, longtime Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov or Nadezhdin.The central election commission plans online voting in addition to traditional paper ballots in about 30 Russian regions and is considering stretching the voting across three days -– a practice that was adopted during the pandemic and widely criticized by independent election monitors.Those measures on top of restrictions on monitoring adopted in recent years will severely limit the possibility of independent observers, according to Stanislav Adnreychuk, co-chair of Golos, a prominent independent election monitoring group.Andreychuk told The Associated Press that only registered candidates or state-backed advisory bodies, the Civic Chambers, can assign observers to polling stations, decreasing the likelihood of truly independent watchdogs. There is very little transparency with online voting, and if the balloting lasts for three days, it will be incredibly hard to cover nearly 100,000 polling stations in the country -– not to mention ensuring that ballots aren’t tampered with at night, he said.“Regular monitoring (at the polls) poses the biggest problem at this point,” Andreychuk said.“But we will be working in any case” he said of Golos’ plans, adding that they will conduct monitoring throughout the campaign and support activists who get to polling stations on election day.Analyst Oreshkin said the vote will be more of a ""ritual"" than a competitive electoral process.“This electoral ritual, electoral rite has a big significance for Putin and his team. It is important because it measures the loyalty of regional elites and (indicates) that the system works,” he said.AP"

It-is-early-days-yet-but-already-pundits-who-like-to-believe-that-they-belong-to-the-charmed-circle-who-have-a,"It is early days yet but already pundits who like to believe that they belong to the charmed circle who have access to the corridors of power and hence know what is going on behind closed doors, the educated  and conscientious younger and not so young lots who believe and are convinced that the elected representatives have unfailingly been letting down the people and Manipur for decades, the leikai experts whose claim to fame may lie in holding local durbars on the political developments eliciting rapt attention from some hangers on, have started talking about how the people should grow up to look beyond the freebies and actually elect someone who can present the case of Manipur and the people effectively on the platform where it matters. Welcome to Manipur and in line with one of the hot topics doing the round, the names of at least six personalities have started doing the round, never mind whether the persons named have shown any interest in throwing his or her hat in the electoral ring or not. Perhaps this is what makes the run up to any election here that more interesting and  adding to the uncertainty, such as which party will nominate who as their candidate,  are the numerous calculations doing the round. ‘With the reputation that Mr X has and the immense goodwill he has managed to garner down the years, he is sure to win provided he is nominated as the candidate of B party’ is a line that one is beginning to hear whenever any talk on the prospect of any likely candidate or political party is talked about. As noted at the opening line of this commentary, it is early days yet, and this could be a prominent reason why many seem to focus on the image of any of the names doing the round. Nothing new here, for this is what Manipur has been witnessing whenever election time comes, but if the past is any indication, ‘clean image’ as a defining criteria may just be given the royal boot once campaigning kicks up and money and clout begins to do the talking. The M factor, as understood in Money Power and Muscle Power, and there is a reason why M speaks louder and better than credentials such as honesty, sincerity, a clean image, the qualification of the candidate in question and the Manipur that one sees today reeks of the influence of M in every election the State has seen down the decades. This is 2024 and has any lesson been learnt from 2009, 2014 or 2019, just to go back to the last three Parliamentary elections or better still have the people learnt anything from the outcome of the 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022 Assembly elections ?  With so many ‘experts’ emerging the answer may best be left to them, but the question of greater importance is whether it is wise to let them answer this poser which directly affects ‘You and Me.’Given the current reality and the sense of  wrong it has brought about to Manipur, the Outer seat will be of immense interest and much will depend on how voters in the 8 Assembly Constituencies, including Jiribam AC, which fall within the understanding of the valley districts, cast their vote. As in the past, voters in the Outer Parliamentary Constituency will vote along the ethnic divide between the two major tribes, the Nagas and Kukis, and apart from the number of candidates from each tribe, what will prove to be the deciding factor will be the voters from the 8 Assembly Constituencies-Heirok, Wangjing Tentha, Khangabok, Wabagai, Kakching, Hiyanglam, Sugnu and Jirbam and the question is whether the Meiteis have it in them to vote wisely and be practical for once ? This is where the responsibility of each voter lies and knowing that responsibility will entail not much more than looking at the plight of the young children holed up at the different relief centres spread across the length and breadth of Manipur, recall the incidents of the past 10 months, in short a task which is not something hard at all, but the choice on voting day can say a lot about the future of Manipur. Time to know who can be friends and who are not. This is about the Outer Parliamentary Constituency and coming  to the Inner Parliamentary Constituency, the people should understand who is best placed to present Manipur in the correct perspective. Again not such a tall task for what is needed is to look back at the days gone by. Manipur needs to send the right people to the corridors of power. The moment should ideally belong to the people and it is in their power to decide which way Manipur proceeds. Amen."
Shobha-Shukla-Kalpana-Acharya-Contd-from-previous-issueVerbal-screening-for-TB-symptoms-is-not-enough-to,"Shobha Shukla, Kalpana AcharyaContd from previous issueVerbal screening for TB symptoms is not enough to find all TB in high burden settingsIn Nepal, the National TB prevalence survey 2018-2019 had found that over 70% of people with TB were asymptomatic – and would have been missed if X-ray was not used to screen them for presumptive TB (and was followed by molecular test to confirm TB disease). India’s National TB prevalence survey 2019-2021 had shown that almost half of the TB patients would have been missed if X-ray was not used as a screening tool.Bringing TB screening and testing facilities to the communities will be very beneficial–it will also reduce the cost people incur in traveling to big cities and reduce delay in diagnosis. “Mobile health clinics can go closer to the people and communities with TB screening, diagnosis and treatment services instead of centralized TB services in big cities waiting for the people to come to them. We should also add a component of TB screening and diagnosis in maternal and child healthcare services across Nepal,” hopes Binika.Public private partnerships could also help reach the unreached people and communities with full spectrum of TB services. Private healthcare providers must notify TB cases to the government so that we know the epidemic. We should also leverage the use of digital technologies.Affected communities must remain central to TB responses “I urge the Govt to include the people who have survived TB because they have the firsthand experience of it, they know where the problem or barrier is. We need to bridge the gap between ‘felt need’ and real need of the people,” said Binika Shrestha.It was long after finishing her TB treatment that Binika gathered courage to disclose her experience and to contribute actively towards ending TB. “It took immense courage for me to openly acknowledge my past battle with this disease. The journey from pain to strength has been a profound and transformative experience for me. I am determined to advocate for the inclusion of TB survivors' voices at the decision-making level.I firmly believe that their perspectives and experiences are invaluable in shaping policies and strategies to combat TB effec- tively. By working towards inclusiveness, I aspire to create a society where TB survivors are not only heard but also actively involved in shaping a healthier future for all.”(Shobha Shukla is the Managing Editor of CNS (Citizen News Service), Kalpana Acharya is Editor-in-Chief of Health TV Online Nepal, and both are Board members of Global AMR Media Alliance (GAMA) and Asia Pacific Media Alliance for Health and Development (APCAT Media).

Islamabad-Feb-10-Former-Pakistani-prime-ministers-and-bitter-rivals-Nawaz-Sharif-and-Imran-Khan-on-Friday-b,"Islamabad, Feb 10 : Former Pakistani prime ministers and bitter rivals Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan on Friday both declared victory in elections marred by delayed results and militant attacks, throwing the country into further political turmoil.Sharif's party won the most seats by a single party in Thursday's election, but supporters of imprisoned Khan, who ran as independents instead of as a single bloc after his party was barred from the polls, won the most seats overall.Sharif said his party would talk to other groups to form a coalition government as it had failed to win a clear majority on its own.Sharif's announcement came after more than three-quarters of the 265 seats had declared results, more than 24 hours after polling ended on Thursday when 28 people were killed in militant attacks.Analysts had predicted there may be no clear winner, adding to the woes of a country struggling to recover from an economic crisis while it grapples with rising militancy in a deeply polarised political environment.The results showed independents, most of them backed by Khan, had won the most seats - 98 of the 245 counted by 1830 GMT.Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) won 69 while the Pakistan People's Party of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated premier Benazir Bhutto, got 51.The rest were won by small parties and other independents.""Pakistan Muslim League is the single-largest party in the country today after the elections and it is our duty to bring this country out of the whirlpool,"" Sharif told a crowd of supporters gathered outside his home in the eastern city of Lahore.""Whoever has got the mandate, whether independents or parties, we respect the mandate they have got,"" he said. ""We invite them to sit with us and help this wounded nation get back on its feet.""Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party released an audio-visual message created using artificial intelligence and shared on his X social media account.In the message, which is usually delivered by word through his lawyers, Khan, 71, rejected Sharif's claim to victory, congratulated his supporters on ""winning"" the election and urged them to celebrate and protect their vote.""I trusted that you all would come out to vote - and you honoured that trust and your massive turnout has shocked everyone,"" the message said, adding no one would accept Sharif's claim because he had won fewer seats and because there had been rigging in the polls.Former cricket superstar Khan has been in jail since August, and was convicted three times in six days in the leadup to the polls for 10, 14 and seven years in cases related to state secrets, graft and an unlawful marriage.Sharif, 74, a three-time former premier, returned from four years of self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom late last year, having contested the last election from a jail cell on a graft conviction.He was considered the front-runner to lead the country, having buried a long-running feud with the powerful military.Sharif said his party would have preferred to win a majority of its own but in the absence of that would get in touch with others, including former President Asif Ali Zardari of PPP, to open negotiations as early as Friday night.In its first reaction, a senior aide of Khan said PTI leaders would hold talks among themselves and also meet Khan in jail on Saturday to discuss the results, Geo News reported.Results of the vote have been unusually delayed, which the caretaker government ascribed to the suspension of mobile phone services - a security measure ahead of the election.Independent members cannot form a government on their own under Pakistan's complex election system which also includes reserved seats that will be allotted to parties based on their winnings.But independents have the option to join any party after the elections.Challenges For Coalition""A timely announcement of the results, leading to a smooth formation of a new government, will reduce policy and political uncertainty,"" Moody's Investors Service said. ""This is crucial for the country that is facing very challenging macroeconomic conditions.""The delay in the announcement of results was unusual for Pakistan. Karachi's stock index and Pakistan's sovereign bonds fell because of the uncertainty.The main electoral battle had been expected to be between candidates backed by Khan, whose PTI won the last national election, and the PML-N. Khan believes the powerful military is behind a crackdown to hound his party out of existence, while analysts and opponents say Sharif is being backed by the generals.The military has dominated the nuclear-armed country either directly or indirectly in its 76 years of independence from Britain but for several years it has maintained it does not interfere in politics.Analysts say a coalition government will struggle to tackle multiple challenges - foremost being seeking a new bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the current arrangement expires in three weeks.A coalition government ""would probably be unstable, weak"" and ""the big loser ... will be the army"", said Marvin Weinbaum, Director of Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Middle East Institute in Washington.""Because the army really has staked its reputation on its ability to deliver this vote.""The election was expected to help resolve the crises Pakistan has been dealing with but a fractured verdict ""could very well be the basis for even deeper exposure to forces which would create instability"", he said.Reuters"

The recitation allowed the gathering to pay homage to the poets who have graced the world with their divine gifts of language leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of our collective consciousness."
Washington-Feb-7US-lawmakers-voted-Tuesday-to-reject-a-standalone-Israel-aid-bill-denounced-by-critics-as-a,"Washington, Feb 7US lawmakers voted Tuesday to reject a standalone Israel aid bill denounced by critics as a ""cynical"" bid to thwart a cross-party border security and foreign assistance package that would include cash for war-torn Ukraine.Republicans in the House of Representatives scheduled the vote after the Democratic-led Senate released a bipartisan bill Sunday pairing billions of dollars for Israel and Ukraine with some of the strictest immigration curbs in decades.But support for that $118 billion package has dwindled, with Donald Trump -- who is running for a second White House term -- pressuring Republicans to avoid handing President Joe Biden a legislative victory ahead of November's election.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the border and foreign aid bill was unveiled that it would be ""dead on arrival"" if it reached the lower chamber of Congress.The standalone Israel bill would have provided $17.6 billion in military aid for the country, which is strongly supported by the vast majority of lawmakers in both parties as it responds to the deadly October 7 attacks by Hamas militants.But 167 Democrats voted no after Biden had threatened to wield his veto, angered that the legislation appeared aimed at undermining the larger package, hammered out after months of negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators.The standalone bill was also opposed by 13 Republicans as it did not contain budgetary offsets that conservatives have been pushing for with every proposal for new spending.One of Johnson's first actions when he took office in the fall was to shepherd a bill through the House that would have provided $14.3 billion to Israel.But it included steep cuts to the Internal Revenue Service, which Biden opposed.The ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus blasted Johnson for ""surrendering"" to pressure for an even larger package which is not offset by cuts.Biden's Office of Management and Budget had said the Republican ""ploy"" would undermine efforts to secure the US border and support Ukraine against Russian aggression, while denying humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Hamas conflict.But Johnson countered at a news conference Tuesday that it was ""outrageous and shameful"" Biden would suggest vetoing support for Israel ""in their hour of greatest need.""House Democratic leaders called the bill a ""nakedly obvious and cynical attempt"" to undermine the larger package, which ties the Israel cash to $60 billion aid for Ukraine and $20 billion for US border security but is deadlocked in Congress.""Unfortunately, the standalone legislation introduced by House Republicans over the weekend, at the 11th hour without notice or consultation, is not being offered in good faith,"" House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a letter to colleagues.

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-21-The-Democratic-Students-Alliance-of-Manipur-DESAM-has-come-out-stro,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 21 : The Democratic Students' Alliance of Manipur (DESAM) has come out strongly against the recruitment notification of 1140 pre-primary teachers under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.Addressing a press conference at DESAM office at Kwakeithel, Mayengbam Somorjit, president, DESAM HO has laid down three key demands in this connection.The DESAM president has urged the State Government to set up National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) recognized pre-primary teacher training institutes and suspend the notification for the recruitment of 1140 pre-primary teachers until these centres are established.Secondly, he called for the dismissal/replacement of the Education Commissioner, Director and other officials concerned who offered their expertise and advice on the recruitment process.The Education Minister has also allegedly failed to launch the 4-year Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) in the State, as long demanded by DESAM, he said.During the press conference, the DESAM president also accused the Education Department of repeatedly modifying the recruitment rules of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan during the process to recruit 1140 pre-primary teachers as a means to gain public favour in light of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.As per the Right to Education Act 2009, teachers have to complete the necessary and required training to be eligible as ""educators"", he added.Stating that DESAM is firmly against the recruitment of 1140 pre-primary teachers which violates the recruitment guidelines, he maintained that one cannot be appointed as a teacher without the required pre-primary teachers' training.Pointing out the importance of pre-primary teacher training institutes under NCTE, he added that according to NEP 2020 pre-primary education extends for a period of five years and no such training institutes have been set up in the State."
NEW-DELHI-Jan-11-About-416-Myanmarese-soldiers-crossed-over-to-India-in-view-of-the-situation-arising-out-o,"NEW DELHI, Jan 11About 416 Myanmarese soldiers crossed over to India in view of the situation arising out of the fighting between Myanmar's armed ethnic groups and the Government forces, said Army Chief General Manoj Pande on Thursday, adding the Indian military is ""closely watching"" the unfolding developments. At a press conference ahead of the Army Day, General Pande described the situation near the Indo-Myanmar border as ""concerning"" and some of the insurgent groups are feeling the pressure in the frontier region of that country and are attempting to enter Manipur.""The situation across the Indo-Myanmar border is something that we are closely watching,"" he said.The officials said all 416 Myanmarese military personnel have already been repatriated.The anti-junta groups have reportedly taken control of several key towns, military bases near Myanmar's border with India and the volatile situation has forced scores of Myanmarese citizens to take refuge in Mizoram.""That (situation along the Indo-Myanmar border) has been of concern to us. You are aware of the activities of the Myanmar Army and the ethnic armed organisations and the PDF (People's Defence Forces) in the past couple of months,"" he said.The army chief said the situation has about 416 Myanmarese Army personnel crossing over to India till date besides some civilians from that country taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur.""The situation across the Indo-Myanmar border is of concern as we also have some of the insurgent groups, who are feeling the pressure and are now attempting to come to our side of the border in the State of Manipur,"" General Pande said.""That combined with the situation in Manipur is something we are keeping a close watch on,"" he added.The army chief said India is also considering strengthening fencing along the border with Myanmar.""We have strengthened our posture, deployment on the Indo-Myanmar border, we have close to 20 Assam Rifles battalions which are deployed there,"" he said.Myanmar has been witnessing wide-spread protests demanding restoration of democracy since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021.The Myanmarese military has been using airstrikes targeting its opponents and those carrying out armed struggle against the ruling regime.Myanmar is one of India's strategic neighbours and it shares a 1,640 kilometre-long border with a number of North Eastern States, including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur.The hostilities between Myanmar's anti-junta groups and the Government forces in several key towns and regions near the border with India fuelled concerns in the Indian military establishment about the possible spillover effect.Last month, India called for cessation of fighting between Myanmar's military and the anti-junta groups near the Indo-Myanmar border.PTI"

Sir-1-The-Sangai-Express-has-published-an-article-on-01-Nov-23-titled-The-Political-Conflict-Why-AR-is-he,"Sir,1. The Sangai Express has published an article on 01 Nov 23 titled ‘The Political Conflict: Why AR is here?’. The news article carried a statement that “Moreover, what did the Assam Rifles do ? Can a conclusion be drawn that they just sat back and looked at the unfolding scenario even as a police officer was shot dead and a reinforcement team was waylaid with such deadly precision”. The subject statement is unfounded, provocative and irresponsible.2. On perusing the article it clearly appears that the newspaper is trying to gain viewership by peddling a false narrative with a sensational heading, without bothering to check the facts. To set the record right, following facts are submitted:-(a) The incident of 01 October 23, wherein the brave heart Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Chingtham Anand lost his life is tragic. The incident took place in general area Eastern Ground near Moreh, where the police personnel were deployed co-located with a column of BSF personnel.(b) Further, on the same day when a column of State security forces with 29 vehicles moving from Chandel towards Moreh was attacked by armed miscreants in Senam (Tengnoupal District), the troops of the Assam Rifles rescued the three State Police personnel who had sustained gunshot wounds during the ambush. They were administered First Aid by Assam Rifles troops and thereafter, safely evacuated to the Assam Rifles Sector Hospital at Pallel where they received further care. Thereafter, the injured police personnel were safely evacuated to Raj Medicity, Imphal for immediate surgery by Assam Rifles troops.3. Apropos above, it is clear that the various security forces including the Assam Rifles are carrying out their duties with utmost sincerely and bravery, displaying exemplary joints- manship against the cowardly acts of the miscreants.4. The provocative and baseless reporting as exhibited in the article spreads misinformation and creates an additional front for the security forces to handle. It actually aids the miscreants and works against the efforts of the security forces who are trying to bring in peace and stability in the State.5. In the interest of responsible journalism, we encourage newspapers, including Sangai Express, to thoroughly investigate and verify the facts before publishing articles that may vitiate the environment and defame the Security Forces. Repeated instances of Yellow journalism may eventually erode the credibility of print media which is avoidable.Yours faithfully,Staff Officer(Public Relation & Media)IGAR (South)The Editor replies-In the first place, what the Assam Rifles is referring to here was not a news item, but a commentary, a commentary in the editorial column of this newspaper. Secondly the heading of the editorial is ‘Politics of conflict-Why is AR here.’The rebuttal here is off the mark by a long way. As the heading of the commentary asked, Why is the AR here ? the question is still left open on how the ambush on the police convoy was staged.It would not have been possible for some ‘village volunteers’ to have the expertise to pick a spot from where the ambush could be carried out so clinically. How did a marksman who could fire a sniper or a gunman take position and then open fire with so such clinical precision ?The assistance extended by the Assam Rifles to the injured policemen is acknowledged and noted, but this was beyond the ambit of the commentary. The thrust of the commentary was, how did the militants manage to pick the ambush spot and carry out the attack besides the fatal shot fired at the police officer ?To repeat, it was an opinion piece, it was not a news report."
Newmai-News-NetworkSENAPATI-Mar-19-The-United-Naga-Council-UNC-strongly-denounced-the-recent-incident-of,"Newmai News NetworkSENAPATI, Mar 19: The United Naga Council (UNC) strongly denounced the recent incident of the “belligerent provocation by the 6th Assam Rifles unleashing indiscriminate firing of live bullets upon the Naga civilians especially the Naga women folks” at Chingkao (Makuai) village, Tamenglong district on March 14.In a statement issued today, the UNC condemned the “heinous act” of the Assam Rifles “disrupting” the peaceful atmosphere in the area.“Such chilling campaigns of the Indian security forces under the patronization of the Government of India, waging undeclared war upon the Naga people have been going on for decades without ceasing under the draconian law of AFSPA, 1958”, the UNC alleged.Amid the prevailing tense situation in Manipur, UNC pointed out that 'roaming with arms and in camouflage-uniforms, killings, extortions and intimidations by both the warring communities right under the nose of the Indian security forces in the valley and in the villages of Kukis in the hill areas including highways have been continuing for ten months and as a matter of fact, relative peace can be only seen in the Naga villages in Manipur all this time'.In light of the above, UNC urged the Government of India to take necessary steps to stop “all these unwarranted provocations” once and for all.  It also demanded for initiation of befitting action against the “reckless officers” responsible for the occurrence of the said incident.Expressing strong resentment against such an ""intentional attempt of the Government and senseless sponsored violence"", All Naga Students’ Association, Manipur (ANSAM) in a separate statement urged that such apathy of Assam Rifles towards the Nagas should not be repeated in the near future.ANSAM also demanded that AFSPA should be repealed from Naga dominated areas."

There must be retribution.”AFP"

For those who don't know, Holi is the Indian festival of colours where people get together to smear each other with all sorts of pigments and celebrate the victory of good over evil. But have you ever wondered why Holi makes us feel so darn good ? Is it the colours ? The music ? The dance moves ? Or maybe just the fact that we get to pelt our friends with water balloons without getting in trouble ? In this blog, we'll be taking a critical and informative look at how the science behind Holi affects our mental health and why it's essential to use natural colours. So, put on your goggles, cover your hair with a scarf, and get ready to find out why Holi is more than just a colourful bliss.How HOLI affects our mood & mental healthHoli is a festival celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm and zeal. It is a time when people forget all their differences and come together to celebrate the victory of good over evil. This festival not only brings people closer but also has a significant impact on our mood and mental health. Let's take a look at how Holi affects our minds and why it is good for our mental well-being.1. Colours : The colours used during Holi have a profound impact on our mood. Colours are known to influence our emotions, and the bright and vibrant colours used during Holi can evoke positive emotions such as happiness, excitement, and enthusiasm. They also have a therapeutic effect (stimulating the release of dopamine) on our minds and help us feel rejuvenated and refreshed.2. Music: Music is an essential part of Holi celebrations. The beats and rhythm of the music can instantly lift our mood, making us feel happy and energetic. It also has a calming effect on our minds and can help us relax & de-stress.3. Social connections: Holi is a time when people come together to celebrate and have fun. The social connections we make during this festival can positively impact our mental health. It helps us build relationships and strengthen bonds with our friends and family, which can give us a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of loneliness as well as isolation.4. Playfulness: Holi is a festival that encourages playfulness and childlike behaviour. Playing with water & colours and indulging in fun activities can help us let go of our inhibitions and enjoy the moment. This playful attitude can affect our mental health positively and help us feel more carefree and relaxed.In addition to these scientific explanations, Holi also has a cultural significance. It celebrates the triumph of goodness, promoting unity and harmony among people of different backgrounds and beliefs. This cultural aspect of Holi can have a positive impact on our mental well-being by promoting a sense of community and connection.Benefits of using natural colourLet me paint you a picture, my friends. Imagine playing Holi with artificial colours that not only leave you with stains but also cause skin irritations and rashes. Now, imagine playing Holi with natural colours that not only give you vibrant hues but also have numerous benefits for your skin and hair. That sounds like a no-brainer, right ? Using natural colours in Holi is not just an eco-friendly choice, it's also a beneficial one. Natural colours are made from organic ingredients like flowers, herbs, and fruits, which have a soothing and nourishing effect on our skin and hair. They also have therapeutic properties that can help calm and relax our minds. So, not only will you have a blast playing Holi, but you'll also come out of it looking and feeling rejuvenated. Plus, you'll be doing your bit for the environment by opting for natural colours. So, let's embrace the natural side of Holi and colour the town red, green, yellow, and pink with natural colours!How to make plant-based natural coloursMaking plant-based natural colours for Holi is a fun and creative process, and it's super easy to do! Here's a quick guide on how to make your own natural colours:Green colour : Grind dried Gulmohur leaves, spinach leaves, or pine needles into a fine powder.Yellow colour: Mix turmeric powder or gram flour with water to form a paste. You can also use dried marigold or sunflower petals, which can be powdered and mixed with water.Red colour : Pomegranate, the bark of crab apple trees, and Red Sandalwood Powder can be used to extract out rich red colour. You can also use hibiscus flowers which can be ground into a fine powder and mixed with water.Saffron colour : Soak the flowers of the Tesu tree in water overnight. The resulting water will have a beautiful saffron colour.Blue colour : Soak indigo leaves in water overnight. Alternatively, you can use blue hibiscus flowers or jacaranda flowers, which can be ground into a fine powder and mixed with water.Purple colour: Boil beetroot in water until the colour is extracted. You can also use purple grapes or blueberries, which can be mashed and mixed with water.Brown colour: Mix dried tea leaves with water to form a paste. You can also use Katha, which is a natural plant extract that gives a brown colour.Different Holi colours in different bowls with spoonsDon't let toxic synthetic colours ruin your Holi fun! Herbal colours are scarce but worth the extra cost to protect your skin, hair, and health. Cheap synthetic colours contain lead oxide, diesel, and other harmful chemicals that cause rashes, allergies, and even acute skin diseases. Moreover, everyone else uses them too, so you're not avoiding the risks. So, go green and get creative with your natural plant-based colours this Holi, and have a blast!Pieces of advice to keep in mind!Alright, folks, listen up! It's that time of the year again when we go crazy with colours and drench each other with water. That's right, it's Holi time ! But before you dive headfirst into the festivities, let's go over some tips to ensure you have a safe and enjoyable Holi experience.First things first, put on some old clothes you don't mind getting ruined. Trust me, that Gucci shirt you've been eyeing is not Holi-proof.Next up, slather on some coconut oil or petroleum jelly all over your skin. It will make it harder for the colours to stick to your skin and will also help prevent skin irritation.Don't forget to wear some old shoes or flip-flops because the last thing you want is to ruin your new Nikes in a puddle of coloured water.Lastly, if you have long hair, tie it up in a bun or braid it to avoid a tangled mess. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can always go bald like Britney Spears.Bottom lineIn conclusion, Holi is more than just a festival of colours; it is a celebration of life and a time to connect with our inner child. The colours, music, social connections, and playfulness of this festival can have a significant impact on our mood and mental health. So, go ahead and embrace the festive spirit of Holi to experience the joy and positivity it brings.The writer is retired Principal and educational columnist"

More-than-9-months-Over-200-from-either-side-killed-Thousands-displaced-and-still-languishing-in-relief-cent,"More than 9 months. Over 200 from either side killed. Thousands displaced and still languishing in relief centres set up across the length and breadth of the State. Many others still missing. Hundreds of homes bull dozed and levelled to the ground. Other than this is the collateral damage that the Nagas, the only other group of people indigenous to the land, have had to suffer in the intense stand off. Other than appealing for peace and urging both sides to refrain from further violence, this was the first time that the United Naga Council (UNC) came out strongly against both Meiteis and Kukis for ‘targeting’ the Naga folks who have remained neutral so far. If the ‘selective targeting’ of Naga folks continues then it will not remain silent but chart out its own course of action, such as asking all Nagas settled in Imphal and the valley districts to pull out and go back to the hills and to put all Naga areas as off limits for the Kukis. Strong words indeed, but not without reason. To back up their stand, the UNC took the trouble of compiling all acts of ‘excesses’ against the Naga folks during the course of the violent clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis. The no nonsense statement from the UNC hit both sides equally and it started off by recalling the May 24 assault of four girls from Ukhrul by a mob at Imphal; the burning of a Liangmai Naga house at Leimakhong by Kukis; the shooting to death of a Maring Naga woman on July 16 at Sawombung; the assault of a Liangmai farmer by cadres of the Kuki Revolutionary Army on Imphal-Tamei road for refusing to pay illegal tax on September 5; the blatant life attempt, with guns, of Naga leaders by an individual who identified himself as a cadre of the Kuki National Army at Kangpokpi on September 27; assault of three Tangkhul Naga men by armed Meiteis at Sawombung on December 3; assault of two Rongmei girls at Bishnupur bazar on December 11; assault of one Naga driver from Tamenglong at Imphal; kidnapping of four Naga girls working in a beauty parlour at Imphal on December 18. These are but just examples of how the Naga people have been targeted  in the course of the clash between the two warring communities, according to the UNC and added that in all these cases, it has tried to defuse the tension.Neutral and cannot be part of the clash, but don’t push us too hard, is the loud message that one can read into the stand of the UNC. A point which Manipur should take note and acknowledge accordingly. This is certainly not the right time for Manipur or the Meiteis to rub any other party or community the wrong way. Destruction of Church was one point which the UNC pointed out in its statement to the media, but as a body representing a neutral community, in the ongoing clash, it would have sounded so much more sensible if it had taken the trouble to mention about the sacred places of the Meiteis which were also targeted and destroyed. The Ima Kondong Lairembi near Moreh is just one point that comes to mind. Moreover it should also not be forgotten that the Churches targeted and destroyed at Imphal and the valley districts were all Kuki Churches and not a single Church of the Naga community was targeted and attacked. The Manipur Baptist Convention Central Church continues to stand tall in all its Holiness and grandeur and plum opposite to that stands the Tangkhul Baptist Church. The Catholic Church at Mantripukhri continues to stand tall today too. Such points which could and should have been mentioned, if destruction of places of worship was to be mentioned, is what The Sangai Express feels. Whatever it is, it is significant to note that the largest body of the Nagas of Manipur has spoken and its stand should be noted and appreciated by everyone who believes in Manipur."
-Skill-mapping-website-launched,"IMPHAL, Jul 4 (DIPR): Labour & Employment Minister Dr Thokchom Radheshyam today launched a website www.mssd.in at his New Secretariat office cham-ber. He said that the website has been developed for online data collection of skills/work experiences of COVID – 19 returnees of the State.The skill mapping exercise would be conducted by Manipur Society for Skill Development (MSSD) under the Department of Labour & Employment. The launching of the website was attended by Additional Chief Secretary, Labour & Employ- ment Letkhogin Haokip; Additional Secretary, Labour & Employment, Th Chitra; Mission Director, Manipur Society for Skill Development Kh Diana Devi and officials concerned.The Minister said that it is a crucial time for the State as challenges are mounting due to COVID-19 pandemic. He stressed that the website would focus on skill mapping of citizens of Manipur who have returned to the State, after giving up their respective jobs, due to COVID-19 pandemic.He added that as per  available data, the returnees were earlier employed in different sectors such as restaurants/hotels, private companies, retail outlets, health care, salon/parlours, BPOs, airlines, private banks etc.He pointed out that the website would help in creating a database based on their skill sets and experience to tap and fulfil demand of private companies of the state and the country. He added that a Skill Data Proforma has been put up to be filled up by the returnees of the State so that the collected information can be shared with the concerned stakeholders such as State Government departments, empanelled training providers/ Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) facilitators etc.Dr Th Radheshyam also appealed to the COVID – 19 returnees to fill up the online skill data registration form by visiting the website www.mssd.in and register their skill data. He said that the collected skill data would also facilitate Government policy making through discussions with key stakeholders.He said that the department has been making every effort to address the challenges faced by the migrant workers and bridge the demand-supply gap. He further said that the Government is committed to pro- vide every possible support to COVID-19 returnees of the State and address the challenges they are facing due to loss of jobs.Mention may be made that a review meeting chair-ed by Th Radheshyam was held recently on June 24 to discuss feasible ways to fill up the labour gap in the State. He emphasized that a database needs to be created so that the skilled, semi skilled and unskilled returnees are identified.Replying to a query from media persons regarding the current scenario in education sector due to COVID – 19, Dr  Thokchom Radheshyam who is also the Minister of Education, said that the career of students cannot be compromised.He maintained that considerations are underway for relaxation of the required paper work/document in the transfer process of students to educational institutions of the State from other States. While appreciating the contributions of private school in the State, the Minister appealed private schools to furnish information sought by the Government.The Minister further stated that as per the Right to Education Act (RTE), no student upto VIII standard can be detained or failed whether examination is conducted or not but all students must be promoted.  He also appealed not to bind the young children of classes upto Standard V in the online classes as the devices are addictive and harmful to the minor children."
A-rose-by-any-other-name-will-still-remain-as-beautiful-as-it-is-but-it-may-not-be-as-all-encompassing-as-it-s,"A rose by any other name will still remain as beautiful as it is but it may not be as all encompassing as it sounds, especially when the politics of identity and ‘ancestral claims’ rears its ugly head. A Lily by its name may refer to any of the beautiful flower that blooms under the scientific name of the Lillium family and it is to give it its distinct identity that the Lily found growing at Shirui Kashong is known as Shirui Lily. Any attempt to change its name to say Mao Lily or Manipur Lily would be blasphemous to  the Tangkhul people, especially the people of Shirui village and it is this point which should be read into the passing of ‘The Manipur Names of Places Bill, 2024‘ in the Assembly on March 4, 2024. The pressing need to pass such a Bill should be acknowledged and appreciated and the Government will need to do more than just passing a Bill and enacting it, but be ready to take up swift and stern action if and when attempts to distort the name of a place is detected. This is all that more important when the name is closely associated with the identity and ancestral attachment of the indigenes to a place or a natural object. Going back into history, acknowledging the close ties of the indigenes to the land and jolting awake the people and the Government to the ‘politics of name’ may perhaps be said to be one of the positives that has emerged from the ongoing ethnic clash that has already claimed over 200 lives, razed, bulldozed and levelled to the ground numerous houses, rendered over 60,000 people homeless and forced them to survive in relief centres for over 9 months. It is obviously to blunt or neutralise the politics to lay claim of one’s identity or indigeneity over a place or locality that the State Assembly passed The Manipur Names of Places Bill, 2024 and one just has to go back to the month of August last year to understand the machination behind the  politics of stamping a name to claim one’s identity over a locality or a place. It was with a reason why the change of names of numerous localities in Moreh was brought to the notice of the world for here is a brazen act of cocking a snook at the understanding of the presence of a Government and so non-chalantly change the names of localities with a political motive. And so it was that displaced people of Moreh highlighted how Moreh Turel Wangma Leikai was found distorted as Chikim village, Moreh Khunou Leikai as T Yangnom, Moreh bazar Leikai as D Monaphai and Heinoumakhong Leikai as Chikim. Here is an example of the politics of names being orchestrated just so to wipe out the history of the Meiteis and other communities who had their homes at Moreh. And nothing can get more farcical and unacceptable than this.The politics of Thangjing to Thangting to Haokip Reserved Forest should take the cake, but there obviously is more. Kangpokpi to Kanggui, Churachandpur to Lamka, address of the ticketing office of Air India situated inside Bir Tikendrajit International Airport as Lamka are all examples that come to mind and which were spelt out in the Assembly on March 4.  A look across the different localities of Imphal should also leave no one in doubt of how names have been changed to give them a distinct ethnic stamp, a move which goes against the very cosmopolitan identity of the capital of Manipur and this is what would rankle many. Go back to before Manipur went up in flames in the evening of May 3, 2023, and one can still recall the attempts made to christen a place as Vaiphei Colony lying on the eastern side of Mantripukhri, a space acquired after some Meitei families sold off their paddy fields to meet some financial exigencies. Names may not mean much, but when one takes into account the politics behind the names being given to a place or the agenda of changing the name of a place to  give it an ethnic identity which goes against the history of the land, then it exceeds the understanding of just names. Manipur has woken up to the ugly reality rather late but it is significant that the conspiracy behind naming or renaming a place has been called out and perhaps the State Government may study the possibility of passing another Bill that seeks to revert the names of localities, especially in Imphal that have been changed sans the permission of the competent authority. Allowing localities to be named at the fancy and whim of any community should not be understood as being accommodative but crawling when asked to kneel, thanks to the Acts that have segregated Manipur as hills and valley."
Dr-Sanjeev-ChopraThe-last-three-Bharat-Ratnas-were-actually-a-tribute-to-the-entrepreneurial-spirit-of-the,"Dr Sanjeev ChopraThe last  three Bharat Ratnas  were actually a tribute to the entrepreneurial spirit of the Indian farmer. All  the  three–two former Prime Ministers Charan Singh and PV Narasimha Rao as well as Dr MS Swaminathan, the scientist administrator entrusted with the roll out of the Green Revolution–were deeply invested in  and personally committed to  agriculture as well as farmers welfare. Swaminathan’s contribution is quite well known and acknowledged, but it is equally important to understand  the context of the political economy in which the Green Revolution was successful.It was Charan Singh who explained to Nehru  the pitfalls of the Soviet and Chinese type of ‘collective farming’. He was clear that farmers were  fiercely independent cultivators  who did look up to the State for support in provisions for  public goods–water for the fields  as well as access to credit, roads and market infrastructure-but  were vehemently opposed to any centralized plan of ‘land pooling and co-operative farming’ which the then Planning Commission was enamoured of.It was during the tenure of PV Narasimha Rao that India joined the WTO, and signed the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) which made India’s agriculture globally competitive. Till then, India policy regime was to restrict imports : under Rao, India looked to Agri exports as an important foreign exchange earner. With budgetary and institutional support to APEDA, he helped the Indian agriculture to become globally competitive, though  domestic trade continued to be operate  through restrictive trade practices which were good for the procurement agencies and the registered traders of APMC, but not for the farmers.Moreover, while the traders were looking to the world as their market, the farmers were confined to the area marked for their respective market yard. But perhaps the most meaningful policy intervention made by him was the establishment of the SFAC in 1994, the organization which has now been tasked with the establishment of  the National electronic market for agriculture, thereby giving the farmer the ‘glocal advantage’ : a global market for local produce.All this provides the background and the context to a transformative initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi eight years ago on the first of Baisakh (14 April). The reference here is to  the SFAC backed Electronic National Agriculture market (E- NAM) initiative : ‘a phygital (physical plus digital) market’. This is a single window portal with  a physical back end which  provides actionable information, physical infrastructure, trade options and financial settlements.The information component provides notifications on  commodity arrivals, quality and prices. The  physical infrastructure includes market yards, storage godowns, weigh bridges, sortex machines, moisture testing equipment  and offers services like weighing, assaying and warehousing. For ease of doing business, it also   organises  the mandi arrivals into ‘offers for the sale and purchase of produce’ in terms of ‘specific  lots’ and ‘trade offers. The fourth component  includes the actual trade and electronic settlement of payments directly into farmers’ account. It is different from the speculative futures trading, because the settlement is taking place on a ‘here and now basis’ with physical deliveries taking place in the market yard accompanied by online settlement.Today, thanks to this initiative of the SFAC, 10.7 million farmers have the freedom, flexibility and the facility to transact across 1389 regulated wholesale markets in 23 States and 4 UTs in their own language on their own mobile phone. Another 1.7 lakh integrated licenses have been issued by the participating States and UTs, but of even greater significance is the active participation of 3500 FPOs–for their transactions reflect granular   support for this platform. As of January 2024, business of over Rs 3 lakh crore has been transacted on this platform.Before closing, it’s imperative to share the backstory of this successful intervention. It must be mentioned that when the APMCs were introduced in the fifties, the farmer needed protection against distress sale. This was before KCC became the ubiquitous instrument of rural credit, for in those  days, money lenders advanced loans to the farmers and compelled them to sell the produce at the farm gate itself. The APMCs were designed to ensure ‘price discovery’ and provide a platform for procurement by state agencies under the MSP regime.However, in this process, it also created a special class of intermediaries –the trader who had a license to operate in the particular mandi with its notified command area. However, as India became an IT superpower and agriculture moved from a peasant to a market mode of production, there was a need to change the restrictive rules of trade. Institutions like the SFAC were established to leverage technologies and financial instruments for improving the terms of trade of the marginal and small famers. From providing venture capital funds to agribusiness entrepreneurs to creation of infrastructure, the SFAC broke new ground in the establishment of FPOs, market intelligence, warehousing and procurement support.No wonder then, that the mandate for establishment of the ENAM was also given to the SFAC. To set the ball rolling, the Agriculture Ministry gave a grant of Rs 30 lakh per mandi for equipment/infrastructure such as computer hardware, internet facility, assaying equipment etc. in those regulated mandis, for installation of the e-market platform. This was enhanced to Rs 75 lakh from 2017 for creation of additional infrastructures like cleaning, grading and packaging facilities and bio composting unit. While in the first three years, about 200 Mandis were brought under its purview, the pace picked up  with 415 mandis by May 2020, another 260 mandis by July 2022,  yet another 101 mandis by March 2023 and 28 mandis the end of the last calendar year. The number grows every quarter !Policy making is the easy part. More difficult is the creation of the physical and IT infrastructure. The hardest is the task of making it work on the ground. For initial handholding,  SFAC identifies and supports an IT expert (mandi analyst) for initial hand holding for a period of one year to each mandi integrated with e-NAM. They report  to the State coordinator (s), each of whom handle the day-to-day coordination for  50 mandis each. They are also responsible for providing pro bono training to all stakeholders in the E NAM system-farmers, traders, commission agents and mandi officials.What next ? Rather than rest on its laurels, the E NAM is setting newer and higher standards. Its revised mandate incudes the expansion an and consolidation of the e-NAM  by opening platform beyond APMC/RMC mandis to create further and ensure competitive price realization to the farmers. There is increased emphasis on Warehouses Based Sale (WBS) and e-NWR trade through e-NAM.

IMPHAL-Mar-21-The-State-Forest-Department-observed-the-International-Day-of-Forest-at-the-Forest-Complex-Ma,"IMPHAL, Mar 21: The State Forest Department observed the International Day of Forest at the Forest Complex, Mantripukhri today.Notably, the United Nations General Assembly declared March 21 as the International Day of Forest in 2012 and this year’s theme is “Forest and Innovation: New Solutions for a Better World.”Speaking on the occasion as chief guest, Special Secretary (Forest) RK Amarjit said that the State’s forest cover declined from 78 per cent in 1987 to 74.34 per cent in 2021.According to the data provided by the Forest Survey of India, Manipur has lost more than 40 forest areas which were as large as Langol reserved forest between 1987 and 2021, he said.Disappearance of such large forest areas is a matter of grave concern and it demands immediate and effective intervention, he said.The Special Secretary (Forest) asserted that the primary message of the International Day of Forest is conservation of forests.“We would be doing a grave injustice to the future generations if we do not conserve forests”, he said.Amarjit pointed out that conservation of forests requires collective efforts of JFMC, local clubs, Meira Paibis and the public. Researchers and academicians too must contribute to these collective efforts, he added.Whatever forests that exist under different forest divisions of Manipur are now properly maintained and one major factor for this positive development is the involvement of local people in forest management, he said.People now have a strong sense to control and contain forest fires whenever such fires break out. There were instances of local people controlling and dousing forest fires even before the arrival of Forest staff, he said.Amarjit said that the incidents of forest fires are quite low this year.Stating that no one can survive without water, the Special Secretary (Forests) averred that conservation of forests and environment is an indispensable duty of every citizen.Deputy Conservator of Forest Siba Jeemy, DFO (Soil & Water Conservation Div II) Aneet Kaler, DFO (Soil & Water Conservation Div I) Kanthala Vijay Sahebrao,  DFO (Urban Forestry Div) M Wungrin Zamsing, DCF (Park & Sanctuary) Vikram Suresh Nadhe, DFO Kangpokpi Amandeep, DFO (Research) S Rebika, Associate Prof Dr N Sarita of Department of Environmental Science, DMU, Assistant Professor Dr Sadananda of Deen Dayal College of Forestry and Prof Vivek Baishman were also present at the International Day of Forest observation."

Agam-Dec-5The-death-count-from-a-volcano-eruption-in-Indonesia-has-risen-to-22-after-nine-more-bodies-were,"Agam, Dec 5The death count from a volcano eruption in Indonesia has risen to 22 after nine more bodies were discovered, a search and rescue agency official said Tuesday.Mount Marapi on the island of Sumatra spewed an ash tower 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) -- taller than the volcano itself -- into the sky on Sunday.Hundreds of rescuers have worked for days to find the missing hikers, which numbered 10 on Tuesday before the local rescue agency's announcement that most had been found, bringing the days-long search closer to an end.""Nine of 10 missing victims were found dead this afternoon and at the moment, they are being evacuated. There is one remaining victim currently in the search,"" Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency told AFP.The dead were carried down the mountain in bodybags over several days, rescue officials said.Images shared by Basarnas showed a rescue team of six in orange jackets and hard hats carrying a body down the side of the volcano on Tuesday.Some of the 75 hikers on the mountain during the eruption were found alive and carried down, with multiple suffering burns and fractures.One survivor spoke of his panic after the eruption began.""I was zig-zagging, going down around 30 to 40 metres"" to a trekking post, Ridho, 22, told AFP from a bed in a nearby hospital.""The eruption sounded loud, I took a look behind then immediately ran away as everyone did. Some jumped and fell. I took cover behind the rocks, there were no trees there.""The volcano was still erupting as of midday on Tuesday, according to officials, slowing the rescue efforts of more than 200 personnel.Later in the day, rainfall and volcanic smoke were still blocking a view of Marapi, according to an AFP journalist.'Mountain of Fire'Ahmad Rifandi, head of Marapi's monitoring post, told AFP Tuesday it had observed five eruptions from midnight to 8:00 am (0100 GMT).""Marapi is still very much active. We can't see the height of the column because it's covered by the cloud,"" he said.The head of Indonesia's volcanology agency, Hendra Gunawan, said Marapi has been at the second level of a four-tier alert system since 2011, and a three-kilometre exclusion zone had been imposed around its crater.He appeared to blame hikers on Monday for going too close to the crater, saying the agency recommended no human activities in that zone, and emphasised that ""severe impacts"" were reported for victims within one to 1.5 kilometres from the crater.Officials said the hikers had registered through an online booking system, but others may have been on illegal mountain routes.Those killed were severely burned and forensic workers were preparing to identify the dead by dental and fingerprint records, or based on marks on their bodies, said Eka Purnamasari, an official from the West Sumatra police medical unit.The search would last seven days until all of the hikers were found, rescue officials said.Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.Mount Marapi, which means ""Mountain of Fire"", is the most active volcano on Sumatra island and one of the archipelago's nearly 130 active volcanoes.Locals described the carnage when the volcano burst to life on Sunday.""The villagers were shocked because of the thundering noise, then there was a jolt and also a boom,"" said Adrizal, head of local village Nagari Lasi. ""The villagers were very traumatised by the eruption.""            AFP"
New-Delhi-Mar-2The-total-number-of-children-adolescents-and-adults-worldwide-living-with-obesity-has-surpa,"New Delhi, Mar 2The total number of children, adolescents and adults worldwide living with obesity has surpassed one billion, according to a global analysis published in The Lancet journal.These trends, together with the declining prevalence of people who are underweight since 1990, make obesity the most common form of malnutrition in most countries, the researchers said.The analysis of global data by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that among the world's children and adolescents, the rate of obesity in 2022 was four times the rate in 1990.Among adults, the obesity rate more than doubled in women and nearly tripled in men. In total, 159 million children and adolescents and 879 million adults were living with obesity in 2022, according to the study.Between 1990 and 2022, the proportion of the world's children and adolescents who were affected by underweight fell by around one-fifth in girls and more than one-third in boys. The proportion of the world's adults who were affected by being underweight more than halved over the same period..Obesity and underweight are both forms of malnutrition and are detrimental to people's health in many ways. The latest study provides a highly detailed picture of global trends in both forms of malnutrition over the last 33 years.""It is very concerning that the epidemic of obesity that was evident among adults in much of the world in 1990 is now mirrored in school-aged children and adolescents,"" said senior author Professor Majid Ezzati, from Imperial College London in the UK.""At the same time, hundreds of millions are still affected by undernutrition, particularly in some of the poorest parts of the world. To successfully tackle both forms of malnutrition it is vital we significantly improve the availability and affordability of healthy, nutritious foods,"" Ezzati said.The researchers analysed weight and height measurements from over 220 million people aged five years or older (63 million people aged five to 19 years, and 158 million aged 20 years or older), representing more than 190 countries.Over 1,500 researchers contributed to the study, which looked at body mass index (BMI) to understand how obesity and underweight have changed worldwide from 1990 to 2022.From 1990 to 2022, global obesity rates more than quadrupled in girls and boys, with increases seen in almost all countries, the study found.The proportion of underweight girls fell from 10.3 per cent in 1990 to 8.2 per cent in 2022, and for boys, it fell from 16.7 per cent to 10.8 per cent, the researchers said.Among girls, a decrease in the rates of underweight was detected in 44 countries, whilst among boys, a decrease was noted in 80 countries, they said.The total number of children and adolescents who were affected by obesity in 2022 was nearly 160 million (65 million girls and 94 million boys), compared to 31 million in 1990. Whereas 77 million girls and 108 million boys were underweight in 2022, decreasing from 81 million for girls and 138 million for boys in 1990.In adults, obesity rates more than doubled among women and nearly tripled in men between 1990 and 2022. The proportion of adults who were underweight halved between 1990 and 2022.In total, an estimated nearly 880 million adults were living with obesity in 2022 (504 million women and 374 million men), four and a half times the 195 million recorded in 1990 (128 million women and 67 million men), the researchers said.In all age groups, the combined burden of both forms of malnutrition increased in most countries between 1990 and 2022, driven by increasing obesity rates.However, the double burden of malnutrition declined in many countries in South and Southeast Asia, and in some countries in Africa for men, where the rate of underweight fell steeply.

Subhas-BhatacharjeeNorth-Eastern-States-are-small-and-are-in-the-developing-stage-which-have-a-long-way-to-g,"Subhas BhatacharjeeNorth Eastern States are small and are in the developing stage which have a long way to go in economic development and trade. Region contributes three per cent of India's gross domestic product. Barely one per cent of the region's agri-output is exported, with a lack of infrastructure for long-term storage. These States have factor endowments and skills which are quite amenable to trade and be further developed and promoted for the purpose of exports and create an international/ASEAN trade image of North East. While the prospects of NE-ASEAN trade are good, the problem to develop them is also quite formidable.Agribusiness and Food Processing has emerged as a high growth, high profit sector. The vast availability of natural raw material, favourable policy matters and numerous economic incentives & benefits offered by the Central Government have made India and even North East an attractive destination for investment in agro & food processing. Though the sector has huge potential, it is somehow unfortunate that it has remained relatively under developed, due to which enormous quantities of valued farm produces worth INR 95000 Cr are wasted annually.In order to arrest this colossal National loss, application of improved modern technology to develop integrated food supply chain from farm to the fork of the consumer is of utmost importance for both the North East and the country as a whole.NE region has a quantum of marketable surplus in a number of perishable commodities which are rated as immune boosters. Being the hub of organic and exotic agro-horticultural produces, spices & herbs North East offers basketfull of opportunities for the unusual. With its proximity to south East Asian markets, being home to diverse and exotic variety of fruits and spices, region can be major centre of agribusiness and can command a high price in domestic and export market. Many of these produces are having GI tags, thus triggering huge possibilities for branded marketing. Presently around 26 agro- horticultural products are having GI tag from North Eastern region.A dedicated marketing and visibility campaign with proper packaging and branding for products from North East needs to be implemented, which will help in increasing the awareness in target customer segments. These could range from large to small enterprises/start-ups or directly to customers. Further, the agricultural and horticultural produce value chains are marred by several challenges such as inadequacy of infrastructure, unavailability of processing industries, production and aggregation issues, etc.In the North East, large losses from farm to plate are mainly attributed to poor handling, distribution, storage, and proper packaging. Valued resources that could otherwise be spent on more productive activities go into producing and transporting goods that only go to waste for the want of appropriate primary or secondary processing/packaging. Losses at every stage of the food chain can be reduced by using appropriate processing and packaging. It is estimated that more than 40% of fresh produces are wasted due to various reasons in the region resulting in loss of nutritional value. Monetary loss on that count is also very high.Appropriate processing, packaging with proper branding, labelling and publicity can pave the way to a great extent. Training & skill development on packaging can facilitate the firstgeneration entrepreneurs of North East in making a dent in marketing of produces. Agro-horticulture potential of North East has not been tapped, mainly due to lack of market led production practices, poor commercial understanding of farmers, insufficient infrastructure at the farm level, poor transportation system, inadequate road network, pack houses, cold storages, sorting grading lines, processing industries etc.Time bound agro-horticultural projects (vocal for local) through entrepreneurs and its marketing/branding can truly transform this goldmine region into a vibrant hub of horticulture business and trade.Initiatives of Government of India to promote horticulture development, appropriate strategies like adoption of market driven production system, enhancement of productivity, appropriate post-harvest handling through proper packaging, loading/unloading of commodities and promotion of pack house concept including collection center in the production clusters, cold storage, processing and value addition, creation of adequate transportation infrastructure and organized marketing system are necessary additions to current interventions to provide remunerative prices to farmers.Fruit and vegetable processing industry offers enormous possibilities to be the mainstay of the economic development so as to directly benefit the farmers and prevent the wastage of the valuable farm produces, create enough direct and indirect employment opportunities for the rural youth.The emphasis of the Govt of India to introduce intensive cultivation of fruits and vegetables over higher land acreage and enhancing the productivity, with the proactive involvement of the agencies like Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and the Mission for Organic Value Chain Development for North East Region (MOVCD-NER), is going to bolster the sector. Processing, preservation and value addition of produces is going to generate additional income of the farmers as well as the FBOs (Food Business Operators) including the first-generation entrepreneurs and the intermediaries as well as the unemployed youth leading to the overall development. One can take advantage of this situation thereby supporting his/her own sustainability and also in turn support farmers/producers who otherwise are in a cornered situation due to unavailability of suitable and immediate food preservation systems.Influence of Natural & Organic foods of North East on consumption pattern across urban centre and elite groups are already in existence for long. Hence, most important is to reduce the post-harvest losses with their on-farm and near farm cluster processing solutions suitable for Farmer’s Producers Organisations (FPO), Farmers Producers Companies (FPC) and also large individual farmers of the North East.These sustainable processing and packaging can gear up domestic and export market further and bring a win-win-situation for farmers/producers as well as entrepreneurs of the region. Besides, a plethora of expertise under different Mission and Incubation Centre with innovative hand holding approach can utilise the naturally available resources of North East significantly.Considering the difficult terrain and the logistic issues, it is always preferred to set up facilities for value addition and processing in MSME sector. One can initiate and facilitate linking the up-coming units with established PAN India brands in the market to avoid initial stress of marketing of the products directly.Marketing through the established brands will support the processors in bringing up sustainability. However, there is an ample scope to self-sustain the sector considering the potential horticultural produces of North East States."

The WVA (World Veterinary Association)  will co-host the World Veterinary Day Award 2019 with HealthforAnimals, the global animal medicines association and the Award has increased to USD $ 2500.  All WVA Veterinary Associations, who may submit evidence that demonstrate their support of the value of   vaccination, can apply for the award.A biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease is called a vaccine. A vaccine typically contains suspension of weekend, killed, or fragmented microorganisms or toxins or of antibodies or lymphocytes that is administered primarily to prevent disease. The administration of vaccines is called vaccination.Veterinary vaccines are important for animal health, food production, animal welfare and public health. They are a cost-effective method to prevent animal disease, enhance efficiency of food production, and reduce or prevent transmission of zoonotic and foodborne infections to people.In this modern society, effective and safe animal vaccines are essential. Without vaccines for prevention of epizootics (an epidemic outbreak of disease in an animal population, often with the implication that it may extend to humans) in food-producing animals, it would be impossible to produce enough animal protein to feed the nearly 7 billion people on earth. Again, without companion animal vaccines, especially rabies vaccine many people would not keep a pet in the household and would not experience the satisfaction of the human animal bond. Zoonotic diseases (infectious diseases that can be naturally transmitted between animals and humans) such as brucellosis and leptospirosis would be much more prevalent without effective vaccines.New variants of existing pathogens and new diseases emerge every year, menacing human as well as animal health.   These new pathogens and diseases cause public and animal health issues and to solve these   issues, development of new vaccines is required.  Vaccines offer one of the best, long- term solutions for effective prevention of existing and emerging infectious animal diseases today and in the future.Both animal and human lives will be benefited from the continued progress in vaccine research and development. For this continued progress, a clear understanding of the benefits and risks associated with vaccines is needed amongst the regulatory authorities, researchers, industry, veterinarians, the media and the general public.Seventy five (75) per cent of all new human pathogens originate from animal sources and therefore vaccines are key to limiting the spread of infectious diseases from animals to people in future.Not only protecting companion animals and livestock against the infectious diseases, the vaccines ensure the provision of healthy and nutritious food such as eggs, milk and meat products. Without vaccination the picture of close association between people and their pets will be different. Vaccinations against the infectious diseases of food producing animals play a key role for efficient livestock production. Over 100 different veterinary vaccines are currently commercially available.EXAMPLES OF IMPACT OF VETERINARY VACCINESRinderpest disease is an acute, highly contagious, viral disease of cattle, domesticated buffalo and some species of wildlife. This disease is a classic example of how an animal disease can have a large public health impact.  Cattle infected with rinderpest were shipped to Africa in the year 1889 causing an epidemic that established the virus on the continent. Initially, approximately 90 per cent of the cattle died in the sub-Saharan Africa. Sheep, goat, wild buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest were also decimated. Draft animals, domestic livestock and wildlife were killed by the disease and that resulted in mass starvation, killing a third of the human population in Ethiopia and two-thirds of Maasai people of Tanzania. Thickets were formed in grasslands due to reduced number of grazing animals and these thickets served as breeding grounds for tsetse flies, the vector of trypanosomes, resulting in an outbreak of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) in humans. This epidemic of rinderpest disease is considered by some to have been the most catastrophic natural disaster ever to affect   Africa. The Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme is a large scale international collaboration involving vaccination, local and international trade restrictions, and surveillance. This international collaboration may be one of the veterinary medicine’s greatest achievements and riderpest may soon become only the second disease, after smallpox, to be globally eradicated.Rabies may be the oldest infectious disease known to man. Human rabies in developed countries have nearly eliminated due to vaccination of rabies vaccine in domestic animals and wildlife.  Every year, it kills as many as 60,000 people worldwide, i.e.   about 1 person dying of rabies every 9 minutes. Over 95 per cent of human rabies cases are caused by the bite of rabies infected dogs. Rabies in human can be eliminated by adequate animal vaccination, providing awareness to those at risk and appropriate medical care for those who are bitten.ROLES OF VETERINARY VACCINESAccording to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division world population was approximately 6.9 billion in 2010, and is estimated to increase to just to over 8.6 billion in 2030 and reach 9.8 billion in 2050.  High–Level Expert Forum of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported in October 2009 that in order to feed a projected world population, the overall food production will need to increase by 70 per cent between 2005/07 to 2050.  In meeting this need, vaccines that preserve animal health and improve production are important components.There is a major impact of vaccination for controlling zoonotic diseases in food animals, companion animals and wildlife on reducing the incidence of zoonotic diseases in people. It is unlikely that without rabies vaccines, families would be willing to keep cats and dogs as pets. Due to lack of available Brucella vaccines for animals, many countries have severe problems with Brucellosis in cattle, small ruminants, and people. However, vaccines of Brucellosis were instrumental in the eradication programme in the United States.Human and animal health faces a growing threat of emerging and exotic animal diseases and jeopardizes food security. Environmental degradation, globalized trade and travel and increase in human and animal populations, enhance opportunities for transfer of pathogens within and between species. Increased demand for animal protein has resulted in intensified commercial food animal production and/or expanded backyard production, which present unique challenges for disease emergence and control. Outbreak of emerging zoonotic diseases of both food and companion animals will be inevitable in the coming decades. For controlling emerging diseases, rapid development of animal vaccines will play a key role.With the extensive use of antibiotics in veterinary and human medicine, there is increasing concern related to antibiotic resistance. The need for antibiotics to treat infections in food producing and companion animals can be reduced by proper use of veterinary vaccines. Affordable and available vaccines reduce dependence on antibiotics for animal health.VACCINE PRODUCTIONThere is need of coordinated approach for animal and human infectious disease experts to prepare vaccines   for new and emerging diseases. Veterinary vaccines must be pure, safe, potent, effective and economical. For ensuring quality vaccine production for animal disease control, proper standards and production controls in the manufacture of veterinary vaccines are essential. Low and affordable cost of animal vaccines will encourage more use of vaccines and less use of antibiotics.CONCLUSIONLivestock and poultry play important roles in providing healthy and nutritious food and livelihoods to the farmers. New human and animal diseases will continue to emerge in future. To face the challenge, there is need for coordinated approach of the health, veterinary and public health communities at local and global levels. Readily accessible and economic production of veterinary vaccines will play a key role for protection of human and animal health, food safety and food security.To ensure access to critically important veterinary vaccines for current and future disease control needs, awareness campaigns about the recent trends of vaccines and vaccination are required.  Legislative support and conducive policy development will   help to stimulate public and private investment for vaccine production.  Availability of funding, continued investment and collaboration of different stakeholders will help in the development of new vaccines to face the emerging and challenging animal diseases.The writer is retired Deputy Director (Extension Education), Central Agricultural University, Lamphelpat, Imphal and can be reached at[email protected]"
PESHAWAR-Dec-12-At-least-23-people-were-killed-in-a-suicide-bombing-at-a-Pakistan-army-base-on-Tuesday-an,"PESHAWAR, Dec 12 : At least 23 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a Pakistan army base on Tuesday, an official said, in an attack claimed by militants affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban.The early-morning attack targeted a base in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghan border, according to a local official who spoke on condition of anonymity.""Many of them were killed while they were sleeping and in civilian clothes so we are still determining if they are all military personnel,"" the official added.An additional 27 people were wounded when the explosive-laden suicide vehicle detonated at a school building which had been commandeered as a makeshift military base, he said.Three rooms had collapsed and efforts were underway to pull bodies from the ruins, with fears the toll could rise further still, he added.Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan -- a new group affiliated with the Pakistan Taliban -- said the assault began around 2:30 am (2130 GMT) with a ""martyrdom attack"" by one fighter before others stormed the compound.Pakistan's army have not yet commented on the incident.Pakistan has witnessed a dramatic spike in militant attacks, mainly in its border regions with Afghanistan, since the Taliban returned to power there in 2021.Analysts say Islamist fighters have been emboldened by the neighbouring insurgency's success following the withdrawal of US forces in 2021.The first half of 2023 saw a nearly 80 percent spike in attacks compared to last year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.Islamabad alleges that hostile groups operate from ""sanctuaries"" across the border, a charge the Taliban government routinely denies.The biggest threat to Pakistan is its domestic chapter of the Taliban known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which shares lineage and ideology with Kabul's rulers.In January, the TTP was linked to a mosque bombing which killed more than 80 police officers inside a headquarters in the northwestern city of Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Islamabad said four troops were killed in September during a cross-border raid by ""hundreds"" of TTP fighters in Chitral, an area popular with domestic tourists.

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-20-Shija-Hospitals-and-Research-Institute-SHRI-has-completed-100-kidney,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 20 : Shija Hospitals and Research Institute (SHRI) has completed 100 kidney transplants.SHRI celebrated the milestone with an event  at its auditorium today where people living with transplanted kidneys, representatives of Mohan Foundation and All Manipur Kidney Transplant Association were present.Shija Kidney Care Card was also launched at the function.Speaking at the event, SHRI chairman cum managing director Dr Kh Palin said that 109 kidney transplants have been completed till date.He said that people with chronic kidney disease and a history of renal transplants can register for the Shija Kidney Care Card.Those with these cards would be given 20 per cent concession on laboratory investigations, 10 per cent discount on radiology investigations and procedures and up to 10 per cent discount on medicines.Even though dialysis is covered by CMHT and PMJAY, Erythropoietin is not covered by any of the two.Erythropoietin is an injection generally given to patients soon after undergoing kidney transplants.SHRI would provide this injection to kidney transplant patients free of cost with immediate effect, Dr Palin said.Medicines taken by people after undergoing kidney transplants must be taken for the whole life. SHRI would take up necessary measures to provide these medicines too free of cost, he said.Around two lakh chronic renal diseases are reported across India in a year but not all of them require kidney transplants. Many of them can survive with dialysis, he continued.Out of the two lakh cases, only around 12,000 undergo kidney transplants. A large number of patients who require kidney transplants cannot undergo the same medical procedure on account of various reasons,  unavailability of organ and limited number of donors being the main ones.When a person dies suddenly, eight organs are not dead. If these organs are donated, another person will survive, otherwise the living organs will either be cremated or buried along with the dead body, Dr Palin said.Now organ swapping has been permitted. This would certainly raise the number of kidney transplants, he said.JNIMS has also started performing kidney transplants and RIMS would also follow suit soon, he said.On the other hand, SHRI has been working hard to provide world-class health- care to the people of Mani-pur and beyond.The Governments of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have empanelled SHRI for treatment of their citizens at the hospital.SHRI has already performed more than 100 cornea transplants and it is working to start liver transplants, Dr Palin added."

Demand for a separate (hill) administration added fuel to the fire. Central security forces deployed and Union Home Minister (Amit Shah) came, saw and engaged in talks with the concerned authorities and people. But the guns and the empty stomachs continue rumbling.Call it ethnic conflict, but in reality, the votaries of a separate administration have struck a chord with insurgents pursuing a political objective.

Jenin-Jan-30Israeli-undercover-agents-some-disguised-as-medical-staff-raided-a-West-Bank-hospital-Tuesday,"Jenin, Jan 30Israeli undercover agents, some disguised as medical staff, raided a West Bank hospital Tuesday and shot dead three Palestinian militants, in the first such operation in eight years.An AFP photographer saw a bullet hole on a pillow covered in blood following the raid at Ibn Sina Hospital in the northern city of Jenin, where Palestinians gathered around the bodies of those killed.The Israeli military said forces entered the hospital -- a major health facility serving Jenin city and its adjacent refugee camp -- to target a ""Hamas terrorist cell"".Announcing the killing by Israeli forces of three people inside the hospital, the Palestinian health ministry stressed healthcare facilities are granted special protection under international law.""The minister of health calls urgently on the United Nations General Assembly, international institutions and human rights organisations to end the daily string of crimes committed by the occupation (Israel) against our people and health centres,"" a ministry statement said.The Palestinian foreign ministry said the ""heinous"" hospital killings were a ""crime against humanity"", in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.Closed-circuit television footage tweeted by the Palestinian ministry and said to be from the hospital shows armed men and women, disguised in medical uniforms or civilian clothes, moving through its corridors.The video shows the Israeli agents using a baby carrier and a wheelchair as props.Hospital director Naji Nazzal told AFP that ""a group of Israeli forces entered the facility undercover and assassinated the men"". They used weapons fitted with silencers, he said.Inside the hospital, the AFP photographer saw blood soaked into a mat and a chair, and spattered across a wall.The official Palestinian news agency Wafa named the three men as Muhammad Jalamnah, Muhammad Ayman Ghazawi and Basel Ayman Ghazawi.""The operation was carried out at the hospital's rehabilitation ward where Basel Ghazawi had been undergoing treatment,"" the hospital's director said.- Palestinians 'hiding' in hospital -The Ghazawi brothers were claimed as fighters by the Islamic Jihad militant group, while Hamas said Jalamnah was a ""commander"" in its armed wing.The Israeli army charged all three were ""terrorists"" who were hiding in the hospital.Jalamnah was involved in ""significant terrorist activity"" and was known for distributing weapons and ammunition for use in shootings, the army said.It said he had been ""inspired"" by the October 7 attacks by Hamas militants in Gaza, that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, in southern Israel, according to an AFP tally of official figures.He ""planned to carry out a terror attack in the immediate future and used the hospital as a hiding place and therefore was neutralised,"" the army said.Israel's relentless military offensive has killed at least 26,751 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.Weapons were placed on the bodies of the Ghazawi brothers as they were carried through the streets of Jenin in a funeral procession.Israel, which has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has stepped up its incursions into Palestinian towns ands cities since October 7.Jenin has been the focus of repeated Israeli raids, in which the army has demolished homes and ripped up streets as well as carrying out air strikes.While Palestinians frequently accuse Israeli troops of preventing paramedics from reaching those wounded in incursions, deadly raids inside hospitals are rare.The last one happened on November 12, 2015, when undercover agents pretending to bring in a pregnant woman raided a hospital in the southern West Bank city of Hebron.They detained a Palestinian accused of a stabbing and killed his cousin inside Al-Ahli Hospital.Since the October 7 attacks triggered war between Israel and Hamas, more than 370 people have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers in the West Bank, according to the health ministry in Ramallah.

Thuingaleng-Muivah-leader-of-India-s-oldest-rebel-organisation-has-told-Al-Jazeera-that-he-felt-the-Indian-,"Camp Hebron, Oct 7Thuingaleng Muivah, leader of India's oldest rebel organisation, has told Al Jazeera that he felt the Indian Government's abrupt decision to strip Kashmir's special status was ""unacceptable"".The 85-year-old leads the National Socialist Council of Nagalim - Isak Muivah (NSCN-IM) - North East India's largest rebel outfit with an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 members fighting for independence for more than four decades.NSCN-IM, formed in 1980, along with other armed groups based in Nagaland - a Christian-majority State - wants all Naga people unified in a new sovereign state called Nagalim.But the August 5 decision by the Indian Government to scrap Article 370 of the Constitution that granted Indian-administered Kashmira measure of autonomy has triggered anxieties across the North East region.""India's Kashmir decision [was taken] without respecting the history of the Kashmiris. [It] is not acceptable to us,"" he said.Expressing disappointment with the way the Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi diluted Kashmir's special status, Muivah said he feels ""nothing short of betrayal"" since India removed Kashmir's special status and brought its only Muslim-majority region under direct Central rule.Although India's hardline Home Minister Amit Shah has reassured regional leaders in the North East that Article 371 will not be scrapped, rebel groups fear that the current Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government may dilute these Constitutional provisions as part of its ""one Nation one Constitution"" vision.NSCN-IM, which signed a ceasefire deal in 1997, wants Nagalim to include all Naga-majority areas straddling across Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh States, as well as a part of western Myanmar across the border.In 2015, the rebel group led by Muivah signed a 16-point Framework Agreement with Prime Minister Modi and interlocutor RN Ravi but talks aimed at arriving at a political solution has dragged on.Muivah, who is based at Camp Hebron, the headquarters of the self-styled Government of the People's Republic of Nagalim, has expressed concerns at talks.Speaking from the camp spread across 81 hectares (200 acres) in Peren district of Nagaland, he said the Indian Government was backtracking on the question of Nagaland's sovereignty, a separate Constitution for the State and a flag for the Nagas.""Suddenly, they want the Nagas to come within the union of India. This came as a surprise to us,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Sorry, but that is not possible.""In 1980, the NSCN-IM broke away from the first armed group formed in the 1960s, the Naga National Council, after a group of leaders signed the Shillong Accord in 1975, accepting the Constitution of India, without condition.Prior to the accord, a group of leaders led by Muivah had fled to China where they were believed to have been trained by the People's Liberation Army.While no definitive figures are available, the armed rebellion has cost lives running up to thousands, including civilians and Indian armed forces personnel.Since the Framework Agreement was signed, speculations have been rife over the kind of Naga sovereignty being negotiated.'Divisions among rebel ranks'Alex Waterman, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, said that bilateral talks have suited New Delhi's interests.""This meant the [Naga] parties were divided and couldn't bring combined clout to the negotiating table,"" he told Al Jazeera referring to divisions among rebel ranks.""It also suited the NSCN-IM, as it has needed to be able to stake the claim that its peace process is the only legitimate one to fend off rival factions and consolidate its 'Government' in its areas of influence.""But now, Muivah alleges, the Government has gone back on its commitment.Despite repeated requests, Government Interlocutor and current Nagaland Governor RN Ravi declined to give a comment to Al Jazeera.On the face of it, NSCN-IM demand for an integrated Nagalim goes head to head with Modi's vision of ""one Nation one Constitution"".Soon after independence from Britain in 1947, India integrated about 500 provinces and princely States but some of them joined on the condition that they would be accorded special rights. Hence India's Constitution guaranteed limited autonomy to some North East States as well as disputed Kashmir region.Senior journalist Bharat Bhushan says the Modi Government is ""keen on forging India as a unitary State"".""Our federalism is asymmetric as there are special Constitutional provisions for different States. However, keen on forging India as a unitary State, the present political dispensation in Delhi seeks uniformity in dealing with all the States of the union in the same manner,"" he told Al Jazeera.Pro-India partiesThe Indian National Congress (INC) party, which dominated the politics of the state for decades, has been accused of dragging its feet on the issue.But K Therie, president of the Congress party in Nagaland, said that the party ""gave us full Statehood and protection under 371A"".""Now even separate flag and Constitution are ruled out. We fear that Article 371 will also be removed,"" he told Al Jazeera.But the current State Government, which runs in coalition with the BJP, has resolved to continue ""facilitating"" the peace process.Mhonlumo Kikon, a BJP member of Legislative Assembly and Advisor to the Government of Nagaland, said the Government is ensuring whatever legislative or public support needed for the solution.""We are in constant consultation with Naga civil society and all possible stakeholders,"" he told Al Jazeera.The Modi Government has set October 31 deadline to arrive at a solution but with many issues still remained to be ironed out, the possibility of a final deal looks remote.Seven other Naga groups, who are also part of the talks, are open to signing the deal, but NSCN-IM is adamant on a separate flag and Constitution.Experts fear that any accord signed without consensus may fail, such as the Shillong Accord.Oscar Fernandes, a former Minister in the Congress Government who was part of negotiations in the early 2000s, said that the talks would get stalled at the integration of so-called Naga contiguous areas within India.States of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are opposed to ceding their Naga areas to the future Nagalim State.""I can't comment on what the Government has in store for them. But I hope the solution comes once and for all,"" he told Al Jazeera.Muivah said he is confident that he can work it out with parties with apparently conflicting interests. True to their motto, he asks to repose faith in the Lord above all else.""Nagalim is for Christ, so we will not betray. If we betray, God will no longer be with us.""   Al Jazeera"
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-21-Even-though-election-notification-has-been-issued-for-both-Inner-Manipu,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 21: Even though election notification has been issued for both Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency and Outer Manipur Parliamentary Constituency, neither the ruling BJP nor the Opposition Congress has made any official announcement on their candidates.Except for CPI’s L Sotinkumar and NPF’s Kachui Timothy Zimik, no other party has officially announced its candidate for the two Lok Sabha seats of Manipur which would go to polls on April 19 and April 26.While L Sotinkumar would contest the election in Inner Manipur PC, Kachui Timothy Zimik would fight in the Outer Manipur PC.Nonetheless, sources informed that Indian National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may announce their candidates for both the Lok Sabha seats on Friday.Though no official announcement has been made as yet, INC is most likely to field Alfred Kangam Arthur in Outer Manipur PC as no other names were forwarded to the AICC by MPCC.Alfred Kangam Arthur has already started informal election rallies in Ukhrul.Although a number of aspiring candidates applied for INC ticket in Inner Manipur PC, JNU Delhi Associate Professor Bimol Akoijam is said to be the frontrunner for the INC ticket, said the sources.Even though the constituent parties of INDIA bloc favour a common candidate, there is no consensus on a common candidate within the alliance at least in Inner Manipur PC as CPI has already named Laishram Sotinkumar as its candidate.While INC and CPI are poised for friendly contest in Inner Manipur PC, there are reports of other alliance partners exerting strong pressure to field a common candidate, said the sources.However CPI has not said anything on whether it would withdraw its candidate or not. Whether CPI withdraws its candidate or not, INC is determined to field its candidate.Some Congress leaders, requesting anonymity, said that the party has already identified its candidates for both Inner Manipur PC and Outer Manipur PC although they are yet to be announced officially.Even though BJP Manipur Pradesh has already forwarded names of four aspiring candidates, the BJP Central election committee has not made any official announcement till date.It is not yet clear whether the BJP Central election committee would choose the party’s candidates from amongst the names forwarded by the State BJP or someone outside the list.Well placed sources informed that the potentials of two individuals are being studied minutely at Delhi. One of them is retired Lt General Konsam Himalay. The other is not a BJP member nor related to the party.Incidentally, the Chief Minister was also projected as a potential candidate in Inner Manipur PC by some quarters.The four individuals whose names were forwarded by the State BJP for party ticket included BJP Manipur Pradesh president A Sharda, Lok Sabha Member Dr RK Ranjan, Rajya Sabha Member Leishemba Sanajaoba and a key political figure.Although two names have been put in the spotlight for the party ticket in Inner Manipur PC, the BJP Central election committee has been deliberating intensively with regard to the Outer Manipur PC. There was even a proposal of supporting the NPF candidate instead of putting up any BJP candidate.Notably, BJP and NPF are partners of the ruling coalition, and the latter has already named Timothy Zimik as its candidate.BJP Central has also been studying another option of fielding a candidate from amongst the Zeliangrong community.Even though it is said that the Kuki-Zo communities have not been talking much about the Lok Sabha elections, the Kuki-Zo commu- nities have been working to field only one candidate.The sources however refused to divulge the name    of the proposed lone candidate of Kuki-Zo commu- nities. Nonetheless, it is being speculated that the pro- posed candidate may be one who fought the Lok Sabha elections earlier in Outer Manipur PC and served as the Manipur unit president of a National party.In view of the protracted violent conflict which erupted on May 3 last year, Kuki-Zo communities are not expecting votes from the Meitei voters of Assembly segments clubbed under Outer Manipur PC in favour of their candidates. As such, they have been planning to fight the Naga candidate(s) by fielding a lone candidate, the sources said.Earlier, well known Congress leader Dr Lamtinthang of Kangpokpi was projected as the lone candidate of Kuki-Zo communities but these days another man has taken his place.The man who is being speculated as the possible lone candidate of Kuki-Zo communities may fight the Lok Sabha election on Kuki People’s Alliance (KPA) ticket, the sources added."

Nonetheless, the Government has been planning to hold Cabinet meetings at hill district headquarters one after another, Biren said. On being asked about Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Imphal, the Chief Minister informed that the State Government has initiated necessary preparations following a verbal communication that he would land here on December 27 but it has not been officially confirmed."

Now NHIDCL has taken this mantle. NHIDCL outsourced the works to subcontractors and now it cannot control these subcontractors, he alleged, demanding NHIDCL to deal with the deteriorating conditions of other bridges while Barak and Makru bridges are being constructed.Questioning where else in the country, are such road and bridge conditions found except Manipur, Ranjit  demanded the General Manager or the Deputy General Manager of the firm to clarify all the questions at the earliest, instead of some unreliable statements made by a so called source or official of the firm.He then demanded NHIDCL to start work on the bridges and the road within 10 days to ensure that no trucks or vehicles are left stranded in light of the coming Ningol Chakkouba festival, and warned that if the firm fails to do so, TDC will be forced to impose a blockade along the route.Mocking NHIDCL's claims to convert the highway to a four lane highway, Ranjit demanded it to work on the single lane highway first.He also appealed to all other CSOs concerned and the people to monitor the work carried out by NHIDCL.If the firm wants to give up, then do so. TDC will take over the charge of repairing the road. TDC will also repair the wooden structures on the bridges. Any attempts to fool or dupe the people will not be taken lightly, he warned."

KHAN-YOUNIS-Jan-11-Bombed-out-neighbourhoods-mass-graves-dug-in-the-sand-spreading-hunger-and-disease-,"KHAN YOUNIS, Jan 11 : Bombed-out neighbourhoods, mass graves dug in the sand, spreading hunger and disease -- as the bloodiest ever Gaza war nears 100 days, besieged Palestinians have endured ever new horrors.More than three months of relentless Israeli bombardment since the October 7 Hamas attack have taken a gruelling toll on Gaza's 2.4 million people, most of whom have had to flee their homes.""It has felt like 100 years,"" said Abdul Aziz Saadat, who is among the flood of displaced Palestinians whose number the UN puts at 1.9 million, and who now lives in the densely crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.""Some are living in schools, some on the streets, on the floors, others are sleeping on benches,"" Saadat said in the city where many families now shelter in makeshift tents against the winter cold.""The war has not spared anyone.""Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, after its militants broke through a high-tech security barrier and launched the worst-ever attack on Israel.The bloody onslaught of October 7 left about 1,140 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, and saw 250 hostages dragged back into Gaza.Israel's relentless military response has caused massive destruction in the Gaza Strip, even by the grim standards of its four previous wars, fuelling anger across the Middle East and beyond.At least 23,357 people have been killed in the fighting, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas health ministry -- or almost one per cent of the population.The war will reach the 100-day mark on Sunday, with no end in sight.Many thousands of strikes have rained down on the long-blockaded and densely populated Mediterranean coastal strip, cratering crowded urban areas and pancaking multi-storey residential buildings.Much of northern Gaza has been reduced to a dusty wasteland and largely depopulated as Israeli troops and tanks have churned through it in a ground invasion from October 27 in which 186 soldiers have been killed.Gaza hospitals, schools, universities and places of worship have been hit, as Israel has argued Hamas fighters are hiding among civilians and in a vast tunnel network below civilian infrastructure.Entire neighbourhoods that once bustled with people, cars and donkey-drawn carts have been devastated in large-scale bombing starkly revealed in aerial photography.""It's just so widespread,"" said Jamon Van Den Hoek, an associate professor at Oregon State University who has been mapping the impact through satellite radar.""It's really unprecedented in the speed of the damage.""Between 45 and 56 percent of Gaza's buildings had been damaged or destroyed by January 5, according to research he has conducted with Corey Scher at the City University of New York.""The extent of damage that we've recovered or detected in Gaza only compares to the most severely hit areas in Ukraine,"" said Scher.The researchers said their figures may be higher than data from satellite imagery, as radar can pick up not just a bird's eye view but also damage to the sides of buildings.A United Nations Satellite Center assessment, which covered just the first 50 days of the war, found around 18 per cent of Gaza structures had already been destroyed or damaged.The war has also taken a toll on Gaza's ancient heritage, including centuries-old buildings in its historic centre, a web of narrow lanes which thrived with market traders and gold merchants before the war.UNESCO said it was ""gravely concerned"" and stressed that ""cultural property is civilian infrastructure, and as such must neither be targeted nor used for military purposes"".'Blood, chaos and mayhem'For now, the main battle for Gazans is just to survive.AFP journalists have seen mass graves dug in orchards, hospital yards and even a football field.Corpses retrieved from collapsed buildings have been transported by bulldozers and piled up in hospital morgues.Gazans have spoken of being unable to retrieve decomposing bodies from the streets for fear of being killed themselves.Hospitals are places of ""blood on the floor, chaos and mayhem"", said Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization's representative for the Palestinian territories.Surgeons have operated without anaesthetic and by the light of smartphones.Of Gaza's 36 hospitals, only 15 are still partially functioning, the latest UN figures show. Some have been raided by Israeli forces.The outlook is bleak for patients, among them around 60,000 war-wounded.""I've never witnessed so many amputations in my life among adults, among children,"" said Peeperkorn.'People are starving'Most of the homeless are crowded around Rafah in the far south as the main battlefront, now around Khan Yunis, moves ever closer.Sanitary conditions are dire and people scramble for food brought in by occasional aid trucks from Egypt.""We lost hope,"" said one of the displaced, Ibrahim Saadat. ""We shower just once a month... diseases have spread everywhere.""The UN children's agency reported 71,000 diarrhoea cases in a single week in December.Most farming and fishing has stopped, bakeries have run out of fuel, and shop shelves are bare.The World Food Programme's regional director Corinne Fleischer said ""I've never seen such a massive food gap"" and that ""people are already starving"".Hamas has shown no sign of surrendering, more than 130 hostages remain inside Gaza, and Israel has warned the war could rage on for many more months.Outside a tent in Rafah, Hadeel Shehata, 23, lamented the fate of Gazan children who haven't been to school for months.""It was all for nothing -- everything is lost,"" Shehata said.""We lost all of our dreams.""AFP"
N-Munal-MeiteiInternational-Day-of-Action-for-Rivers-is-observed-on-March-14-every-year-since-1997-This-day,"N Munal MeiteiInternational Day of Action for Rivers is observed on March 14 every year since 1997. This day is for the life of people, animal, the river and the water itself. The day aims to draw attention to the threats faced by the rivers, such as pollution, encroachment, damming, economic, climate change and cultural and recreational values. Rivers create lives and enrich ecosystem with freshwater for drinking and irrigation. Rivers are not only the key to restoring and maintaining the Earth’s highest biological diversity but also the zone of intense human activities.The river system of Manipur may be divided into, Imphal River valley covering 28.4%, Barak valley for 40.5% and Eastern catchment drain to Chindwin covering for 31.1%. As per land use data, total  river system in the State covers 6332 sq km which is 28% but the water bodies of the State stretch only 1.65% of the geographical area. The main water source of our rain-fed State is, the rivers. But our rivers are very alarming because of the dried up springs and water holes. Rampant deforestation, shifting cultivation and large scale poppy plantation are some of the counted causes.Seasonal inundation of floodplains and wetlands supports groundwater recharge which depend on healthy river flows. But the water table of the State have been lowered from 2-4 m and 4-5 m respectively for valley and hills which is also alarming. Ithai barrage has become a symbols of destruction to the natural ecosystem of the State.Nowadays, freshwater ecosystems are the most degraded on the earth’s surface because of excessive construction, encroachment and dumping of industrial sewage into rivers. Globally, more than two million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the rivers every day which is equivalent to the total weight of the entire 7.2 billion human population. So to save rivers is for the humanity and planet. The river pollution are impacting the communities that depend on rivers for their survival.Rivers are not just some scenic views of the water, they are the lifeline of the world. The theme for this year is, “Water for All”, which demands that the rivers be declared National assets. It also includes the legal right to stop the rivers from getting into dumping sites of waste and plastics. Whether we are tackling water rights, clean water access, fighting against dams, water grabs and water privatization, we know water is life and is meant for all.Rivers are the centre for life and they connect the land and oceans for a continuous water cycle. All ancient civilizations grew up near the rivers as the land next to rivers are very fertile for growing crops. Rivers are valued place for sporting, fishing, bathing, spiritual, religious and recreational purposes. Rivers produce 15% of global power generation.One threat to rivers is the rising water temperature due to climate change. River temperature not only regulates the physical, chemical and biological processes in the aquatic lives but also impacts the ecosystems, human health and other uses of water. The extensive use of rivers over many centuries has also taken a toll on rivers from various environmental factors.In India rivers are venerated, but pollution is a major issue. The Union Jal Shakti Ministry, is dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of wetlands and river basins. The National Green Tribunal has already requested the Union Jal Shakti Ministry to devise a strategy for cleaning up the country’s contaminated river segments.Rivers are also a part of our communities. A river is much more than the flowing water but its bed and banks, the groundwater below, its surrounding forests, marshes and floodplain are all parts of the river life. Every river is unique in terms of its flow, landscape, the species it supports and on its associated ecosystems.Rivers have no political boundaries; they connect Nations with different languages, culture and religions as a loving mother. Thus rivers are part of global peace and integrity. Rivers are also the most beautiful objects seen from the outer space.A river’s flow is its heartbeat. Naturally high and low water levels create habitat conditions essential for reproduction and growth for many species. Flood pulses move sediment that form an integral part of our environment and they are vital for people and wildlife.Healthy rivers are the lifelines of our planet. Rivers and their watersheds – and the rich variety of life they sustain –provide people with water, food, medicines, building materials, land-replenishing silts and more. They mitigate floods and droughts, support forests, sustain fisheries and provide byways for travel. Protecting our rivers is therefore the health insurance for all.The rivers are also the living entities. Now rivers in every country face an array of threats. Only our active involvement will ensure their health in the years ahead.We all win when rivers are allowed to flow freely. Therefore, on coming of International Day of Action for Rivers, let’s ensure that everyone is aware of the importance of river and save our rivers.The writer is an environmentalist and can be reached at[email protected]"

The unique history of the Nagas, means–Naga identity, culture and territory are also unique. Naga territories have never been ceded to any power nor conquered, he maintained."

Sir-1-Article-titled-WMC-decries-published-in-Sangai-express-on-02-Nov-23-brought-out-statements-of-the,"Sir,1. Article titled ‘WMC decries’ published in Sangai express on 02 Nov 23 brought out statements of the organization ‘WMC’ unjustifiably accusing the Assam Rifles.2. Upon reading the statements of the subject organization which has come in the wake of the recent incidents at Moreh, it can be assessed that the subject organization is totally unaware of the ground realities and the role of Assam Rifles in upholding the rule of law and working towards the restoration of peace in a non-partisan manner.3. Firstly, wherein the WMC has stated Assam Rifles to be mute spectators with regard to the incident in both the above mentioned articles,  to set the records right, the following facts are brought out :(a) The brave heart Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Chingtham Anand lost his life at the location Eastern ground near Moreh on 01 Oct 23, where the Manipur State police personnel were deployed co-located alongwith with a column of BSF personnel.(b) Further, on the same day when a column of State security forces with 29 vehicles moving from Chandel towards Moreh was attacked by armed miscreants in Senam (Tengnoupal District), the troops of the Assam Rifles carried out a daring rescue in face of firing by the miscreants. The three State police personnel who had sustained gunshot wounds during the ambush were administered immediate First Aid by Assam Rifles troops and thereafter, were safely evacuated to the Assam Rifles Sector Hospital at Pallel where they received further expert care. Thereafter, the injured police personnel were safely evacuated by Assam Rifles troops to Raj Medicity, Im-phal for immediate surgery.(c) Presently, Assam Rifles columns have been assisting the State police at Moreh in apprehending the unlawful elements.4. Secondly, in the article published in ‘The Sangai Express’ the subject organization (WMC) has accused Assam Rifles of bias. With regard to this it is brought out that the Assam Rifles has taken action against rioters in an unpartisan manner and doesn’t look for ethnicity while dealing with rioters.5. Thirdly, the subject organization has accused the Assam Rifles of attack on the State, which is inappropriately defamatory and raises a question on the motive of the subject organization to make such false accusations.  Such baseless accusations not only defame the reputation of the armed forces but also disrespect the sacrifices made by the men and women in uniform.6. It is highlighted that such misinformation as above, which spreads disaffection and is prejudicial to National integration is prima facie violative of Constitutional provisions. Further, the statement which purposely accuses Assam Rifles of bias, promotes enmity between communities is prejudicial to maintenance of harmony being sought to be achieved in the current situation and amounts to bringing hatred/ excite disaffection towards the Assam Rifles, an agency of the Government.7. Apropos above, it is brought out that as a responsible and impartial news source, it is crucial to exercise caution when sharing content that can poten- tially damage the reputation of the law enforcement agencies and has far reaching repercussion on the smooth conduct of rescue and security operation in the State. Proliferation of such malicious and baseless figments not only deepens divisions but also distracts from the pressing need to address the crisis collectively under the wide ambit of the democratic setup of the Nation.8. Thus, in the interest of responsible journalism, we encourage the media, to thoroughly investigate and verify the facts before publishing defamatory and false statements that may shape public opinion and perception.Yours faithfully,Staff Officer (Public Relation & Media) IGAR (South)"

It is expected to open Tuesday to the public.""The extraordinary moment of the consecration of Shri Ram Lalla's life in Ayodhya Dham is going to leave everyone emotional. It is my great pleasure to be a part of this divine programme. Hail Siya Ram!"" he tweeted earlier.He performed a series of rituals at the Temple, with the ‘pran pratishtha’ taking place during the 84-second 'Abhijeet muhurta'. At the end of the rituals, the PM prostrated himself before the idol, which depicts the child Ram.The ceremony took place in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.Outside, Ayodhya resident Anil Singh called it a “priceless moment” that he would treasure forever. “As a resident of Ayodhya, I feel proud that I live in this spiritual city,” he said.Leaving the sanctum sanctorum, the PM moved to another location to address a gathering of about 8,000, which included seers, people linked to Ram Janmabhoomi movement and celebrities from fields like entertainment, sports and industry.He also visited Kuber Tila shrine and interacted with workers who built the temple.The PM ended his 11-day fast he undertook ahead of the ceremony by accepting “charnamrit” offered by temple trust treasurer Govind Dev Giri.Senior BJP leaders including party chief JP Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah watched the live streaming of the consecration ceremony.The run-up to the consecration ceremony, which takes place just months before the Lok Sabha elections, was marked by sparring between the ruling BJP and the Opposition.Top Opposition leaders skipped the temple inauguration, calling it an RSS-BJP event. But Himachal Pradesh Minister Vikramaditya Singh, who is the son of State Congress chief Pratibha Singh, arrived at the venue.Several States had declared the day a holiday to allow people to watch the ceremony on TV and also take part in events at neighbourhood Temples.The new idol depicts Ram at the age of five, and was carved from black stone by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj.It was draped in a yellow dhoti, and adorned with stone-studded jewellery and flowers in shades of red, yellow and purple.Fifty traditional musical instruments from across the country were part of a devotional ""mangal dhwani"" that resonated during the ceremony. Orchestrated by Ayodhya's celebrated poet Yatindra Mishra, the rendition was supported by New Delhi’s Sangeet Natak Akademi.The instruments included pakhawaj, flute and dholak from Uttar Pradesh, veena from Karnataka, algoja from Punjab, sundari from Maharashtra, mardala from Odisha, santoor from Madhya Pradesh, pung from Manipur, nagada and kali from Assam and tambura from Chhattisgarh.Devotees arrived from several parts of the country to the Temple town to be part of the occasion, though they could not attend the main ceremony.Ceremonial gates depicting 'Jai Shri Ram' in floral patterns and illumination visible at night added to the aura of the ancient city which has undergone a massive infrastructural growth in the last couple of years, after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on the Temple-Mosque dispute.The 16th century Babri Mosque, which many Hindus believe was constructed on the site of Lord Ram’s birthplace, was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992.After a long legal battle, the top Court ruled in favour of the construction of the Temple. It also ordered allotment of a five-acre plot for building a Mosque.The invitees who arrived early Monday in Ayodhya included Anupam Kher, Kailash Kher, Jubin Nautiyal, Prassoon Joshi, Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Ravishankar Prasad and Anil Ambani.Hema Malini, Kangana Ranaut, Sri Sri Ravishankar, Morari Bapu, Rajnikanth, Madhur Bhandarkar, Subhash Ghai and Sonu Nigam had reached Sunday.'Ramdhun' played in the streets from early morning, as security personnel kept a tight vigil across the Ayodhya districts.The invitees were presented with a 'Ram patka' and welcomed with 'tilak'. All invitees were presented with a bell which they rang during the `aarti’.The Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir has been constructed in the traditional Nagara style. Its east-west length is 380 feet, width 250 feet and height 161 feet. It is supported by 392 pillars and has 44 doors.The pillars and walls of the Temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities.The consecration rituals began from the Saryu river banks on January 16 and were completed Monday afternoon.Temples across the country had announced special festivities. From Washington DC and Paris to Sydney, events were planned in various parts of the world as well by the Vishva Hindu Parishad, or the Hindu Diaspora.PTI"
New-Delhi-Feb-11-The-government-is-examining-foreign-direct-investment-from-China-in-Paytm-Payments-Service,"New Delhi, Feb 11 : The government is examining foreign direct investment from China in Paytm Payments Services Ltd (PPSL), the payment aggregator subsidiary of One97 Communications Ltd, sources said.In November 2020, PPSL had applied for licence with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to operate as a payment aggregator under the guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways.However, in November 2022, RBI rejected PPSL’s application and asked the company to resubmit it, so as to comply with Press Note 3 under FDI rules.One97 Communications Ltd (OCL) has investment from Chinese firm Ant Group Co.Subsequently, the company filed the required application on December 14, 2022 with Government of India for past downward investment from OCL into the company in order to comply with Press Note 3 prescribed under FDI guidelines.An inter-ministerial committee is examining investments from China in PPSL and decision would be taken on the FDI issue after due consideration and comprehensive examination, sources said.Under Press Note 3, the government had made its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments in any sector from countries that share land border with India to curb opportunistic takeovers of domestic firms following the COVID-19 pandemic.Countries which share land borders with India are China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Afghanistan.A query sent to OCL for comments remained unanswered till the filing of the story.The Reserve Bank last month barred Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL), an associate company of OCL, from accepting deposits or top-ups in any customer account, prepaid instruments, wallets, and FASTags, among others after February 29, 2024.The Reserve Bank’s action against PPBL follows a comprehensive system audit report and subsequent compliance validation report of external auditors.RBI had said that these reports revealed persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns in PPBL, warranting further supervisory action.On March 11, 2022, RBI had barred PPBL from onboarding new customers with immediate effect.PTI"

Naypyidaw-Feb-11The-Government-in-Myanmar-has-announced-compulsory-military-service-for-all-young-men-and-w,"Naypyidaw, Feb 11The Government in Myanmar has announced compulsory military service for all young men and women as the country's turmoil continues.The army seized power from the civilian Government in a coup in February 2021.But in recent months it has been defeated in a series of battles with ethnic militias and anti-coup fighters.The move announced on Saturday will require all men aged 18-35, and women aged 18-27, to serve at least two years under military command.No further details have been released. But in a statement, the junta said its Defence Ministry would ""release necessary bylaws, procedures, announcements, orders, notifications and instructions"".The military has faced a series of humiliating defeats in recent months.At the end of last year, three ethnic insurgent armies in Shan State-supported by other armed groups that oppose the Government-captured border crossings and roads carrying most of the overland trade with China.Last month, the Arakan Army (AA) said it had taken control of Paletwa in Chin State and the last military post in Paletwa township, the hilltop base at Meewa.The military-installed President of Myanmar, Myint Swe-a former General-has previously warned the country is in danger of breaking apart if the Government could not bring fighting under control.A law allowing conscription was introduced in Myanmar in 2010, but has not been not enforced until now.Under the legislation, the terms of service can be extended up to a period of five years during a state of emergency. Those ignoring summons to serve can instead be jailed for the same period.A state of emergency was announced by the country's junta in 2021 and was recently extended for a further six months.Myanmar had endured almost 50 years of rule under oppressive military regimes before the move towards democracy in 2011.On 1 February 2021, the military announced it had taken control of the country.Disorders and fighting have affected the country ever since, with more than one million people being displaced and thousands killed.The performance of the army in its recent battles with ethnic armed groups - some of which have ended in defeats and retreats - has sparked criticisms and doubts among its supporters.BBC"

IMPHAL-Oct-6-CAF-PD-and-Revenue-Minister-Karam-Shyam-today-distributed-his-MLA-Local-Area-Develop-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 6: CAF&PD and Revenue Minister Karam Shyam today distributed his MLA Local Area Develop-ment Fund (MLADF) to beneficiary committees of 16 polling stations at a function held today at Chajing Mairenkhong community hall.Speaking at the gathering, Karam Shyam stated that it is of paramount importance for every politician to keep their words and not to betray people’s trust.It is also crucial for a politician to execute all public works in a transparent manner and ensure that all the people get their due shares and opportunities, Shyam said.“Guided by this conviction, I’m distributing the MLADF to people in front of media”, he said.Recalling that he was elected to the Manipur Legislative Assembly for the first time from Langthabal AC in 2012, the lone LJP legislator also remembered that assurances he gave to the people of Langthabal AC in the run up to the election.He went on to claim that he has been translating all the assurances into action one by one and PDS items are being distributed to beneficiaries without wasting a single kilogram.“MLADF is also being distributed to the people through beneficiary committees and I have been helping needy people at my best level”, he claimed.MLADF for 2017-18 and 2018-2019 was Rs two crore each. For the current financial year, Rs one crore has been sanctioned.Out of this Rs one crore, Rs 75 lakh has been distributed to 11 polling stations. Moreover, five polling stations which were left out from distribution of MLADF  in the past have also been given their due shares today, Shyam said.MLADF was utilised properly in the past although there were a few complaints, he said.He then appealed to all the beneficiary committees to utilise the MLADF distributed today properly and in constructive manner.He further appealed to all concerned to ensure that  there is no sore feeling among the people over utilisation of MLADF.Referring to media reports about distribution of underweight LPG refills and refilling of fuel below the volume purchased, Karam Shyam said that he has demanded a detailed report from IOCL.Earlier, Shyam inaugurated four waiting sheds built at Langthabal Khoupum under MLADF."
This-is-not-the-time-to-take-political-dividends-out-of-the-crisis-besetting-Manipur-for-the-last-9-months-yet,"This is not the time to take political dividends out of the crisis besetting Manipur for the last 9 months yet at the same time it should also be questioned how closely is the BJP led Government working with all MLAs, irrespective of their political affiliations to take Manipur on the path of normalcy. This is a question which only Chief Minister N Biren and his men can answer but the significance of this poser is significant, especially given the finger of accusation pointed by Congress MLA K Ranjit on February 11. Sugnu Assembly Constituency was probably among the last Constituencies to be hit by the violence, save for the Naga dominated districts, and this is where it becomes important to question whether   ‘violence was allowed’ to envelop this Constituency due to the indifference of the Government. Rewind to the early days of the conflict, that is the days before May 28 of 2023 and one can still remember the all community meeting held at the initiative of the said MLA and how violence engulfed Sugnu on May 28 and not before. This means Sugnu remained somewhat an island of peace and normalcy till May 27, that is a full 24 days after violence erupted at Torbung, Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Moreh and which soon spread to Imphal and the valley districts, particularly at the fringe areas where Meiteis and the Kukis used to live cheek by jowl. Sugnu definitely fulfils after the understanding of a place where Meiteis, Kukis and people of other communities live together and it was in keeping this reality this in mind that MLA K Ranjit organised a meeting of community leaders before violence hit the place on May 28. From May 3 to May 27, Sugnu remained free of the mayhem witnessed in other parts of the State, save for the Naga dominated districts, and if one goes by what the MLA has had to say then the Government could and should have done something on the ground to keep the situation under check. This is where the importance of taking everyone along becomes important and hence the question on whether the Chief Minister has tried to reach out to all MLAs, irrespective of the political party they belong to. As noted at the opening line of this commentary, this is not the time to take political mileage out of the conflict and this is certainly not the time to mark out people’s representatives on the basis of the political party they belong to. Manipur and her people are central to it all and any inputs or suggestions to serve the interests of the place and her people should be welcomed. More importantly the Chief Minister needs to show that his office and his mind are open to suggestions, irrespective of from where it has come.How many times have all political parties meeting been organised after Manipur went up in flames in the evening of May 3, 2023 ? This is not just a run of the mill question, but a point which should be studied and considered with the merit it deserves. As representatives of the people, aren’t all the MLAs equally important to discuss what steps should be taken up to deal with the situation ? Has the Government ever given a thought on reaching out to the community which has remained neutral all this while-the Nagas and see what role they may play to bring the two feuding parties to the negotiating table ? Or is the Government under the impression that a solution can be brought about sans dialogue ? All questions at the moment for which no answer is also expected, but something should be done and the first and most important step should be to take all political parties, all elected members and representatives of all communities, particularly the community which has remained neutral all this while, into confidence. Tell, ‘look Manipur needs you. The people need your suggestions and inputs. The Government is ready to listen to every suggestions offered’. This is one step that ought to have been taken up long back, but so far there is nothing to indicate that the Government has done anything to reach out to every section of the population and this is saying something a lot. The silence of the Prime Minister is loud and it says so many things and the silence is the vacuum which the State Government should rise and try to fill up. The doors of the Government should always be kept open for any suggestions and inputs and it is important that everyone is taken along. Not the time for petty politicking. Now is the time to bat for Manipur and her people."
WASHINGTON-Feb-19Abraham-Lincoln-pardoned-Joe-Biden-s-great-great-grandfather-after-a-late-night-Civil-War-,"WASHINGTON, Feb 19Abraham Lincoln pardoned Joe Biden's great-great-grandfather after a late-night Civil War-era brawl, documents reportedly show, linking the two US presidents across the centuries.The court martial records in the US National Archives, reported on by the Washington Post Monday, detail the trial of Moses J Robinette after a fight with fellow Union Army civilian employee John J.Alexander on March 21, 1864.Robinette was charged with attempted murder after the tussle in the Army of the Potomac's winter camp in Virginia, when Alexander overheard him saying something about him to a cook, and rushed at him.The two men scuffled, and Robinette drew his pocketknife, leaving Alexander with several cuts before others intervened, according to the documents.The 42-year-old, who had been hired by the army as a veterinary surgeon, insisted that Alexander ""possibly might have injured me seriously had I not resorted to the means I did.""But military judges convicted him and sentenced him to two years' hard labor.Three army officers petitioned Abraham Lincoln to overturn his conviction, claiming the sentence was unduly harsh and that Robinette had been defending himself against someone ""much his superior in strength and size.""Abraham Lincoln agreed, and signed the pardon on September 1 that same year.The story ""has waited 160 years to be told,"" according to the Washington Post article, written by historian David J. Gerleman.The ""slender sheaf of 22 well-preserved pages of his trial transcript, unobtrusively squeezed among many hundreds of other routine court-martial cases in the National Archives, reveals the hidden link between the two men -- and between two presidents across the centuries,"" Gerleman wrote.""Those few pages not only fill in an unknown piece of Biden family history, but also serve as a reminder of just how many Civil War stories have yet to be told.""

It-may-be-a-little-premature-to-say-that-the-guns-being-fired-from-Dongyang-and-Lailophai-in-Churachandpur-dis,"It may be a little premature to say that the guns being fired from Dongyang and Lailophai in Churachandpur district towards Sugnu have fallen silent permanently but it is significant to note that there were no reports of gun fire on February 20, that is after 6 consecutive days of Sugnu being pummelled since February 14.  The silence stretches on to the next day, for till the time this commentary is being penned down on February 21, there is no report of any fresh offensive being launched at Sugnu. One the day the guns fell silent, The Sangai Express carried the news of search operations being carried out at Sugnu, Dongyang and Lailophai and it is no co-incidence that the silence came along with the massive search operations being conducted at the said three places. A co- incidence it is but the massive search operations came just one day after The Sangai Express had questioned why security forces were not being mobilised to neutralise the guns that were fired towards Sugnu from Dongyang and Lailophai for six days on the row and along with the search operations came the silence of the guns. This is significant and in a way the sense of being vindicated is overwhelming. As reported, a combined team of State police,  Central Reserved Police Force (CRPF) and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) launched massive search operations at Dongyang and Lailophai while a combined team of 136 Bn of the Border Security Force and Kakching police did the same at Sugnu. This development should give solid credence to the poser raised in this column on why the security personnel were not activated to neutralise the gun toting elements who have been raining bullets at Sugnu from the said two places at Churachandpur. This is where the observation of Sugnu Assembly Constituency MLA K Ranjit that the series of violence could have been contained if only the security personnel had been pressed into service to neutralise the militants who launched the attacks on Sugnu, is insightful. Fortunately no one died during the six days of continuous assault on Sugnu, save for the injuries inflicted on two BSF personnel, including a Head Constable and two village volunteers. This is apart from the heavy damages caused to houses and human settlements at Sugnu.Maybe it is in taking a leaf out of the Sugnu experience that report was received of State force personnel being deployed at some sensitive and vulnerable areas which have seen repeated attacks from Kuki militants. As reported, well trained State force personnel have been deployed at the foothills of Andro Assembly Constituency adjoining Kangpokpi district while teams of 6th Indian Reserve Batallion and 6th Manipur Rifles have been stationed at Nongpok Keithelmanbi, Laikhong, Itham, Tumukhong and Maphou Dam. Steps which are expected from the State Government and one hopes the Centre is also apprised of the need to goad the Central security forces, especially the Assam Rifles, to be on the alert and nullify any attempt to launch offensives from the hills. It is time to make sense of the deployment of over 60,000 Central security personnel, personnel who were rushed here after Manipur went up in flames in the evening of May 3, 2023. Already over 9 months since violence broke out and the involvement of SoO cadres in the series of attacks launched on the Meitei settlements at the foothills, at Moreh and at other sensitive places should be more than clear and it is for this very reason why  demands have been raised to abrogate the SoO pact. It is already the 22nd of February  and the time frame of the SoO pact is set to expire by the end of this month and it is for this very reason why Manipur is watching with trepiditations on what steps New Delhi will take up. Or should Delhi expect Manipur to be satisfied with just the decision to do away with the Free Movement Regime and the announcement that the Indo-Myanmar border would be fenced ? Or is the coming Lok Sabha elections going to be used as the perfect alibi to keep matters at bay and avoid taking any critical decisions ? Imphal should gear up to present a water tight case before Delhi as and when the time comes."

Newmai-News-NetworkDIMAPUR-Feb-17-NSCN-IM-has-accused-Kuki-militants-KNA-B-of-killing-one-Honpam-Chithun,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Feb 17: NSCN-IM has accused Kuki militants, KNA(B) of killing one Honpam Chithung on February 10, 2024 in Myan-mar. In this regard, NSCN-IM said “repeated messages given to the Kuki-Zo people should not be treated in a casual manner”.NSCN-IM then said, “Needless to say, this particular incident is something that has played into the nerves of National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) and GPRN as the people’s ‘government’ has taken strong exception against the KNA(B) and the Kuki villages in the border like Ma- wailuk, Aishi, Phaikoh etc”.This kind of senseless warmongering has been recorded as an affront to the dignity and manhood of the Nagas, NSCN-IM asserted.In a statement made available to Newmai News Network this evening, NSCN-IM said that notwithstanding many provocative incidents, Nagas have maintained cool to stay stead- fastly neutral in the ethnic conflict between the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zo in Manipur ever since the “bloody pogrom” started on May 3, 2023.The NSCN-IM statement then said, “Exercising our faith in God we have extended the hands of huma- nity in the true spirit of Christianity towards the displaced Kuki-Zo people who have fled from the war-torn Myanmar and taken shelter in Naga areas in Kamjong and other places in Ukhrul district after fleeing from Imphal valley”.However, things seem to have gone wrong in the hands of the Kuki militants, notably KNA-B with their “insane warmongering”, NSCN-IM also stated.The statement then accused that, for reasons best known to KNA(B) militants, they killed one Honpam Chithung on February 10, 2024 in Myanmar. But what has evoked strong response from the Nagas in general and NSCN in particular is why Honpam Chithung was killed, NSCN-IM also said.“Was the killing related to being Tangkhul?” it asked.NSCN-IM then said it is a matter of regret that when the Tangkhul civil society organisations went to the place at Phaikoh to get the mortal remains of Honpam Chithung, no cooperation was forthcoming from the Phaikoh headman and his villagers.“We cannot rule out the involvement of Assam Rifles based at Phaikoh to collaborate with KNA(B) in killing Honpam Chithung,” NSCN-IM added.The NSCN-IM statement said repeated messages given to the Kuki-Zo people should not be treated in a casual manner.“That the Nagas wish to coexist peacefully with the Kuki-Zo but without compromising the Nagas’ geopolitical right should be acted upon with open heart respecting the Nagas’ traditional right over the land”, it added."
SHILLONG-Mar-21Ansumana-Kromah-scored-the-all-important-goal-to-give-NEROCA-FC-a-crucial-1-0-win-against-TR,"SHILLONG, Mar 21Ansumana Kromah scored the all-important goal to give NEROCA FC a crucial 1-0 win against TRAU FC in an I-League match at the SSA Stadium in Shillong on Thursday, March 21, 2024. Kromah’s strike also helped NEROCA return to winning ways. The last time NEROCA had won a match was back in November last year, when they edged past Delhi FC 4-3.The win helped NEROCA leapfrog TRAU to 12th in the league. While both teams are on 10 points from 19 matches, the former are ahead on the head-to-head record.Understanding the significance of the match, both for morale and positioning in the league, NEROCA approached the game with a clear intent to seize control and capitalise on their chances.NEROCA goalkeeper Soram Poirei was alert to the dangers in the early exchanges and pulled off a good save to keep Danish Aribam out in the 24th minute.The very next minute, NEROCA’s Darius Snorton Perwood found himself in a similar position, and took a shot at the TRAU goal that Aaryan Anjaneya saved.The first half’s best chance went to TRAU when Deepak Singh floated a cross from the left flank. An unmarked Issahak Nuhu Seidu connected with the ball sweetly but his shot hit the woodwork.The second half panned out similarly before NEROCA’s David Simbo hit the crosspiece with a powerful long-distance strike in the 70th minute.NEROCA’s persistence finally paid off when Ansumana Kromah scored in the 79th minute. Adama Coulibaly exchanged passes with Kromah before setting up the Liberian forward with a cross from the right. Kromah didn’t make any mistake as he volleyed home a crucial goal that fetched the points for his side. AIFF Media Team"

The impacts of hiking import duty on betel nuts from 4 per cent to 40 per cent as per a decision of the Government of India since January 2017 were also discussed at length.It was also pointed out that import duty imposed on betel nuts imported to Sri Lanka has been slashed from 40 per cent to 6 per cent.Many of the delegates pointed out that the cross border trade would not bring any economic growth until and unless a free trade regime is introduced as done in neighbouring South Asian countries.They urged the Minister to initiate certain measures in this regard and also to ensure growth of border trade.Th Biswajit noted that Myanmar has been enjoying lion’s share of the profits earned from the border trade while the Indian side is unable to reap any significant benefit out of it.He claimed that the State Government has been considering the matter with all seriousness apart from working hard to introduce a number of policies and programmes which would promote local entrepreneurs.Informing that the Government of India was approached several times in the past to take up necessary measure to ensure growth of Indo-Myanmar border trade, Biswajit noted Manipur is now dependent on Myanmar even for mango and tree bean (yongchak).Now people have started importing fish from Myanmar in addition to Andhra Pradesh, he said.He then appealed to all the people of Manipur to cultivate a healthy work culture in order to multiply the volumes of local products and give up the tendency of dependency on imported goods.After the incumbent Government was sworn in, industrial estate of Kuraopokpi and Tera Urak which was lying idle has been re-activated and the industrial estate has started producing a number of goods. Even repairing of electric transformers is now done at the industrial estate.Now many entrepreneurs have been asking the Government to allot them worksheds inside the industrial estate, he said.Biswajit also proposed the delegates of Border Trade Chamber of Commerce to collectively take the issue of Indo-Myanmar border trade issue to the Government of India’s Commerce and Industries Ministry.Highlighting that it is essential to open a visa facility at the Moreh integrated check post, Biswajit asserted that it is also crucial to enhance banking infrastructure  and open forex full fledged money changer and export-import financial transaction facilities at Moreh.He also invited written suggestions from entrepreneurs on the border trade."

But it is being planned for completion by December, the Minister added.Pointing out that road blocks were set up for installing the super structure, Biswajit explained that the work had to be done during the daytime as the structures needed proper alignment and apologised to the people for the brief inconvenience caused due to the road block.It may be mentioned that the three foot bridges are being constructed under the work proposal 'Road safety works through improvement of junctions, footpath, road signage and marking and construction of foot bridge', submitted by PWD Manipur to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The total costs of the project is around Rs 18.47 crore out of which around Rs 2.40 crore is for the foot bridges.The construction works are being handled by Bengaluru based Sanjay Infra Pvt Ltd.The foundation of the foot bridge which will connect the footpath of Kangla and the one near Johnstone Higher Secondary School, was laid in January this year.Today, steel tubulars assembled at Pune were brought and installed for the two superstructure.The two meter broad foot bridge will be covered with a tensile membrane.The two other foot bridges will also be constructed in a similar manner.On the other hand, speaking about the National Highways of the State, Biswajit said that the pending tender for the construction of the 202 kilometre long road stretch from Finch Corner to Tengnoupal, along the Imphal-Ukhrul road, has been completed and necessary proposal has been sent to MoRTH.While the DPR is being compiled, around Rs 180 crore has been sanctioned for improving the road condition. The tender process will be completed soon and the work will be initiated at the earliest, he said.Biswajit continued that Rs 60 crore and Rs 30 crore have been put in the budget after consultation with the Ministry for improving the Canchipur-Lilong and the Tendongyan-Koubru Leikai roads along National Highway 39 respectively.The said works were earlier handed over to a private firm but were stopped due to difference in the rate and lack of some items, the Minister explained.Speaking about externally aided projects, Biswajit said that under the funding of the Asian Development Bank, steps are being taken up for the construction of Imphal Ring Road.The earlier Government initiated the concept and also got the approval but was dropped after it failed to provide necessary land compensation.The present Government, realising the importance of the project, is planning to initiate the work at the earliest.The Minister assured that necessary and appropriate compensation will be provided and ADB and the State Government will sign an MoU in November regarding this project.It is being calculated that the Imphal Ring Road will require around Rs 800 crore and if land compensation is included, the costs will come at around Rs 1180 crore, he said.In a similar manner, elevated highway project, at the cost of Rs 2350 crore, is also being planned.The highway will connect the front area near Manipur University with the area near airport and Koirengei and its junction will be at Nityaipat Chuthek.Plans for extending the said highway to Imphal East are also being discussed and necessary tender for compiling the DPR has been completed, Biswajit informed.The Minister further said that under Manipur State Roads Development Programme, Rs 2350 crore will be sanctioned for the development of the roads in the remote regions of the State."
PARIS-Dec-8-Rich-countries-need-to-stop-using-coal-by-2030-and-oil-and-gas-by-2040-with-poorer-nations-fol,"PARIS, Dec 8 : Rich countries need to stop using coal by 2030 and oil and gas by 2040, with poorer nations following a decade behind, to give the world a chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, climate scientists told the UN Friday.In a note to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Climate Change body, shared with AFP, climate scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Exeter University said there was very little room for anything but a total phase-out of fossil fuels.The steep timeline they laid out comes as climate negotiators at the COP28 talks in Dubai are tussling over the future of oil, gas and coal, responsible for the lion's share of humanity's planet-heating emissions.The UN climate negotiations are tasked with helping the world meet the Paris deal goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, but have often been vague on how that target will be achieved.PIK director Johan Rockstrom said that the new calculations sent to the UN show the world unwinding fossil fuel use at a speed and scale that makes debates at COP28 about decarbonising by 2050 or a gradual ""phasedown"" plan beside the point.""The discussions should be around serious and fair efforts to start implementing a phase out plan,"" he said.

IMPHAL-Oct-8-Construction-of-Barak-and-Makru-bridges-which-are-two-key-bridges-of-NH-37-Imphal-Jiribam-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 8: Construction of Barak and Makru bridges which are two key bridges of NH 37 (Imphal-Jiribam highway) are most likely to be further delayed.Notably, the two bridges are being constructed by BIPL under NHIDCL as implementing agency with funds provided by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).As per the work order, the two bridges should be completed by April next year.However sources in NHIDCL informed that the bridge construction works would be delayed beyond the stipulated period although they would be completed within next year.     Although the State’s overall law and order situation has improved significantly, there have been frequent disturbances in construction of Barak and Makru bridges as well as in the maintenance work of Imphal-Jiribam highway, said the sources.Moreover, the bridge construction works and highway maintenance works are being impeded by excessive rise in the volume of traffic.On account of these factors, completion of Barak and Makru bridges would be delayed by sometime notwithstanding the people’s wish to see them completed as soon as possible, said the sources.Nonetheless, if one takes into account different works to be taken up, NH 37 will be certainly transformed into a very good highway after a couple of years, according to the sources.At the moment, works done on the highway is limited to maintenance part. Yet, there are plans to upgrade the highway to a four-lane highway, re-align it and bore tunnels at extreme corners. A DPR has been already prepared for this project.As a mega project is in pipeline, MoRTH does not like to invest huge amounts in the ongoing maintenance works, said the sources.On the other hand, multiple growth in traffic volume  following marked improvement in the highway’s condition has turned to be a serious factor for wearing out the highway and frequent break down of its bridges, according to the sources.Tender process for construction of a new Irang Bridge with RCC is nearly complete.Vehicles travelling from Imphal cross two bailey bridges after crossing Makru bridge and these bailey bridges have been causing severe difficulties to vehicles during the past few days. However, if construction of the new Makru Bridge is completed, vehicles would not need to cross the two bailey bridges.Most of the bailey bridges of NH 37 have been replaced with RCC bridges. The remaining bailey bridges too would be replaced by RCC bridges one by one, said the sources."

Aizawl-Jan-18-In-a-troubling-turn-of-events-the-ongoing-conflict-in-Myanmar-has-spilled-across-borders-wi,"Aizawl, Jan 18In a troubling turn of events, the ongoing conflict in Myanmar has spilled across borders, with 278 soldiers from the Myanmar Army seeking refuge in Mizoram, a North Eastern State of India. The influx comes in the wake of intensified hostilities between Myanmar’s ruling junta-backed forces and rebel groups, forcing thousands of civilians and military personnel to flee their homeland.The recent incident unfolded near the Karma River, where a clash prompted the armed Myanmar soldiers to cross into Indian territory through the Bandukba area of Lawngtlai District, Mizoram. Fully armed and equipped, the soldiers were escorted to an Assam Rifles camp, highlighting the complexity of the situation.This surge in military personnel seeking asylum compounds an existing refugee crisis in Mizoram. Since early November 2023, around 4,000 to 5,000 people, including 39 army personnel, had already sought refuge in Mizoram’s Champhai district. The region has become a hotspot for those fleeing the conflict, resulting in 21 injuries among the refugees, with five in critical condition requiring medical attention in Aizawl, Mizoram’s capital.The Tyao River, forming part of the international boundary between India and Myanmar, has emerged as a crossing point for those escaping the unrest. Mizoram shares its border with Myanmar, alongside other Indian States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur, all of which share historical ties with Myanmar through heritage, religion, language, and ethnicity.As the crisis deepens, the Mizoram Government and local authorities are grappling with the humanitarian aspects of the situation. Approximately 5,000 refugees, a mix of civilians and military personnel, strain local resources. Awaiting further direction from National agencies, the Mizoram Government remains vigilant about the international and security implications of the Myanmar military’s unexpected presence on Indian soil.The situation remains tense and complex, with the eyes of the world on Mizoram as it manages the fallout of a conflict that transcends borders. The international community anxiously awaits a resolution, hoping for a swift and peaceful end to the turmoil that has displaced thousands and disrupted lives on both sides of the border.The war-torn landscape of Myanmar has triggered a significant influx of both civilians and army personnel seeking refuge in the Indian States  of Mizoram and Manipur. Thousands have crossed the border since the outbreak of conflict in November 2023, escaping the hostilities between Myanmar’s ruling junta-backed forces and rebel factions. The regions, bound by historical ties with Myanmar, have become crucial sanctuaries for those fleeing the unrest. The unexpected arrival of 278 soldiers from the Myanmar Army in Mizoram adds a new dimension to the crisis, highlighting the complexities and challenges of Indian authorities dealing with the situation. As Mizoram and Manipur grapple with this surge in refugees, navigating the broader implications of the conflict on Indian soil has largely become a security concern for the security forces.  Organiser"

Even-as-Chief-Minister-N-Biren-talked-tough-even-going-to-the-extent-of-proclaiming-that-process-is-underway,"Even as Chief Minister N Biren talked tough, even going to the extent of proclaiming that process is underway to lodge a First Information Report against a sitting MLA for uploading a provocative post on X, formerly Twitter, came the news of Kuki militants bombarding Sugnu for the 4th consecutive day. This was on February 17, and fast forward to February 19 and the place continues to be bombarded by Kuki militants with non-chalance so much so that the militants have been able to convey the message that the writ of the Government no longer runs in places where the militants have a presence. So for the 6th consecutive day Sugnu continues to be pummelled and to think that this is the place where peace held out till May 27, 2023, that is after violence erupted in all its ugliness on May 3, 2023. It was on May 28 last year that Sugnu came under heavy attack from Kuki militants and how the attack was repulsed, with human casualties on either side, are stories that have been captured and told to the readers by the different Imphal based newspapers and local television channels. Now come to the second month of the year 2024 and Sugnu occupies prime space in all the major newspapers of Imphal, following the uninterrupted onslaughts from Kuki militants. In the course of the uninterrupted onslaughts, one Head Constable of the BSF and a number of village defenders have been injured and reports coming in more than say that the attacks are launched from Lailoiphai and Dongyang Kuki villages of Churachandpur. The places from where the series of attacks have been launched are confirmed and this is where questions may well be raised on the steps taken up by the Government to neutralise the militants who have launched the attacks from the said two places. What is stopping the Government and the Central security forces from sending their troops to the said two places and take out the militants active there ? This question is raised in the backdrop of the fact that Sugnu has been bombarded by the said militants for the sixth consecutive day. The pattern is unmistakable. If it is Sugnu today, there was Moreh some time back and earlier Khamenlok, Koutruk, Senjam Chirang,  Kadangband, Ningthou-khong Kha Khunou, Khoijumantabi, Napat etc and it should be clear to Imphal and New Delhi that these places are within shooting distance from places where the Kuki-Zos are predominant.  Take two and two together and it should not be too difficult to conclude that there are elements out there who are hell bent on continuing what was done at Torbung and Churachandpur on May 3, 2023.The lies and the deceit should be called out for it has dragged on for far too long. As repeatedly pointed out here in this column, the May 3, 2023 Tribal Solidarity Rally was staged on the false premise of the directive to the State Government from the High Court of Manipur to send the socio-economic reports of the Meiteis to the Centre to study the demand that the Meiteis be included in the ST list of the Constitution of India. The Sangai Express has called out this lie on more than one occasion, reminding all that the ST for Meiteis demand dates back more than 10 years and in the more than one decade of the demand being raised, never once has it taken the form of targeting anyone or any community. Even today, the demand is before the Government and is not directed against any community and it is for this reason why The Sangai Express has given the platform to everyone to discuss and debate over the demand that the Meiteis be granted the ST tag. It is along this line that the recent representation to the Governor not to entertain the ST for Meiteis demand by the All Naga Students’ Association, Manipur (ANSAM) is seen and understood. Let there be debates and discussions on this, but why was a rally supposed to be held against this demand get reduced to an exercise of targeting the Meiteis and their houses at Torbung and Churachandpur on May 3, 2023 ? This is a question which the fantastically christened Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum and ATSUM have failed to answer to this day. And it is on this false premise that places like Sugnu continue to be bombarded by Kuki militants and this is where one is left wondering what is stopping New Delhi and Imphal from sending their troops to the two villages from where the attacks are being launched and neutralise the Kuki militants."

Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence is becoming more and more relevant in the contemporary world which is plagued by violence of varying degree and nature.Mahatma Gandhi was a very rare leader of the entire humanity who lived by his words.Even though Mahatma Gandhi believed in Hinduism, he treated all religion equally and there was nothing sectarian in all his perspectives, Gaikhangam remarked.By assassinating Mahatma Gandhi, the killers only exposed that they believed in violence. No one who believed in non-violence would ever think about killing Mahatma Gandhi, the champion of peace and non-violence, he asserted.Even though most of the teachings and messages of Mahatma Gandhi are challenging, his philosophies and beliefs like ‘truth always triumphs’ are being studied across the world.However, some organisations of the country have been working hard to influence the masses to reject Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy and teachings, decried the MPCC president.The seminar was attended by Congress MLAs, ex-MLAs, party leaders and a number of students."
Islamic-State-alert-sounded-in-Bangladesh-India,"DHAKA, Apr 27Bangladesh and Indian intelligence have been duly alerted about a pro-Islamic State telegram in Bengali doing the rounds in Internet that promises militant action soon.Top Bangladesh intelligence officials say they have interacted with their Indian counterparts and decided to sound a nationwide alert over the poster in Bengali that says ‘Shigroi Asche Inshallah’ (God, willing, coming soon).It has the logo of an unknown group Al Mursalat, which could well be the Arabic code for Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) which carried out the deadly attack on Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka three years ago.That this threat of action is in Bengali has been interpreted by Bangladesh intelligence as a prelude to possible suicide attacks in Bangladesh and in east and Northeast India, where the neo-JMB (formed after reorganisation following death or arrest of most of its leaders in Bangladesh in a police crackdown after the Holey Artisan attack) is active.It is an Islamist terror group comprising of recruits from Bangladesh, West Bengal and Assam and operates on a trans-regional basis with some of their activists even nabbed from southern Indian states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In fact, at the moment, the group is said to have equal number of activists from Indian states and Bangladesh.Bangladesh intelligence is looking into reports that the neo-JMB has links with Sri Lanka’s National Towheed Jamaath (NTJ) which carried out the deadly suicide bombings on Easter Day (April 21).Like the NTJ, the neo-JMB is loosely connected to the Islamic State, which owns up domestic radical groups across the world if they conform to its ideological tenets of hardline Salafist Islam.For the IS and the neo-JMB, India is an ‘oppressor Hindu state’ while Bangladesh, though a Muslim majority country, is run by a ‘Murtad’ (apostate) regime, which is how it belittles the Sheikh Hasina Government that runs on secular principles.“We don’t rule out simultaneous attacks in Bangladesh and adjacent Indian states like West Bengal and Assam and so we take this threat on the IS handle seriously. We will not make the mistake that the Sri Lankans made of neglecting the alert,” said a top Bangladesh intelligence official.He added, “We share a ‘high degree of intelligence cooperation’ with India.”“Since India alerted Sri Lanka early in April about the impending suicide bombings with very specific details and since it has better intelligence capabilities, we expect the Indian agencies will check out the IS threat sooner than later,” he said, but was not willing to be named.

The-number-of-displaced-persons-has-been-pegged-at-anywhere-above-the-50-thousand-mark-but-there-is-as-yet-no,"The number of displaced persons has been pegged at anywhere above the 50 thousand mark but there is as yet no data on the number of children who make up the 50 thousand number of displaced persons. Perhaps this is something which the relevant Government authority would do well to work out and make it public. It is in keeping with the rights of children and to ensure that whatever possible is done for their welfare that the Manipur Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MCPCR) has come out with a list of dos and don’ts for children staying at the relief centres spread across the length and breadth of the State.  Enrol them in the neighbourhood schools is one such advisory that has been issued and while there is no data on whether any of the displaced children have been forced to discontinue with their studies, it is nonetheless significant that the MCPCR has deemed it necessary to headline its advisories with this instruction. The question is how many children are among those taking refuge in the different relief centres ? An answer to this would be highly welcomed and out of them how many are actually going to school and how many have been forced to drop out ? Given that many families have lost their source of income and given the manner in which the economy of the State has been hit badly, this question should be relevant. The Government must be tied up with the numerous issues that have arisen following May 3, 2023, but the plight of children is something that cannot be ignored. Another important point which the MCPCR has raised is the directive to the different schools to ensure that no child is forced to drop out due to the inability of the parents, elders and others of the family to meet their financial requirements. This is where the relevant Government Departments must be asked to step in and see what they can do. School uniforms, text books and stationery items should be provided to the displaced children on a priority basis as asked by the MCPCR. For those who are better placed, perhaps they may be asked to donate whatever they can to meet the study requirements of the children who have been forced out of their homes and survive in the many relief centres set up all over the State. This is where the Government must step in and take the lead. Show the way is the one line suggestion that comes to mind. The public too need to respond positively to any course of action taken up by the Government for the sake of the displaced children and perhaps this is where voluntary organisations may mobilise public participation to contribute for the sake of the children, whose lives have been so mercilessly uprooted in the madness unleashed by the machination of some adults who have an agenda of their own. Health, nutrition including piping hot cooked food, recreation are some of the points raised by the MCPCR and the point is, nothing should be left to chance to let the children experience a ‘normal’ growing up period.Just one day before the MCPCR came out with its list of advisories for children in relief centres, came the news of the Social Welfare Department getting in touch with their Maharashtra counterpart and ensuring the rescue of five children from a school at Nashik. Of the five children thus rescued, one bears tell tale signs of being assaulted in the school and in the present context, when so many children are currently surviving in different relief centres, the need to be cautious has become all that more important. It is in keeping this reality that the MCPCR also issued another notification asking parents, guardians, agencies or organi- sations concerned to furnish details of children who have been sent outside Manipur for their further studies as well as details of the institutions where they are studying. Parents, guardians and elders opting for something better for their children is a given, more so when they have been displaced and the education of their youngsters seems to be at the crossroad but this is all the more reason for everyone to be more cautious than ever before. The MCPCR seems to be on track to keep a tab on the welfare of children in the different relief centres and it is only right that the people as a whole respond accordingly. Manipur is suffering, more so the children, especially those who have been driven out of their homes and it is only right that due thoughts are given to the plight of the many children staying at the different relief centres. One also hopes the State Govt comes out with some plan of action for the displaced kids."
A-massive-protest-demonstration-was-staged-on-Saturday-at-Moreh-on-the-primary-demand-of-restoration-of-peace,"A massive protest demonstration was staged on Saturday at Moreh on the primary demand of restoration of peace at the border town and opening of educational institutions. No doubt, there should be peace not only at Moreh but all across Manipur. However, with a premeditated and sustained war for creation of a separate and exclusive domain for Kuki-Zo people raging across the State, peace remains elusive although a large section of people yearns for it. The civil society organisations of Moreh have been asking for withdrawal of State security forces from the border town. Saturday’s protest demonstration was also directed against the State security forces. In another word, these so called CSOs have been blaming the State security forces for the violence and/or the restive situation prevailing in the border town. This is simply preposterous, to say the least. Chingtham Anandkumar, SDPO Moreh was gunned down by Kuki militants in the heart of Moreh town on October 31, 2023. Again, two IRB personnel were killed in another dastardly attack carried out by Kuki militants on January 17, 2024. In between, there were repeated attacks against state forces deployed in the border town. Still then, the state security forces have been acting within the confines of the law and as per the rule book whereas the Kuki militants have been violating all the established laws and openly challenging the very foundation of Manipur. Strangely, the Kuki CSOs did not bother to utter a single word of condemnation against the terror attacks. In fact, State security forces are at the receiving end of the relentless attacks by Kuki militants but the so called CSOs of Moreh have the audacity to blame State security forces for the restive situation besieging the border town.A memorandum submitted by several Kuki CSOs to Union Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that State security forces are the main obstacle in the restoration of peace in Moreh. This is quite absurd but understandable given the common agenda of Kuki militant groups and Kuki CSOs to create an exclusive and separate administration for Kuki-Zo people outside the state of Manipur. Hours after the premeditated and pre-planned aggression erupted in Churachandpur on May 3, 2023, Meitei community of Moreh were also targeted. Thousands of Kuki-Chin militants and their supporters attacked Meitei families and burnt down their houses. Caught totally off-guard, the unsuspecting Meiteis had to flee for their life. Hundreds of them including women, children, sick and aged had to take refuge in the jungles of Myanmar (Burma) for months before they were eventually rescued. After cleansing the Meitei community from Moreh, the next strategy of the Chin-Kuki militants and their supporters was to block the entry of state forces in Moreh because they know that as long as state forces are stationed in Moreh, Meetei will come back and resettle in the border town. It came as a major setback to the champions of the Kuki-Zo separate administration that they could not block the entry of state forces into Moreh. In their attempts to drive away the state security forces, Chin-Kuki militants have been repeatedly attacking the security forces. These persistent terror attacks are the primary and principal cause of whatever violence or the restive situation besieging the border town. The blame heaped on state forces is just a part of the propaganda warfare which is devoid of even an iota of truth. First, the Meiteis were cleansed from Moreh and now the champions of separate administration including both militant groups and CSOs are making all efforts to see withdrawal of state forces from the border town either through physical warfare or propaganda warfare or both, with a not so veiled intention to claim exclusive ownership of Moreh. Even a high school student can see through this plan. Stop terror attacks and let there be rule of law; Moreh will be as peaceful as it ever was."

Diphiu-PrinmaiIt-was-William-McCulloch-the-British-Political-Agent-in-Manipur-who-resettled-the-Kukis-in-18,"Diphiu PrinmaiIt was William McCulloch, the British Political Agent in Manipur who resettled the Kukis in 1840s in the ancestral lands of the Nagas to create his infamous ‘buffer zone’ as a policy to contain any resistance by pitching the Kuki mercenaries against the Nagas, the Burmese and the Lushais. According to Sir James Johnstone 'My Experience in Manipur and the Naga Hills' the Kukis are a wandering race consisting of several tribes who have been working up from the south. The term SADAR Hills was coined by JC Higgins in the 1930s as an acronym for Selected Area Development Administrative Region (SADAR) for the purpose of accommodating ex-servicemen. SADAR hills came into existence on 22nd May, 1947 and later upgraded to a sub-division on 25th May, 1951. Decades later in the 1970s the Kukis began to demand for a district of their own known as Sadar Hills District.They were first heard as Kukis in Manipur between 1830s and 1840s. Subsequently, during the transitional periods of 1961 coup, 1988 ethnic conflicts and 2021 Military Coup, thousands of Kuki refugees fled from Burma and entered Manipur from the porous 1,643 km Indo-Myanmar border.There was no system or mechanism to filter such infiltration and scrutinize fabrications of Government records and forgery of personal documents to become a citizen of the State. Thus, began the illegal and unchecked infiltration of the refugees who became a Scheduled Tribe of India overnight and settled in Manipur.The bureaucrats turned a blind eye to such development while their political masters continue to cultivate their vote banks and augment this illegal growth of population. In order to achieve bloated vote banks and also grabbing the land of indigenous citizens, the politicians implemented a divisive policy of employing their own puppets (bureaucrats) in all key Government departments to ensure smooth documentation process.It was on the midnight of 08 December, 2016 the State Government of Manipur led by the then Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh declared 7 districts including Kangpokpi defying the four Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the United Naga Council (UNC), Manipur and the Government of Manipur, that the Sadar Hills district cannot be created without due consultation and the consent of the indigenous Naga land owners.Leave alone consulting the United Naga Council, the State Government did not consult even the Constitutional body, the Hill Area Committee (HAC) while creating this controversial district. Thus, finally the Manipur Government in order to quench its political thirst granted the Kukis’ demand by formally naming the new district as Kangpokpi, comprising of nine Kuki sub-divisions, Saitu Gamphazol, Kangpokpi, Saikul, Kangchup Geljang, Bungte Chiru, Champhai, T Waichong, Lungtin and Island.The exponential growth of new villages due to uncontrolled influx of illegal immigration mainly from Myanmar (Burma) being facilitated for electoral gain in the last seventy (70) years in the State had caused rampant settlement in Kangpokpi District. Over a period of time these illegal immigrants known as the Kuki have maintained a demographic edge over the newly-created district of Kangpokpi.The creation of new district turns out to be a well-laid political plan, ‘a demographic engineering’ to tilt the balance of power against the genuine indigenous Nagas. A deliberate and continuous attempt is being made to reduce the indigenous citizens to voiceless and invisible minorities in our own land through a systematic and divisive structural manipulation. In the new Kangpokpi district the Nagas are divided and placed in different Constituencies or segments thus weakening their political thrust and making them handicapped to thrive politically.To recapitulate the exponential growth of the Kuki population which has caused demographic imbalances one has to carry out a comparative analysis of 1951 & 2021 census and increase in number of villages. In the 1951 census the total population of Senapati district (Naga, Kuki and Nepali) was 46,608 out of which the Kuki population under Senapati district was just a few thousand. But in 2021, the Kuki population soared to unbelievably 2.80 lakh. How this illogically humongous figure has been achieved within 70 years is a question to be answered. Secondly, in 1969 there were a total of 179 villages (Naga, Kuki, Nepali) while according to 1972 report there were only 27 Kuki villages but in the report of 2023 it is seen that a total of 542 new villages have been increased in Kangpokpi District.The total Kuki villages in entire Manipur are now 1878 from just a mere figure of 73 in the year 1881. The overwhelming growth of villages could be due to unlawful recognizing by the concern department of the Government. At this rampant growth rate, the days are not far off when the indigenous people will be displaced and face the status of refugee.Further, the establishment of SoO camp in Koubru Range and extortion along the IT-road (Imphal-Tamei road ) has brought distress beyond limit to the commuters and small traders in the area. To add to the misery of the indigenous people the rampant cultivation of poppy and timber logging has brought in environmental degradation in the area. Surprisingly, inspite of unrestrained extortion and harassment the State Government or its police system have failed miserably to attend to the reports of the victims. The only saving grace is the deployment of Assam Riffles post at Gelnal, which gave some sense of security to a certain stretch of the IT road.Therefore, it’s high time the present Government develop a platform where the indigenous minorities can exercise their democratic rights and empower themselves politically in their own land.The Government must roll back the newly created districts and re- organize to keep all the indigenous minorities under one umbrella and not let them further succumb to the divisive political policies, which have been applied since last 5 decades. The indigenous communities have been deprived of all developmental packages for long in their own land. Hence, the attention of the present Government is drawn towards providing political and economical justice to indigenous Naga people living in Kangpokpi district.Writer can be reached at[email protected]"

New-Delhi-Dec-11Article-370-of-the-Constitution-which-bestowed-special-status-on-the-erstwhile-state-of-Ja,"New Delhi, Dec 11Article 370 of the Constitution, which bestowed special status on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was a “temporary provision”, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday.In a landmark verdict, the apex court unanimously upheld the Centre’s August 5, 2019 decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370, while directing restoration of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest and holding of the assembly elections by September 30, 2024.A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, in its three concurring judgements, dealt with the question of whether the provisions of Article 370 were temporary in nature or they acquired a permanent status in the Constitution at the end of the J&K Constituent Assembly’s tenure in 1957.“We have held that Article 370 is a temporary provision on a reading of the historical context in which it was included,” said the CJI, who wrote the judgement for himself and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant.He said Article 370 was introduced to serve two purposes, including the transitional purpose to provide for an interim arrangement until the Constituent Assembly of the state was formed and could take a decision on the legislative competence of the Union on matters other than the ones stipulated in the Instrument of Accession and ratify the Constitution.Justice Chandrachud said the second was a temporary purpose, an interim arrangement in view of the special circumstances because of the war conditions in the state.“We have held that a textual reading of Article 370 also indicates that it is a temporary provision. For this purpose, we have referred to the placement of the provision in Part XXI of the Constitution which deals with temporary and transitional provisions, the marginal note of the provision which states ‘temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir’, and a reading of Articles 370 and 1 by which the State became an integral part of India upon the adoption of the Constitution,” he said.Article 1 says India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of states and Jammu and Kashmir features in it as a state.The CJI said if the contention of the petitioners on the interpretation of Article 370 regarding the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was accepted, then Article 370(3) would become redundant and would lose its temporary character.Article 370(3) of the Constitution says notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this article, the President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify: Provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification.“It can be garnered from the historical context for the inclusion of Article 370 and the placement of Article 370 in Part XXI of the Constitution that it is a temporary provision,” the apex court concluded.In his separate verdict, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said the purpose of Article 370 was to slowly bring J&K on par with other states.Justice Sanjiv Khanna, in his separate verdict, concurred with the CJI and Justice Kaul and gave his own reasons for the conclusion.The petitions challenging the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 and the validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 that divided the erstwhile state into the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were referred to the Constitution bench in 2019.

LPG is supplied to all the Northeastern States including Sikkim from this loading point.The All Manipur Petroleum Products Drivers Association decided to suspend transportation of LPG  and petroleum products in view of the total lockdown being imposed in Assam, detection of COVID-19 cases among officials working at the North Guwahati LPG bottling plant and presence of sufficient stocks of LPG, petrol and diesel at Imphal.As the daily sale of petrol and diesel declined drastically during the last three months or so on account of the COVID-19 lockdown, there are sufficient stocks of petrol and diesel at the Malom depot.There is also enough stock of LPG at the Sekmai bottling plant, sources said.  Even though total lockdown has been imposed in Assam, IOCL’s loading points located in the State (Assam) have been operating as usual. However, drivers  have been facing many difficulties as their basic requirements are not available due to the lockdown.All these points were discussed thoroughly at a meeting of the All Manipur Petroleum Products Drivers Association held yesterday. As Manipur would not be facing any shortage of LPG, petrol and diesel in the coming weeks, the association submitted a representation to the Chief Depot Manager of Malom Depot stating that movement of CRPF-escorted empty oil tankers and LPG TTs would be suspended till July 9."

NEW-DELHI-Jan-8Union-Home-Minister-Amit-Shah-said-on-February-8-that-the-Government-has-decided-to-scrap-th,"NEW DELHI, Jan 8Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on February 8 that the Government has decided to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) along Myanmar border to ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India’s North Eastern States. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has recommended the immediate suspension of FMR, he said.“It is Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji’s resolve to secure our borders. MHA has decided that the FMR between India and Myanmar be scrapped to ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India’s North Eastern States bordering Myanmar. Since the Ministry of External Affairs is currently in the process of scrapping it, MHA has recommended the immediate suspension of the FMR,” Mr. Shah posted on X.Under the FMR, any member of a hill tribe, who is a citizen of either India or Myanmar, and who resides within 16 km of the border on either side, can cross on the production of a border pass, usually valid for a year, and can stay up to two weeks per visit.Porous borderIndia and Myanmar share an unfenced 1,643 km-long border and people on either side have familial and ethnic ties, which had initially prompted the arrangement. A 1968 Government notification limited the free movement of people up to 40 km on either side of the border, which was further reduced to 16 km in 2004. The FMR’s provisions were last revised in 2016.In its 2011-12 annual report, the MHA observed that the FMR makes the international border extremely porous, and the hilly and inhospitable terrain provides cover to the activities of various Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs). “The unfenced Indo-Myanmar border with FMR is thus being exploited by various IIGs,” the report said.The India-Myanmar border passes through the States of Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215 km), Manipur (398 km), and Mizoram (510 km).Slow fencing progressThe Union Government had initially planned to fence a 10 km stretch along the border at Moreh in Manipur in 2010 and 4.07 km of fencing had been put up till 2013-14, while the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power. The MHA’s latest annual report for 2022-23 says that 6.81 km of fencing has been completed, which means that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government has added less than three km of fencing over a nine year period. Out of 1,643 km, the demarcation of 1,472 km has been completed.Earlier on February 6, Mr. Shah announced that a fence will be constructed along the entire 1643-km border with Myanmar.“Out of the total border length, a 10 km stretch in Moreh, Manipur, has already been fenced. Furthermore, two pilot projects of fencing through a Hybrid Surveillance System (HSS) are under execution. They will fence a stretch of 1 km each in Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. Additionally, fence works covering approx 20 km in Manipur have also been approved, and the work will start soon,” he added.A tender floated last year for HSS estimated the cost of the project at Rs 3.2 crore for one km.Ambiguous implementationOfficials pointed out that FMR had several drawbacks and its implementation always fell in the grey.“There is no standard document or border pass recognised by both the countries. Though Assam Rifles, a Central force is deployed along the Myanmar border, the implementation of FMR through border passes is done by the State Government officials. The other international borders such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, the border check posts are manned by Bureau of Immigration officials under MHA,” said the official.The official added though FMR allows two visits per week, there is no mechanism to check when the person has entered. “If someone is caught along the border, theysimply say that they entered a while ago. There are people who live in Myanmar but work in India during the day,” the official added.Another official said that the terrain was such that in some places one part of a house falls in Myanmar and the other in India.Not a priority for MyanmarThe official added that the issue of streamlining the FMR has been discussed with Myanmar on several occasions, but that the neighbouring country showed no urgency on the issue. “For Myanmar, the western border with India is relatively peaceful, in comparison to its eastern or northern borders. They have always dithered on the subject. Now with a military coup in place in the country since February 2021 and the subsequent civil war, it is not a priority for them,” the official said.Mr. Shah’s announcement on the FMR comes soon after his February 3 meeting with Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh in Delhi. The CM has often blamed the FMR for the ongoing ethnic violence between the tribal Kuki-Zo and the Meitei communities in the State, though in fact, Manipur had suspended the regime in 2020 itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The tribal Zo people have a major presence in Manipur and Mizoram, as well as in parts of Assam and Nagaland, and adjoining areas of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Similarly, Nagas live in Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam, as well as in neighbouring Myanmar.  The Hindu"

New-Delhi-Mar-9-The-Election-Commission-of-India-will-visit-Jammu-and-Kashmir-from-Monday-to-Wednesday-to-a,"New Delhi, Mar 9The Election Commission of India will visit Jammu and Kashmir from Monday to Wednesday to assess when polls can be held in the Union Territory and the dates for the Lok Sabha elections are likely to be revealed immediately after that, sources have told NDTV. The announcement may be made on Thursday or Friday.The Commission's visit to Jammu and Kashmir comes after the Supreme Court had directed it to hold Assembly elections in the Union Territory (UT) by September. The Centre had then asked the panel to assess whether the Assembly elections in the UT could be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections.""Once the assessment is complete and the visit ends on Wednesday, the commission may announce the dates for the Lok Sabha elections on Thursday or Friday,"" a source said. The model code of conduct will come into effect as soon as the elections are announced and parties have been making promises and inaugurating projects on a war footing before that happens.As far as the polls in Jammu and Kashmir are concerned, the commission has been given a full briefing by the security establish- ment and the entire panel, including Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioner Arun Goel, will visit the Union Territory.The last Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir were held in 2014 and the State was bifurcated after Article 370, which gave it special status, was abrogated in 2019. The Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh came into existence after that.During a hearing on a bunch of petitions challenging the scrapping of Article 370, the Supreme Court had, in December last year, directed the Election Commi- ssion to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30. Upholding the Union Government's decision to abrogate Article 370, the Court had directed it to take steps to restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest.In the 2014 Assembly elections, the People's Democratic Party led by Mehbooba Mufti and the BJP had formed a coalition Government. It collapsed in 2018 after the BJP pulled its support and Jammu and Kashmir has not had an elected Government since then.The PDP is now part of the INDIA Alliance but there have been rumblings after the Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) said it will contest all three seats in Kashmir on its own and leave the two in Jammu for the Congress.Terming the NC's decision ""disappointing"", Ms Mufti also accused the NC of reducing the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) to a ""joke"". The PAGD is an alliance of parties, including the NC and the PDP, that had come together to seek the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's special status.  NDTV"

Chief-Minister-N-Biren-Singh-inaugurated-a-new-staff-quar-ters-building-of-Community-Health-Centre-Yairipok-,"Imphal, Oct 5 (DIPR)Chief Minister N Biren Singh inaugurated a new staff quar-ters building of Community Health Centre, Yairipok Yambem and an Under Graduate Girls’ Hostel at Top Chingtha under Andro Assembly constituency in Imphal East district today.Speaking at the inaugural function of the CHC staff quarters at Yairipok Yam-bem, the Chief Minister stated that the Yambem PHC has been upgraded to the status of a Community Health Centre as per a Cabinet decision.He assured that doctors, nurses and staff required at the CHC will be looked into and the requisite staff would be sent as early as possible. The Govt will look into the feasibility of upgrading Yambem Aided High school to a full fledged Govt High school. He also stated that the State's financial position has been improving gradually.Forest and Environment Minister Th Shyamkumar said he is optimistic that the Chief Minister will definitely provide the required infrastructure and manpower of the CHC. He also said that Yambem Aided High school which was constructed under the funding of Ministry of Minority Affairs, Govt of India should be taken over by the Govt. for the welfare of students’ community.Speaking at the inaugural function of the Under Graduate Girls’ Hostel at Top Chingtha, the Chief Minister stated that the Govt has taken up mass tree plantation programme under the CM’s  Green Manipur Mission in order to reduce to the adverse impacts of global warming. Under this mission, Govt made an appeal to donate five to ten acres of land for tree plantation in each and every village.The Chief Minister assured that the right side main canal of Thoubal Dam would be made fully functional at the earliest. SDC Tulihal office which was shifted to Imphal due to law and order situation would be brought back to its own place.Biren stated that the ‘Go to Hills’ mission had bridged the gap between hill and valley people and strengthened the sense of oneness. On the other hand, the ‘Go to Village’ mission enabled the Government to understand people’s woes, grievances and necessities.Now ‘School Fagathansi’ mission has been launched with an ambitious objective to provide free and quality education to students, he said and expressed hope that the new mission would certainly benefit thousands of students.Stating that major chunk of parents’ earnings is generally spent in children’s education, the Chief Minister expressed hope that parents would now be able to save their hard earned money for their future.The State could achieve marked changes in school education sector in the last two years and the overall pass percentage in HSLC examination touched an all-time high of 74.69% which is the highest since establishment of BOSEM in 1972.Many people have benefited from various welfare schemes introduced by the present Govt like CMHT, CMST, Meeyamgi Numit, Hill Leaders Day and Go to Village, he added.Forest and Environment Minister Th Shyamkumar, Deputy Speaker K Robindro Singh, Chairman, Manipur Building & Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, H Dingo Singh, and Vice Chairman, MIDA O Lukhoi Singh also spoke at the occasion.Later, dignitaries planted tree saplings in and around the Nongpok Ningthou Panthoibi Sanglen.DC Imphal East Dr Rangitabali Waikhom, Director, Minority Affairs Ng.

Extraordinary-times-call-for-extraordinary-measures-and-it-is-probably-along-this-line-that-the-State-Governme,"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and it is probably along this line that the State Government has decided to call out the Assam Rifles from their bunkers to be deployed at what it says are the sensitive points in at least six districts. Notifications calling out the Assam Rifles have already been issued under the name and seal of the Deputy Commissioners of Imphal West, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Chura-chandpur, Kangpokpi and Tengnoupal and when contacted even as this commentary is being penned down, The Sangai Express was informed that a similar notification will also be issued for Imphal East later in the night. Already the net is abuzz with news of the Army or Assam Rifles being called out and pressed into service, leading many to speculate whether this amounts to taking one step closer to leaving the doors wide open for the infamous Army Act, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act to return at its menacing best. At the moment this sounds a little too presumptuous for this is a situation which the State police cannot handle, but given that police commandos across different districts, primarily in the valley districts, had decided to lay down arms in protest should say something very significant. And this significance, the part of which has been left unsaid should be clear, very clear to all those out there flexing their muscles and cocking a snook at the rule of law. It should not be forgotten that there is a legally elected Government in place at Imphal and obviously New Delhi must be watching every development here with a hawk’s eye. Does not portend well for Manipur and her people and if this is not noted and acknowledged then the real possibility of giving a totally new dimension to the ongoing clash between the Kukis and the Meiteis cannot be written off that easily.  In such an eventuality it is Manipur which stands to lose and all concerned should take note of this. What has been happening here, particularly at Imphal in the last few days, should be taken into consideration to understand why the Assam Rifles personnel have been called out. That this particular order of calling out the Assam Rifles just one day after the slogan of ‘Go back Assam Rifles’, ‘Leave Assam Rifles’ filled the evening and night of Imphal and other places in the valley districts should say something very, very significant. It should also be acknowledged that the very decision of calling out the Assam Rifles could not have been taken without a nod from New Delhi. A point which Manipur cannot afford to overlook.This is also the time for the Government at Imphal to admit that several power players have emerged basically because it failed to dispense with its duty of protecting the people and their livelihood. Rewind to May 3, 2023 and the days that followed and it should be more than clear that the presence of the Government was not felt or understood at all. Even today, no Meitei would dare to take the National Highway from Imphal to Dimapur passing through Kangpokpi. No Meitei civilian would dare proceed to Moreh or Churachandpur. Likewise no Kuki would dare to enter Imphal or any of the valley districts. And this has been going on for more than nine months now. In such a situation it is but not surprising to see so many power players emerge all over the place and if it is the words of the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) that hold sway at Churachandpur, it is the Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU) at Kangpokpi. Likewise in the valley districts there are several organisations which have already made their presence felt, with what happened to the residence of the Additional SP of Imphal West police a few days back standing out as a prime example. The arms laying down protest staged by police commandos should be seen in conjunction with the attack launched at the residence of the said police officer. As noted in an earlier commentary here, the script seems set to push Manipur into a state of anarchy and the decision to call out the Assam Rifles in at least six districts as of now should be seen in the context of the State Government totally failing to dispense with its duty of maintaining law and order. A subject which the police should be able to do, but  the reality says something else and this is the tragedy of it all."

As such, candidates can now file their nomination papers.Even though NPF has officially its candidate for the Outer Manipur PC, neither BJP nor Congress has named their candidates for the two Lok Sabha seats of Manipur, with speculations going viral.Alfred K Arthur is the sole intending Congress candidate in the Outer Parliamentary Constituency.NPF candidate for Outer Manipur PC, Kachui Timothy Zimik, a retired IRS officer, is a resident of Sanakeithel, Ukhrul.CPI has already named L Sotinkumar as its candidate for Inner Manipur PC.The Chief Electoral Officer, Manipur has already notified that candidates can file their nomination papers till March 27 and scrutiny would be done on March 28.March 30 is the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers.Electors of 47 Assembly segments including all the Assembly segments of Inner Manipur PC and 15 Assembly segments of Outer Manipur PC would go to polls in the first phase on April 19.The remaining 13 Assembly segments of Outer Manipur PC would go to polls in the second phase on April 26.Notably, 32 Assembly segments come under Inner Manipur PC while 28 Assembly segments are clubbed under Outer Manipur PC.The two Parliamentary Constituencies have a total of 20,29,023 voters including 9,80,855 males, 10,47,929 females and 239 transgenders.There would be 2955 polling stations in the two Parliamentary Constituencies.Meanwhile, poll preparedness has started in full swing at the District Election Office, Imphal West with various district committees actively engaging in poll-related activities, conveyed a press release issued by DIPR.As per the election notification issued today, nomination papers may be delivered by a candidate or any of his/her proposers to the Returning Officer for No 1-Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency or Dr Md.

Dipak-KurmiAs-the-Lok-Sabha-elections-loom-on-the-horizon-the-Bharatiya-Janata-Party-BJP-has-initiated-a,"Dipak KurmiAs the Lok Sabha elections loom on the horizon, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has initiated a two-week-long campaign to gather insights for its election manifesto. Demonstra- ting its robust organizational capabilities, the party has deployed video chariots to collect suggestions from various Assembly Constituencies. Utilizing diverse channels, the BJP encourages inputs through the NaMo App, has stationed 6,000 suggestion boxes Nationwide, and engaged its cadres in direct interactions with potential voters. By March 15, the BJP aims to accumulate perspectives from ten million Indians for its 2024 general elections manifesto, known as the ""Sankalp Patra"" or Letter of Resolution. Subsequently, the party will distill key defense and security-related issues to shape the BJP's 2024 manifesto.The BJP's manifestos for both 2014 and 2019 highlighted four significant and various minor defense-related concerns. Initially, the manifesto criticized the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government for what it perceived as lax security measures, attributing it to multiple border intrusions by China and Pakis- tan.The manifesto also pointed out deficiencies in combat aircraft, warships, and submarines, as well as several accidents involving naval warships. Additionally, the document under- scored the escalating pressure from ""Pakistan-backed terror groups"" and the issue of illegal immigration from Bangladesh. While these concerns are provocative, they are not novel occurrences in the political discourse.The second focal point in the BJP manifesto involved a commitment to ""update"" India's nuclear doctrine, sparking speculation about a potential shift from its longstanding ""No First Use"" policy. The 2014 manifesto specifically pledged to ""Study in detail India's nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges of current times."" The ambiguity surrounding this state- ment left room for interpretation, raising questions about whether it implied a bolstering of the overall nuclear deterrent or the development of a tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) arsenal to counter Pakistan's similarly touted TNW capabilities.However, despite the initial discourse, no concrete developments materia- lized on this front.In its 2014 manifesto, the BJP made a commitment to reorganize higher defense management, a notable proposal despite the NDA's historical reluctance to appoint a tri-service Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) during its own tenure.The manifesto specifically pledged to ""ensure greater participation of Armed Forces in the decision-making process of the Ministry of Defence (MoD).""(To be contd)"

Aditya L1 will reach Lagrange point on January 6 at 4 pm. We will have a very controlled burn of the engine of Aditya L1 so that it enters an orbit called the halo orbit,"" Somanath said at Techfest 2023, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay's annual science and technology event.Lagrange point is a region where gravity between Earth and Sun will neutralise. Absolute neutralisation is not possible because there are other bodies like the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mr Somanath said.All six payloads have been tested and ""working beautifully"", he said, adding all are giving very good data.""After the insertion the satellite will be destined to look at the Sun forever as long as its electronics inside are healthy and ready to transmit data. We hope to find out a lot of correlation between the solar corona and mass ejection and impact on space weather we are facing everyday,"" Mr Somanath added.On Chandrayaan-3, India's lunar mission, Mr Somanath said after 14 days of its contribution of collecting data, the Pragyan rover is ""sleeping very well"" on the lunar surface.""It is sleeping forever in history. Unfortunately, we were hoping it would wake up, but it did not happen. When we tested the whole system in our laboratory, it was working,"" he said.Mr Somanath explained that some systems that worked in the laboratory may not work on the lunar surface due to various reasons like radiation.

The HKH region is very active seismologically. The reason why people in northwest India and Delhi felt is for relatively longer time is because of the depth. The depth of the fault is over 150 km so first primary waves were felt and then secondary waves. Aftershocks are likely now but they can't be forecast"", JL Gautam, head of office and Scientist at National Center for Seismology, said.The epicenter of the earthquake is believed to be 90 km from Kalafgan in Afghanistan.

NEW-DELHI-Dec-17-In-a-daring-journey-that-began-in-early-December-a-covert-mission-traced-the-perilous-rou,"NEW DELHI, Dec 17In a daring journey that began in early December, a covert mission traced the perilous route of “organic ganja (cannabis)” from the lush landscapes of Thailand to the heart of Delhi.Starting its journey in Phuket, this contraband skillfully navigates the hidden pathways of Southeast Asia, evading authorities and making its way towards India.Once it reaches the Golden Triangle on India’s North East border that shares boundaries with Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand; it begins it journey into the country through Manipur and Dimapur in Nagaland.It travels from the lush North Eastern landscapes to the bustling cities of the country, particularly Delhi by train, bus, private vehicles and private delivery apps and services.It also exploits social media that has been transformed into a rendezvous point for traffickers and clients, further entrenching the virtual roots of this clandestine network.DLF Capital Greens in Moti Nagar emerged as the epicentre for this clandestine operation, seamlessly blending connections from the North East with the National capital’s urban landscape.Upon interrogation of Nongmaitham Jashobanta Singh and Thiyam Rabikanta Singh, the masterminds behind the drug operation, additional information surfaced, shedding light on the intricate orchestration of supply chains and syndicates.“Rudransh Gupta, one of the accused in the illicit drug activities, detailed a collaboration wherein ganja was clandestinely transported from Manipur to Delhi through covert messengers, using delivery services as inconspicuous carriers,” revealed, Special Commissioner of Police (Crime), Ravindra Singh Yadav, emphasising their involvement in supplying contrabands to students in the city and its outskirts.An official told IANS that drugs being smuggled from the Golden Triangle are coming to Delhi in huge quantities and several people have been caught for their involvement in supplying the contraband from North Eastern States in the city.Seizures surge: Delhi Police’s war on drugsDelhi Police’s data for the first quarter of the year exposes a chilling reality with over 20 kg of heroin and 800 kg of ganja seized during that period which was worth several crores in the illegal drug market.Since January, the police seized around 20 kg of heroin/smack, 15 kg of cocaine, 800 kg of ganja, and 125 kg of opium in various operations across Delhi.NCB’s alarming report: Sea routes fuel 70 per cent of illegal drug influxThe annual report by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in 2022 revealed that about 70 per cent of the total illegal drugs smuggled into India come through the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, posing a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies.Golden Triangle’s grip: Myanmar’s illicit trade dominance unveiledThe Golden Triangle on India’s North East border, shares boundaries with Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, proving to be a hotbed for drug trafficking. Myanmar, the world’s second-largest illicit supplier of morphine and heroin, contributes to 80 per cent of the global heroin supply, smuggled into the US, UK, China, and India via sea routes and other covert paths.“Guwahati and Dimapur have become hotspots for significant heroin seizures, originating from the Golden Triangle. Myanmar’s heroin and meth infiltrate India at two key entry points: Moreh in Manipur and Champhai in Mizoram,” a senior police officer told IANS.Dark web’s influence : A modern twist to an age-old tradeIn a fascinating turn, precursor chemicals like ephedrine, acetic anhydride, and pseudoephedrine are sourced from South India, transported to Kolkata and Guwahati via Delhi, and then smuggled across the border to Myanmar, exploiting domestic security gaps.Indian authorities have ramped up efforts to curb drug trafficking in the region, with a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Governments of India and Myanmar in 2020.The NCB’s 2022 report identifies heroin as the most trafficked drug through the sea route, with ATS, marijuana, cocaine, and others also falling into the net of law enforcement authorities.Syndicates have adapted, using couriers, parcels, and postal services to smuggle and deliver drugs, directly linked to the surge in dark web activity in India. The quantity of drugs in parcels is limited to a few grams to avoid suspicion and interception by law enforcement agencies.Ongoing battle : Multi-pronged approach needed, says expert !Efforts to combat drug trafficking have been ongoing for years, with the Indian Government and international organisations collaborating to disrupt drug trafficking networks. Measures include drug interdiction operations, improving border security, and providing drug treatment and rehabilitation services.Yet, despite these efforts, the drug trade in these regions continues to thrive, with traffickers being privy to law enforcement strategies and finding new methods to smuggle drugs.“There is a need for a multi-pronged approach that not only focuses on law enforcement but also addresses the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to drug production and trafficking,” emphasises Gurmeet Nehra, a research scholar at the Indian Law Institute.                  IANS"

BANGKOK-NEW-DELHI-Jan-30-For-the-first-time-since-Myanmar-s-2021-military-coup-the-junta-has-sent-a-senio,"BANGKOK/ NEW DELHI, Jan 30For the first time since Myanmar’s 2021 military coup, the junta has sent a senior official to take part in an Asean Foreign Ministers’ meeting. Instead of sitting out the Asean Foreign Ministers’ Retreat on Jan 29 because the bloc had barred it from sending a political appointee, the junta dispatched the permanent secretary of the foreign ministry under its control.Few expect the junta’s climbdown on Jan 29 to expand any time soon to dialogue that will end the spiralling humanitarian crisis. But the balance of power in Myanmar is slowly shifting, leaving Myanmar’s neighbours grappling with good ways to hedge their bets against an embattled junta.For now, no country looks better placed than China. “Operation 1027”, launched by the Three Bro-therhood Alliance of ethnic armed groups in October 2023, toppled junta control in at least 17 towns in northern Shan State near the Chinese border and resulted in the mass surrender of over 2,000 junta soldiers as well as six Brigadier Generals. Notably, the alliance made a show of clearing out the online scam operations that Beijing had been appealing to the junta to root out – but to no avail.Beijing flexed its influence by brokering a cease- fire on Jan 12 that essentially cemented these new territorial positions. Under the “Haigeng Agreement” inked in the Chinese city of Kunming, both sides agreed not to attack each other’s positions, as well as to avoid harming Chinese nationals or destroying Chinese investments in Myanmar.“The new status quo was consolidated in writing, in the ceasefire agreement in Kunming,” Ms Yun Sun, director of the China Programme at Stimson Centre, a United States-based think-tank, told The Straits Times. “That means the Chinese are pleased with the status quo.”It remains to be seen if this ceasefire will hold, as other armed groups not party to the agreement have tried to capitalise on the momentum to topple the junta elsewhere in the country.But China is continuing work along the China-Myanmar Economic Corri- dor, including surveys for the future railway that will link Yunnan to the Chinese-backed port project in Myanmar’s Kyaukphyu, along the coast of the Bay of Bengal that opens to the Indian Ocean.Ms Sun thinks that all parties will try to avoid damaging Chinese interests even if fighting intensifies.“I don’t think we should underestimate how much influence China has in that region or in that area. Any group that targets the Chinese projects will face mounting pressure and tremendous pressure in its future survival,” she said.Over in India, the fallout from Operation 1027 has prompted a rethink among the establishment, with many arguing that the Myanmar junta is in no position to defend India’s interests and calling for New Delhi to instead support resistance forces more actively.“Because the junta is not in a position to ensure political stability, it is also not going to be able to provide the social and economic fertile ground needed for foreign investment and projects to go ahead in Myanmar,” said Mr Angshuman Choudhury, an associate fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think-tank.“In that sense, the junta is a volatile partner, which is not good news for any country wanting to invest in Myanmar.”India’s interests in Myan-mar include its geostrategic investments, such as the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project connecting the eastern Indian seaport of Kolkata with Sittwe seaport in Myanmar’s Rakhine state – key components of the Government’s wider strategic outreach to South-east Asia.Other key interests are India’s desire to limit China’s influence in the region and ensure militant groups that target India in the north-east do not use Myanmar as a sanctuary. According to Mr Choudhury, these goals have floundered since the coup as key territories with Indian interests and investment – such as Khampat on the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway – fell under rebel control, and China steals a march over India with its more proactive engagement with resistance forces.Thousands of Myanmar people have also sought refuge in India, and New Delhi has accused Myanmar-based groups of crossing the porous border to mount attacks in its territory and smuggling contraband goods. This has prompted New Delhi to recently announce that it would fence the Indian-Myanmar border and potentially end an arrangement that allows liberal cross-border movement of locals in that vicinity.While it will not be easy for New Delhi to move away from its almost singular reliance on the junta, with which it has developed strategic links, Mr Choudhury says it should ramp up engagement with Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government (NUG) “at the highest level”, which would also enable it to reach out to armed resistance groups under the NUG’s control.The role of Thailand, another of Myanmar’s neighbours, is similarly ripe for a rethink. Thailand has received many appeals to create a humanitarian corridor since the coup. The new government under the Pheu Thai Party has recently pledged to establish a centre for humanitarian aid by the border – though it seems to have engaged only with the junta or junta-controlled agencies. The NUG says it has not been contacted about these plans.Thailand has in the past been accused of neutralising Asean’s efforts by holding its own ministerial meetings with the Myanmar junta. Critics had attributed this to the strong military ties between the two countries.The new Thai government is expected to tread carefully on this, if only because there appears to be a dearth of fresh ideas on how to move ahead, said Dr Surachanee Sriyai, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.She told ST: “There won’t be a drastic upside-down development in terms of Thailand’s approach to Myanmar with the Pheu Thai Party administration.“The status quo will remain for the most part, but Thailand now understands that deviating from Asean principles is damaging to its international reputation. So, no secret ministerial meetings – yet.” The Straits Times"

Things-do-not-look-good-at-all-Everyone-knows-this-but-the-question-of-greater-importance-is-whether-things,"Things do not look good at all. Everyone knows this, but the question of greater importance is whether things will get worse than what it is already or whether Manipur will get to see better days with the passage of time. No easy answer at the moment, but these are questions which must have haunted the psyche of everyone who stands by the understanding of Manipur as a distinct geo-political reality. Many may see the January 24 meeting at Kangla with 36 Meitei MLAs in full attendance, plus two MPs, including the Rajya Sabha MP, as the starting point towards a new beginning, but much will depend on how New Delhi responds to the charter of points put up. This is where Manipur would need to play its card well and while the points agreed and to which the Meitei MLAs have appended their signatures have already been put up before the three member officials deputed by the Union Home Ministry, it still remains to be seen how Delhi responds. This is where Imphal would need to put on its best political foot forward, try and see how it can take forward the stand of the people from a position of strength and in the process ring out the message this is the best route towards putting Manipur on the road to normalcy. The interests of Manipur-this is what should be guarded and promoted at all cost and any idea or proposal that can and will erode the understanding of Manipur should not be entertained at all. The conflict has raged on for over 8 months and for the place and her people to start walking the road to normalcy certain points should be given primacy. This is where the suggestions put forward by the right wing print magazine and news portal Swarajya should give an insight on what is worth exploring and accordingly take up steps to soothe the wounds of Manipur. Update the National Register of Citizens with the base year at 1951, a point which has already been submitted to the Central team on the day of their arrival on January 22. Such a move can and should go a long in addressing the demand to weed out illegal immigrants from Manipur and a look at the newly established settlements, the abnormal spike in the number of population of the Kuki-Chin community which in turn has led to an increase in the number of legislators they get to send to the State Assembly should underline the need for NRC. The call to update the NRC should also be seen in conjunction with the demand raised to delist the Kukis from the Scheduled Tribe list of the Constitution of India. The representation to the Central team as well as the points of agreement reached during the Kangla meeting on January 24 did not specifically say anything about including the Meiteis in the ST list of the Constitution, but this is a demand which has caught the imagination of the Meitei people and not without reason. This is another point which has been prominently raised in Swarajya.It should be clear to New Delhi and the people in general that the tension seen at Churachandpur and other Kuki dominated places such as Moreh and Kangpokpi was seen and understood as a stand off between the people of Churachandpur and the State Government. Never was it read or understood along the line of Meitei versus Kuki in Imphal and the valley districts. It was only when Meitei houses were identified, targeted and razed to the ground at Torbung and later at Churachandpur that Imphal and the valley districts reacted violently. This is a reality which should not be lost on the political mandarins at New Delhi. The demand that the Suspension of Operation pact with the Kuki militants be abrogated should be seen with the merit it deserves. The narrative of volunteers defending their villages was a lie from the very beginning and the series of attacks launched on the State security personnel at Moreh from the end of December till the first many days of January 2024 should more than underline the involvement of well trained militants. Time for Delhi to act. Abrogate SoO, update the NRC and while these are points for New Delhi to act on, for Imphal it is imperative that the sought after report to include the Meiteis in the ST list be forwarded."

Monetary-benefits-given-to-900-fish-farmers,"Imphal, Dec 22 (DIPR)The Chief Minister today transferred Rs 15,000 each to the bank accounts of 900 fish farmers of 10 hill districts. The assistance was provided under Paddy cum Pisciculture scheme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR) for the year 2019-2020.A solemn function to mark the occasion was organised by the Directorate of Fisheries at the Durbar Hall of Chief Minister’s Secretariat.Speaking at the occasion, the Chief Minister said that Manipur requires 52,000 MT of fish every year. However, Manipur could produce only 27,000 MT till the present Government came to power and thus Rs 400 crore was required to import the remaining quantity every year, he said.As such, the Government started focusing on enhancement of fish production, he said and added that apart from commissioning of a fish-feed production unit, the State Government has arranged loans ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 7 lakh for hundreds of fish farmers. As a result, the State's current fish production per year has increased to 32,600 MT per year, the Chief Minister said.The Chief Minister said that the State Government sent a proposal of Rs 14 crore to implement Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana to the Centre, out of which Rs 7.04 crore has already been sanctioned.Moreover, the State Government is planning to submit an ambitious project worth Rs 400 crore in consultation with the Central Agricultural University, he informed. In the meantime, cage culture under Loktak Livelihood Mission and fish production through Biofloc system are also going on in full swing. The Government is ready to provide assistance through bank loans, Manipur StartUp and StandUp schemes to accomplish the objective of making Manipur self-sufficient in fish production, the Chief Minister said.In his speech, Fisheries Minister  S Rajen said that the State Government has been trying its best to maintain accountability and provide good governance to the people. It was a part of the effort that monetary assistance was disbursed through DBT, the Minister said.He also exhorted the people to extend cooperation to the Government in making Manipur a self-reliant State.The main objective of implementing Paddy cum Pisciculture is to double the farmers’ income from the same field through fish rearing, development of these paddy fields by raising peripheral rings and constructing feeding channels across the paddy field with small marketing ponds for paddy cum pisciculture. The scheme also aims to encourage and inculcate the interest of farmers to fish culture.The present scheme is to develop 450 hectare of paddy field in 5 hills districts of Manipur with a total Government subsidy at the rate of 25% to the total unit cost of Rs 1.60 lakh per hectare.The Government has released a sum of Rs 1.80 crore with a sharing pattern at 90:10 between the Centre and the State. And each beneficiary having an area of 0.5 hectare will get a subsidy amount of Rs 20,000 which will be given in two parts. Rs 15000 will be transferred through PFMS and the rest Rs 5000 will be given in the form of fish seed, he said.Additional Chief Secretary (Fishery) MH Khan, Director (Fishery) N Gojendro Singh and bank officials also attended the function."
Naga-organisations-petition-PM-to-intervene,"Newmai News NetworkSENAPATI, Jul 24 : Naga organisations of Manipur have petitioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to intervene and put the Naga peace process on the “right track”. They also expressed serious concerns on the recent happenings including the killings of 6 NSCN-IM cadres in Arunachal Pradesh by the security forces.United Naga Council (UNC), Naga Women Union (NWU), Naga People’s Movement for Human Rights-South (NPMHR-S) and All Naga Students’ Association, Manipur (ANSAM), in a joint memorandum to the Prime Minister of India, said that Government of India’s Interlocutor for Naga peace talks, RN Ravi, had the best opportunity of winning the hearts and minds of the Naga people after the Framework Agreement was signed but that did not happen.“After the Framework Agreement was signed, the Interlocutor Mr. RN Ravi had the best opportunity of winning the hearts and minds of Naga people. Nagas believed him and appreciated his accessibility and pragmatic approach. But the present trend of talk seems to be going out of track,” the memorandum also said.The four Naga organisations said that they were petitioning even at this time of “unprecedented crisis” due to COVID-19, and expressed their immense appreciation to the Prime Minister for his “dynamic leadership in handling the COVID-19 pandemic”. However, “with a grave sense of urgency and apprehension on the manner in which the Indo-Naga political dialogue is being conducted, we request your personal intervention to put the peace process on the right track in resolving one of the longest political issues in the Indian sub-continent,” the joint memorandum added.The four Naga organisations pointed out in their joint memorandum that the “3rd of August 2020 will be the 5th anniversary of the Framework Agreement” and when the Framework Agreement was signed in 2015 it gave the Nagas a high hope and “we believed that the Government of India under your able leadership was ushering in a new paradigm shift and historic changes towards a logical roadmap for the final settlement of the Indo-Naga issue.It then said that  5 years have gone and the Framework Agreement is in peril of being reduced to a mere document. “We feel the letter and spirit of the Framework Agreement and your vision for a peaceful and honourable political settlement with the Nagas are not visible in the Government of India’s representative at the negotiation table. This impression has led the Nagas to doubt the sincerity of the Government of India,” it added.The memorandum said that, recently, RN Ravi’s letter to the Chief Minister of Nagaland had termed the “aged-old Naga National Organisations” as “armed gangs” with whom he has been in talks on behalf of the Government of India. “Mr. Ravi has ostentatiously begun to bulldoze the Indo-Naga political issue as a mere law and order problem. The trust and confidence built up over the course of the dialogue process has now been decimated,” the memorandum added.“There have been rampant raids, the arrest and seizures by Indian army and remand to NIA custody of public leaders, businessmen and members of Naga National Organisations,” added the memorandum.The “recent gunning down of 6 NSCN cadres mercilessly in Longding district of Arunachal Pradesh on July 11, 2020 is again a clear proof of blatant provocation by the Indian security forces,” it alleged.The memorandum urged the Prime Minister for his personal intervention to take the talks to a logical conclusion to prevent further escalation of unwanted situation."

This year, the lack of rainfall led to almost 50 percent of the agricultural lands being rendered useless and unproductive. This is due to global warming and climate change. However, positive change needs the effort of all the NGOs, organisations and the people, not just the Government, he added.On the other hand, CAF&PD Minister Karam Shyam said that humans are the main culprit behind the degrading condition of the planet as the number of people who actually realises their role in conservation of the planet is quite low and stressed on the importance of spreading awareness to the youths and the students.Conservation and protection of wildlife and the earth requires the concentrated efforts of all the social activists, voluntary organisations, youths etc, he added.He continued that global warming has now reached Manipur and added that even if the Forest Department sends message and awareness through radio, TV and media etc, the people do not seem to give too much importance to this pressing matter."

Plastic wastes are also common in every nook and corner and on road sides.Nonetheless, some people are often seen bringing their own bags while coming for shopping things.Speaking to The Sangai Express, one of the women vegetable vendors of the Khwairamband market said that half kg, one kg and two kg plastic bags are the most circulated ones, as they are being used up at the rate of around 2-3 packets every day.She mentioned that even if there is a ban on plastics, they are easily available and explained that the jute bags or degradable bags supplied by the Government costs around Rs 2 per piece which is not every economical when selling vegetables for a small sum of Rs 5-10.This is one of the main reasons why women vendors, most of whom are poor, are dependant on plastic bags, she reasoned.However, this does not mean that plastic use has not been discouraged in all shops.  Some shops have started using paper bags for small items, apart from providing bags made of cloth if the customers buy a large number of items."
Politics-of-silence-Playing-the-card-close-to-its-chest-Not-surprising-for-the-coming-Lok-Sabha-election-wil,"Politics of silence. Playing the card close to its chest. Not surprising for the coming Lok Sabha election will be crucial though it may mean different things to the Big 2, the BJP and the Congress. This is particularly so for the Inner Parliamentary Constituency. To the BJP the election will be a sort of the people’s response or referendum on how it has dealt with the ongoing crisis while to the Congress it would mean stepping in to fill the void and make up for the ‘failure’ of the BJP Government to bring the situation under control. This is precisely the reason why the coming Lok Sabha elections has generated so much interests amongst the people, more so amongst the discerning folks of the land. Even as debates and discussions on the coming Parliamentary elections have started doing the round, one can broadly detect the emergence of three distinct groups of people. One is the discerning lot-the folks who have taken a more than keen interest studying the antecedents, the potential and the conduct of the intending candidates not only from the BJP and Congress but also other political parties, the second is the ‘neither here nor there’ lot-the group which will go along with the political turns and twists and the third group is the sceptical lot-the folks who will vote but with the ‘perceived knowledge’ that nothing much can be expected from the elected folks. The stand of the last group of people can be understood in the backdrop of the fact that so far no elected MP from here have been able to present the case of Manipur forcefully and effectively on the floor of Parliament and elsewhere, particularly at the height of the ethnic violence here. This is about the demeanour of the last group of people and contrast it with the keen interest shown by the first group of people and here is an example of how and why Manipur has continued to exist as a geo-political reality all these years. The important question is whether this group of concerned folks will make any difference to the outcome of the elections. It is the second group which can play spoilsport to the ideals of the first group and remember the majority always seem to fall within the understanding of the second group. A group of people who refuse to study and acknowledge the reality but who nonetheless have immense lung and muscle power and outshout anyone to have their way through and it is this which Manipur sees regularly being staged on the roads and streets of Imphal and other places.It is the broad categorisation of the three groups of voters that the different political parties, particularly the big 2-the BJP and the Congress-will have to contend with while deciding on their candidate. No names have been announced as of yet officially, but already names are doing the round and this is where one can definitely see the politics being played in making certain names as probable candidates go viral on the social media. It has even extended to that stage that some stories come uncomfortably close to the understanding of ‘planted news’ to confuse the people and influence the choice of candidates. The politics of names or intending candidates and the longer the BJP and the Congress put off officially announcing their respective list of candidates, the more room will be created to float names and more names and in the process create more confusion. The stake for the two political parties is big, no doubt about that, but it should be bigger for the voters and the place. Ultimately it will boil down to the question of whether the people have learnt any lessons from the past Lok Sabha elections and 2024 is the best time to demonstrate that some lessons have indeed been learnt. What should not be forgotten is the fact that in pushing the button on the Electronic Voting Machine on D day, it is not only the fate of the candidates which will be sealed but will have a huge bearing on the fate of the people and the place at least for the next five years. Voting should also be a referendum on the Government particularly on how it has dealt with the present situation. This is the time for the people to show their authority and how they show it will tell whether any lessons have been learnt from the past 10 months or not."

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma was also present.Terming it as a “golden day” for the people of Assam, Home Minister Amit Shah said the State has suffered for long due to violence by ULFA and around 10,000 people have lost their lives since 1979.He further announced that a major development package will be given to Assam under the agreement with ULFA and assured that the accord will be implemented fully.“It is a matter of great joy for me that today is a golden day for Assam’s future. Assam has suffered from violence since a long time. Since Narendra Modi became the PM, efforts were made to shorten the gap between Delhi and North East. In the last five years, 9 peace and border-related agreements have been signed across North East, because of which peace has been established in major part of the region,” he said.He added that the ULFA has agreed to abjure violence and disband the organisation.Two top leaders of the Rajkhowa group have been in the National Capital since last week.According to PTI, the outfit’s general secretary, Anup Chetia, held talks with peace interlocutor AK Mishra on Tuesday. Along with Mishra, who is the Government’s adviser on North East affairs, Intelligence Bureau’s Director Tapan Deka was part of the talks with the group.ULFA, a separatist outfit, was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 youngsters from Upper Assam districts to wage an armed struggle for an independent Assam.The group had expressed willingness for talks on several occasions but had been firm on its stand on ‘sovereignty’.During the Assembly election campaigns in Tripura, Meghalaya, and Nagaland earlier this year, the BJP emphasised the decline in militancy and the relative peace in the North East since the Narendra Modi Government came to power in 2014. Last month, Amit Shah announced the signing of a peace agreement with the Pambei led United National Liberation Front (UNLF) in Manipur.And, now the ULFA accord will only bolster the party’s narrative.The Indian Express"

GAZA-Jan-14Israel-will-pursue-its-war-against-Hamas-until-victory-and-will-not-be-stopped-by-anyone-includ,"GAZA, Jan 14Israel will pursue its war against Hamas until victory and will not be stopped by anyone, including the world court, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a defiant speech on Saturday, as the fighting in Gaza approached the 100-day mark.Netanyahu spoke after the International Court of Justice at The Hague held two days of hearings on South Africa’s allegations that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, a charge Israel has rejected as libelous and hypocritical. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its blistering air and ground offensive in an interim step.“No one will stop us, not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anyone else,” Netanyahu said in televised remarks on Saturday evening, referring to Iran and its allied militias.The case before the world court is expected to go on for years but a ruling on interim steps could come within weeks. Court rulings are binding but difficult to enforce. Netanyahu made clear that Israel would ignore orders to halt the fighting, potentially deepening its isolation.Israel has been under growing international pressure to end the war, which has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led to widespread suffering in the besieged enclave but has so far been shielded by US diplomatic and military support.Israel argues that ending the war means victory for Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 and is bent on Israel’s destruction.The war was triggered by a deadly October 7 attack in which Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians. About 250 more were taken hostage, and while some have been released or confirmed dead, more than half are believed to still be in captivity. Sunday marks 100 days of fighting.Fears of a wider conflagration have been palpable since the start of the war. New fronts quickly opened, with Iran-backed groups — Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria — carrying out a range of attacks. From the start, the US increased its military presence in the region to deter an escalation.Following a Houthi campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, the US and Britain launched multiple airstrikes against the rebels on Friday, and the US hit another site Saturday.In more fallout from the war, the world court this week heard arguments on South Africa’s complaint against Israel. South Africa cited the soaring death toll and hardships among Gaza civilians, along with inflammatory comments from Israeli leaders presented, as proof of what it called genocidal intent.In counter arguments on Friday, Israel asked for the case to be dismissed as meritless.Netanyahu and his army chief, Herzl Halevi, said they have no immediate plans to allow the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, the initial focus of Israel’s offensive.Netanyahu said the issue had been raised by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit earlier this week. The Israeli leader said he told Blinken that “we will not return residents (to their homes) when there is fighting”.At the same time, Netanyahu said Israel would eventually need to close what he said were breaches along Gaza’s border with Egypt.However, the border area, particularly the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, is packed with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza, and their presence would complicate any plans to widen Israel’s ground offensive.“We will not end the war until we close this breach,” Netanyahu said on Saturday, adding that the government has not yet decided how to do that.In Gaza, where Hamas has put up stiff resistance to Israel’s blistering air and ground campaign, the war continued unabated.The Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday that 135 Palestinians had been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall toll of the war to 23,843. The count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians, but the ministry has said about two-thirds of the dead are women and children. The ministry said the total number of war-wounded surpassed 60,000.Since the start of Israel’s ground operation in late October, 187 Israeli soldiers have been killed and another 1,099 injured in Gaza, according to the military.More than 85 per cent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced as a result of Israel’s air and ground offensive, and vast swathes of the territory have been levelled.Only 15 of the territory’s 36 hospitals are still partially functional, according to OCHA, the United Nations’ humanitarian affairs agency.Amid already severe shortages of food, clean water and fuel in Gaza, OCHA said in its daily report that Israel’s severe constraints on humanitarian missions and outright denials had increased since the start of the year.The agency said only 21 per cent of planned deliveries of food, medicine, water and other supplies have been successfully reaching northern Gaza. American and other international efforts pushing Israel to do more to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians have met with little success. AP"

""Call someone to come get me, please.""But after more than two weeks of frantic efforts to reach her, Hind's body was recovered on Saturday, alongside relatives and two PRCS rescue workers sent to find her.The aid agency and the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip confirmed the grim discovery, and blamed Israeli forces.The Palestinian group Hamas urged human rights groups and the international community to document what it called a ""horrific crime"".Hind's highly publicised case comes as aid agencies warn that children and families are bearing the brunt of Israel's war with Hamas.Children are dying ""at an alarming rate"" in Gaza, the UN children's agency UNICEF said.Thousands have been killed and many more injured, with others at risk because of lack of food, water and medicine, the UN children's agency UNICEF said.Hind was last heard from after becoming trapped in the family's vehicle with other relatives as they tried to flee Gaza City from an Israel advance.""Hind and everyone else in the car is martyred,"" the girl's grandfather, Baha Hamada, told AFP on Saturday.A number of family members found them when they went to Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa area looking for the car near a petrol station where it had last been spotted, he said.""They were able to reach the area because Israeli forces withdrew early at dawn today,"" added Hamada, one of the last people to speak to the girl on the telephone.""She was killed by (Israeli) occupation forces with all those who were with her in the car outside the petrol station in Tel al-Hawa,"" the ministry said in a statement.The Palestine Red Crescent said that the Israeli military ""deliberately targeted the ambulance upon its arrival at the scene"" despite ""prior coordination"" allowing it through.Earlier this week, family members had said the group found their way in the path of Israeli tanks and were fired on as they tried to flee.- 'She was terrified' -Hind initially survived the shooting and managed to talk to her family by telephone and make an emergency call, which the PRCS published on February 3.""For over three hours, Hind desperately pleaded for rescue from the occupation (Israeli) tanks surrounding her, enduring gunfire and the horror of being alone, trapped among the bodies of her relatives shot by the Israeli forces in front of her eyes,"" it added.Nothing more was then heard from the young girl, even as the ambulance was sent to get her, the organisation said. Her grandfather said she was injured in the back, hand and foot.""She was frightened, terrified,"" he told AFP, sobbing.""Hind is my first grandchild, she's a piece of my heart.""There was no comment from the Israeli army when contacted by AFP.The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive in Gaza that the health ministry says has killed at least 27,947 people, mostly women and children.UNICEF said on Wednesday that children in Gaza need ""life-saving support"" as the hostilities were having a ""catastrophic impact"".Half of the estimated 1.7 million people displaced in Gaza are children.

Guwahati-Jan-4-Mizoram-Chief-Minister-Lalduhoma-told-Minister-of-External-Affairs-S-Jaishankar-that-any-mov,"Guwahati, Jan 4Mizoram Chief Minister Lalduhoma told Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar that any move to fence the Indo-Myanmar border was ""unacceptable"".""The British had separated the Mizos by carving out Burma from India. They divided the Mizo ethnic people's land from the ancient days into two parts. That is why we cannot accept the border, instead we always dream of becoming a Nation under one administration,"" Lalduhoma told Jaishankar in their first meeting in New Delhi after becoming the CM, on Wednesday evening.The Mizoram CM further said that any move to fence the border would approve the border created by the British dividing the ethnic Mizos. ""It shall be unacceptable for us,"" Lalduhoma said.This comes days after MHA officials told a section of media that the Ministry was planning to fence 300 km of unfenced stretches of the border with Myanmar.They said MHA was also going to end the Free Movement Regime (FMR), which allows ethnic people living on both sides of the border to travel within 16 kms (both sides) without a Visa. They will now require a visa, the officials said.India shares 1,643 kms of border with Myanmar.The FMR was introduced in the 1970s as ethnic tribes living in Myanmar and India share ethnic and familial ties and they wanted a system for easy movement. They now just require a travel pass issued by the border guarding force (Assam Rifles) to cross the border.Manipur appealBut after the violence between Meiteis and Kukis broke out in Manipur, CM N Biren Singh urged the Centre to cancel the FMR saying insurgents and drug smugglers were misusing the system to carry on with ""anti-India activities"".Kukis share ethnic ties with the Mizos of Mizoram and Chins of Myanmar.The Kuki-Zos have, in fact, stepped up their demand for ""unification"" of the Zofate (Kuki-Zo-Chins) living in India and Myanmar for creation of a ""separate administration"" in order to end the conflict.Former CM Zoramthanga also publicly extended support to the demand for ""unification"" of the Zofate. Laldhuhoma's party, Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), which formed its first Government in Mizoram by defeating Mizo National Front recently, also promised ""unification"" of the Zofate in its poll manifesto.Mizoram has provided shelters to nearly 40,000 Chin ""refugees"" from Myanmar since the military had taken over the elected Government in 2021 and launched a crackdown against the ""prodemocracy protesters"".Lalduhoma also discussed the issues related to Myanmar refugees, said an official statement issued by Mizoram government.Deccan Herald"
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-2-Keishamthong-AC-MLA-Nishikant-Singh-Sapam-has-asserted-that-an,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 2: Keishamthong AC MLA Nishikant Singh Sapam has asserted that an Inner Line Permit (ILP) app should be incorporated in the Tourism Department’s website and licences should be given to hotels for opening liquor bars in order to attract tourists to the State.The Independent MLA made this observation while discussing a demand for grant pertaining to Tourism in the State Assembly today.Nishikant said that very few people built beautiful buildings/houses in Manipur till the early 1990s and there were very few vehicles. People could easily identify any non-Government vehicle moving on the road.The law and order situation was so bad that no non-local officers wanted to get posted in Manipur. Even Manipuri officers preferred posting outside the State, he said.But today, the number of vehicles seen on the roads of Manipur is so large and traffic jams have become quite common on the roads of Imphal, Nishikant said.At that time very few tourists came to the State. Of all the non-local people who came to the State for different purposes, very few of them visited Loktak and some other places and went back the next day, he said.Now many tourism sites have been developed in the State. Recently, a Polo statue was inaugurated atop Marjing hill under the initiative of the Chief Minister. There is an Olympian Park at Sangaithel and also Ethnic Park at Moirang Khunou, he noted.For Manipur, tourism is one sector which can generate the highest income. If tourism can thrive as an industry, all the people of Manipur would be benefited directly or indirectly. All sections of people including taxi drivers, hoteliers and farmers would be benefited once Manipur becomes a popular tourism destination, he asserted.Of late, Manipur has been witnessing substantial rise in the number of tourists visiting the State. Lakhs visited Manipur during the recent Manipur Sangai Festival.Going by the number of tourists who visited Manipur during the Sangai Festival, it is estimated that around 15 to 20 lakh tourists might visit the State in a year.If these 15/20 lakh tourists buy just memento each, it would turn out to be a big boost to the State memento producers, he said.Observing that there are now many tourist spots in the State,  Nishikant said that people need to be friendly and hospitable toward all tourists.Local people of well known tourism destinations like Goa, Sikkim and Indonesia’s Bali are very friendly to tourists.“Manipuri people are also friendly to tourists but we need to treat them with the spirit of Guest is God”, he said.He also highlighted the importance of making all ILP related matters accessible through websites and other digital platforms. The ILP app should be incorporated in the Manipur Tourism’s website.All tour operators, both based in Manipur and outside, should be given all the details of ILP in advance. Only payment of ILP fees should be introduced.The app should be designed in such a way that the Government can easily know how long and where a tourist may stay in Manipur, he said.Nishikant said that he adopted a second home of Sangai at Iroishemba Zoological Garden with a view to enable tourists take a look at the State animal which is also an endangered species even if tourists cannot see the animal at Keibul Lamjao National Park.Just saying that Kangla is a historical place of Manipur is not enough. Guides who have thorough knowledge of the history of Manipur should be stationed at Kangla in order to give detailed information about Kangla to tourists, he continued.Tourists should be made comfortable when they visit the State. Most tourists love to drink and dine when they visit some exotic places.As such, there is a need to issue licences to hotels for opening liquor bars, specially for tourists. All efforts should be made to ensure that all tourists have fond and exciting memories of Manipur after they go back to their home countries/States, he said. Legalisation of liquor at hotels is already in the pipeline, he added."
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-19-Taking-strong-exception-to-the-repeated-intimidations-of-its-intending,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 19 : Taking strong exception to the repeated intimidations of its intending candidate in the Lok Sabha election in Outer Parliamentary seat, the Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has said that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should take the matter seriously and defer the election if necessary.Speaking to the media at Congress Bhavan today, MPCC president K Meghachandra asked whether the Lok Sabha election at this point of time would be peaceful in Manipur.Urging the ECI to ensure the safety of its intending candidate Alfred K Arthur, he added that it would be better to defer the election if the democratic exercise cannot be held in a free and fair manner.Firing multiple rounds twice in less than 24 hours to intimidate the intending candidate of the party  is a matter of grave concern, he said while adding that the election should be held as per the guidelines of the Indian Constitution and no room should be given to intimidate the voters and the candidates.If an election is to be held, let it be done peacefully and allow people to choose their representative democratically, Meghachandra said."
Prof-Saroj-Sharma-Chairperson-NIOS-and-Dr-Sunita-J-Kathuria-Consultant-Reasearch-and-Evaluation-NIOSA-si,"Prof Saroj Sharma Chairperson, NIOS and Dr Sunita J Kathuria Consultant (Reasearch and Evaluation), NIOSA significant number of children who prepare for their exams, particularly the board exams, experience anxiety and stress related to their academic performance, which leads to a variety of mental and physical health problems. Children frequently feel pressure to live up to the expectations placed on them by parents and family, teachers and school system, peer group, media, and community at large. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between supportive interventions and academic expectations in order to help children overcome the challenges of exams.The research studies conducted to assess the measure of stress and anxiety revealed that students report physical discomfort, including headaches, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, stomach aches, abdominal pain, muscle tension, backaches, constant fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances, and cognitive effects. The board students are vulnerable to stress and anxiety as they are at a significant period of physical and emotional transformation. The studies mention that chronic stress has been linked to alter brain structure and function, including reduced executive and memory function and elevated anxiety and depression. These alterations may persist for years and affect one’s ability to succeed in school and the workplace in the future.Teachers and parents: Time to calm down and planAs we take a closer look at “exam stress”, the two most important people in a child’s life are their parents and teachers.Open communication, providing emotional support, promoting positive mindset, validating child’s feelings, identifying triggers, teaching relaxation techniques, encouraging physical activity and healthy habits, providing assurance and re-assurance, teaching stress management, encourage expression are some of the ways to deal with the exam stress. By removing uncertainty and offering clear expectations and study materials, teachers can help students feel more prepared and confident. Teachers can incorporate stress-reduction strategies into the curriculum by instructing students in mindfulness and relaxation techniques that they can practice on difficult days.A caring and supportive home environment is just as important in assisting in overcoming the challenges and stress of exams. It entails offering assistance, inspiration, and understanding while upholding a sensible equilibrium between the student’s wellbeing and academic expectation. Mindful parenting includes supporting, understanding, and being there for your child as they navigate the pressures and challenges of exams.“Inform your child that no matter how they do in their exam, you are always here for them” is something very important.Allow your kids to express their emotions and discuss exams without criticizing them. They should not be burdened with excessive demands for excellence. Help them in creating a study schedule that includes breaks and downtime. As a parent, give helpful support, such as a quiet study space, healthy snacks, and the necessary study materials. It is important to teach kids self-care and relaxation skills, such as deep breathing exercises, short walks, and calming music. Further while it is important to be involved, parents should not micromanage kid’s study regimen. Allow them to handle their own schedules and responsibilities with a certain amount of autonomy and responsibility. Acknowledge small successes and important turning points in the exam-taking process instead of concentrating only on the final results.Celebrate efforts, not just resultsEncourage an attitude that places learning and growth ahead of merely achieving high grades. Whenever a child has difficulties, remind him or her of their past successes and assets and maintain a positive outlook and believe in your child’s abilities.Role of other stakeholders in mitigating exam stressCollaboration between multiple stakeholders who each have a unique role to play in supporting students’ well-being is necessary to address the stress that children experience during exams. Developing procedures and policies that promote students’ general wellbeing is the responsibility of school administrators. In addition to making sure that academic standards are reasonable, they can put stress-reduction strategies into action and foster a positive school climate. Not only the school system, media can help by supporting initiatives that promote healthy learning habits, offering educational resources, and encouraging positive and balanced portrayals of academic success.NEP (2020) and mental health of studentsThe National Education Policy (NEP, 2020) addressed the concern of mental health of students through various recommendations for different stakeholders. To address students’ mental health needs, the policy suggests offering counseling services and support networks within schools. It acknowledges the value of psychological and emotional support in the classroom.Given the gravity of these emotions, it’s critical to act quickly to obtain assistance. In such a situation, we must understand that ‘asking for help is a show of strength’ and there exists various ways to deal with stress and mental health issues. Helpline, crisis intervention services, and mental health specialists are readily accessible to provide assistance and direction in numerous Nations. A certain amount of stress is actually thought to be helpful and beneficial. Children are aided in making appropriate preparations as a result, but when it gets out of control, it can have terrible consequences. Many children figure out how to handle the stress of tests on their own—making a schedule, talking to friends, studying more, watching TV, participating in extracurricular activities, talking to parents or other adults, working out, etc—some children require more support and guidance than others. But, if required, it is always suggested to get help from a mental health professional, counselor, or a trustworthy person in your life.Self confidence matters: Every child has a unique potentialIt is always important to keep in mind that every child is different and that certain strategies may or may not work. Hence, it is critical to modify plan in light of child’s unique requirements and character.PIB"

The NNPG is composed of only seven groups while other Naga groups have been left out, he said, announcing that the three groups welcome like-minded organisations to join them for the cause of Nagas.Stating that there is no nomenclature for the three groups who have come together, Akato said they will approach the Centre for political talks. The Naga Political Issue is considered the longest-running insurgency in the country.The Centre has been holding separate negotiations with NSCN-IM since 1997 and the WC NNPGs since 2017.Eight years have passed since the signing of the acclaimed Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015 with NSCN-IM and another six years have gone by following the inking of Agreed Position on November 17, 2017 with WC NNPGs.The NSCN-IM has remained adamant on its demand for a separate flag and constitution for the Nagas as well as integration of Naga-inhabited areas spread over four states of India -- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland, and also Myanmar.

Dhaka-Feb-5At-least-95-Myanmar-border-guards-some-of-them-wounded-have-fled-to-Bangladesh-over-the-last-f,"Dhaka, Feb 5At least 95 Myanmar border guards, some of them wounded, have fled to Bangladesh over the last few days as fighting intensifies between rebel forces in Myanmar and the junta regime, officials in Bangladesh said on Monday.Since mounting a coup against an elected government in 2021, the junta is facing its biggest challenge, trying to contain a bloody rebellion which has seen allied anti-junta groups backed by a pro-democracy parallel government seize control of several military posts and towns.The sound of gunfire could be heard from across the Myanmar border in Bangladesh's southeastern tourist district of Cox's Bazar, where nearly one million members of the Muslim minority from Myanmar live in bamboo-and-plastic hut camps after fleeing a military crackdown there in 2017.Members of the Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) entered Bangladesh with their weapons and 15 of them had bullet wounds when they crossed the border, Shariful Islam, a spokesman for Border Guard Bangladesh, said on Monday, adding that the wounded received treatment at different hospitals.The BGP troops could be accommodated in the nearby district of Bandarban before they are sent back to Myanmar, said Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner based in Cox's Bazar.""I have been asked if the BGP can be sheltered safely in transit camps that were built in Bandarban for repatriating Rohingya refugees. The camps are empty,"" Rahman said.Bullets and mortar shells from across the Myanmar border landed on Bangladesh territory on Monday, killing at least two people, a government official in Cox's Bazar said.""A Bangladeshi woman and a Rohingya were killed and a child injured near the border by a mortar shell fired from Myanmar,"" said Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees.Many residents on the Bangladeshi side of the border have fled to the houses of relatives further away from violence out of fear, he said.Panic has gripped the refugee camps in Myanmar with many waiting to cross over to Bangladesh as supply chains have been cut off due to the ongoing conflict, according to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.""Now and then we hear the sound of gunshots from Myanmar. Some of the Rohingya Muslims want to flee here as they are living in constant fear without basic needs,"" Rohingya refugee Oli Hossain said.""Even we are living in fear because of the sound of gunshots.""

N-Munal-MeiteiInternational-Day-of-Forests-is-celebrated-on-21st-of-March-since-2012-to-increase-public-awar,"N Munal MeiteiInternational Day of Forests is celebrated on 21st of March since 2012 to increase public awareness about the values, significance and contributions of forests for existence of life on the earth.Forest is the lungs of the Earth. Forests are crucial to the future and the planet. Forests are one of our greatest natural treasures that we must preserve and protect for survival of all living beings. This year’s theme, ‘Forests and Innovation’ calls for giving, the critical role that forests play in the world of innovation and vice versa.This day is also a wake-up call for global leaders to take action against climate change. Almost all aspects of our life are related to forests. Sustainable forests management and their resources is the only way to deal with climate change and preserve the future for future generations.Forests cover one third of the Earth’s land mass and perform vital functions around the world giving the resources like the food, fuel, medicines, fodder, essential oils, resins, latex, gums, fiber, water and woods. Almost 28% of world population ie 1.6 billion people-including more than 2000 indigenous cultures-depend on forests for their livelihood. Forests are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems. Forests are home to over 80% of terrestrial biodiversity; including 80% of amphibians, 75% of birds and 68% of mammals. Forests provide habitats for planet’s most iconic species like the tiger, lion, Sangai, giant panda, gorilla and orangutan.Forests provide shelter, jobs and security for forest-dependent communities who themselves protect the forests. Forests play a key role in our battle in adapting to and mitigating climate change. Forests contribute in balancing the oxygen, carbon dioxide, humidity and water cycle. Forests protect watersheds, which supply 75% of freshwater worldwide. Thus, forests provide priceless ecological, economic, social and health services.Forests is source of flora and fauna on the planet. When we drink a glass of water, write in a notebook, take medicine or build a house, we do not remember the inter- connection with forests but in many aspects, our lives are linked to forests. Healthy forests mean healthy, resilient and prosperous live.Forests are the complex living community of the trees which provide home to a big range of animals and the soil beneath it that inhabit variety of inverte- brates, fungi and bacteria playing significant role in balancing the soil nutrients. Data shows that forest loss worldwide is equivalent to an area of 11 football fields per minute which is amoun-ting to 41 million trees per day.Forests are the natural beauty on the earth which need to conserve for an ecological balance. Defores- tation accounts for 16 to 20% of the global greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Every second, forests provide quality and benefits to lives on Earth.Forests have always been crucial to human life and economies and they will become increasingly significant as the global human population grows by another 30% – to 9 billion people–by mid-century. At the same time, our forests will face many threats as a result of unsustainable use. As we move forward, our forests must play a crucial role in supporting the growth of a global green economy.Innovative solutions, to ensure sustainable forest management is the need of the hour. Such policies outline that the forests can be a key part of green economy for an innovative market, both for the public and private sectors in long-term solutions.At the local level, forests benefit us with timber, medicines, fuelwood and ecotourism industry. At the regional level, forests provide ecosystem services such as water regulation, soil stability, flood mitigation and air quality. And at the global level, forests make an important contribution to economic develop- ment, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation including gene pools, pharmaceuticals products etc.Forest absorb 28% of all carbon dioxide released from industries next to ocean. Globally the overall carbon storage of forests constitutes 54% of the 2,200 gigatons of the total carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems. Forests act as massive water pumps through water transpiration. Loss of forest cover linked to environmental tipping points such as drought and insect epidemics and increased natural hazards. Forests help to produce clean water in rivers and streams by reducing sediment loss from watersheds.Non-timber forest products play an important role in the livelihoods of many poor who live in or near forests. The forest sector employs some 10 million people and sustainable forests can meet the future livelihood of many more communities.Forests suffer from multiple market failures for the benefits that they produce and the costs of their destruction in the visible economic terms. The current economic system usually fail to recognize the value of the existing natural forest capital with its potential to provide continuing services and cash flows. Integrating forests into a green economy will require innovative policies and market solutions that are presently not recognized.Human health is inextricably linked to forest health. When we take away the forest, it is not just the trees that go. The entire ecosystem begins to fall apart, with dire consequences for all of us. Meanwhile, time spent in forests has been shown to have a positive benefit on conditions including cardiovascular disease, respiratory concerns, stress, diabetes and mental health.Therefore to protect forests, the green gold, let’s plant more trees-cut your living costs but not trees, eat sustainable food, use the recycled and biodegradable products. Then only we can save the forests and mother earth for the future generations. Environmentalist,[email protected]"

Sir-I-would-like-to-bring-out-the-following-two-inaccurate-statements-in-the-article-Resolving-Kuki-Zo-Chin,"Sir,I would like to bring out the following two inaccurate statements in the article ‘Resolving Kuki-Zo-Chin and Meitei conflict’ by Home Raikhan published in The Sangai Express on 24 July 2023:1. Not being clear on how to proceed with the immigrants, Raja Nara Singh of Manipur handed over the case to the British colonial master for resolution.During the reign of Nara Singh (As regent of the young King Chandrakriti Singh from 1834 to 1844 and thereafter Raja till 1850), Manipur was not under the British Colonial Rule. Major MacCulloch submitted on 18th July 1861, the Memorandum on the duties of a Political Agent of Manipur (Alexander Mackenzie p155-157) which included the following:· A political agent was first appointed for the preservation of a friendly intercourse and as a medium of communication with Manipur and as occasion may require with the Burmese authorities and more specially to prevent border feuds and disturbances which might lead to hostilities between Manipur and Burmese.· In the hills all around the valley, and to the west beyond the Barak and Mookroo, are Kookies over whom I exercise a general superintendence to prevent oppression of the people, driven from their homes by their enemies in the south. The late Rajah of Manipur, Nur Singh, made over the superintendence of all these tribes to me. This arose from the first proceedings in connection with them for the establishment of a line of villages to the south of the Koupooees, a matter which came before the Governor General in Council.2. The tribals across the divide were of the view that the ownership of the forest as also Reserved Forest rest squarely with the Schedule Hill tribes of the concerned area.‘The Second Schedule’ of the ‘The Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order, 1972 issued by the President of India in exercise of the power conferred by Article 371 C of the Constitution gives the ‘Scheduled Matters.” Para 3 states that “The allotment, Occupation, or use, or the setting apart of land (other than any land which is reserved forest) for the purpose of agriculture or grazing or for residential or other non-agricultural purposes or for any other purpose likely to promote the interest of the inhabitants of any village or town situated within the Hill Areas. The “Reserved Forest” is not included in the Schedule of the Hill Areas Committee (HAC). Therefore, it is the duty of the State Government to protect the Reserve Forest in the interest of all the communities in Manipur.I shall be grateful if the above observations are published in your esteem newspaper for the information of the readers.Yours faithfully,LB SinghCaptain Indian Navy (Retired)"
Sir-The-Sangai-Express-has-published-an-article-dated-14-Jul-2023-titled-Stop-the-partisan-conduct-COCOMI,"Sir,The Sangai Express has published an article dated 14 Jul 2023 titled 'Stop the partisan conduct, COCOMI advises'. In the article published, COCOMI has presented a series of baseless and hostile claims regarding Assam Rifles and its alleged inaction in the State. Such accusations are not only unfounded but also undermine the integrity and credibility of the security forces. It is essential to address these assertions with facts and reason, rather than succumbing to conjectures and insinuation.The Assam Rifles, operates strictly under the authority and jurisdiction of the Central Government, and its primary role is to maintain peace, security, and integrity in the region of responsibility. The claim that Assam Rifles is meddling with the affairs of the State lacks all evidence.Furthermore, suggesting that Assam Rifles has a secret agenda to promote narco-terrorism is a serious allegation that demands concrete proof. Assam Rifles has diligently worked in collaboration with local law enforcement agencies to combat drug and other contraband trafficking in the State. Since Jun 2020 till Jun 2023, a total of Rs 3500 Cr worth of contraband has been seized by Assam Rifles in NE. This year has seen Rs 971.58 Cr worth of contraband seized by AR in NE. The organisation making sweeping generalizations without providing any substantial evidence only serves to tarnish the reputation of the Assam Rifles and spread baseless fear among the public.The allegation that Assam Rifles is not proactive when it comes to the' protection of the Meitei residents is another fallacious narrative with no base. Assam Rifles has ensured zero Meitei casualities in the minority pockets during the initial days of the conflict. Our columns deployed in Churachandpur and Moreh especially were instrumental in the safe evacuation of local Meiteis. Approx. 2000 Meiteis from Serou in Kakching and 110 from Phaisangjang were evacuated by AR during peak strife thereby doing its bounden duty of protecting innocent civilians from any form of violence or harm.As for the grave and disgraceful claim of a potential presence of narco-terrorists within the Assam Rifles troops, any such assertion must be substantiated with credible evidence and thoroughly investigated before being propagated. Irresponsible speculation without proper verification undermines the hard work and sacrifices made by the men and women serving in the Assam Rifles.Lastly, suggesting that the Assam Rifles takes away and saves captured narco-terrorists is an outrageous accusation. The Assam Rifles is an integral part of the Indian security apparatus and is committed to upholding the rule of law. They collaborate closely with other law enforcement agencies to ensure the arrest and prosecution of individuals involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking.In conclusion, the facts twisting statements by COCOMI lacks evidence to support its claims and engages in sinister speculations, which can be detrimental to the trust the local population places in Assam Rifles. Assam Rifles has been the first responder along with Indian Army during the first brunt of the violence when opportunistic organisations were found without any strategy or plan of action to lend a helping hand to the battered local population.As the law and order situation is moving albeit slowly towards normalcy, such bluffs are being peddled to foment inter community mistrust to stay relevant.It is appealed to the press to have a fair and unbiased perspective while evaluating the actions of this organisation. Assam Rifles has an upright reputation of transparent investigations, appropriate disciplinary measures, and collaborative efforts that preserves integrity of the organisation since its inception. Such reckless views and diversionary comments made by individuals, projected through the esteemed media may be avoided as this may lead to firming up of a falsified narrative which is regrettable.Yours faithfully,Lieutenent Colonel,Staff Officer(Public Relations & Media)"

NEW-DELHI-Feb-18In-an-intriguing-discovery-researchers-have-stumbled-upon-a-frog-in-the-foothills-of-the-W,"NEW DELHI, Feb 18In an intriguing discovery, researchers have stumbled upon a frog in the foothills of the Western Ghats sporting an extraordinary feature -- a mushroom sprouting from its side. The finding, described in the journal Reptiles and Amphibians, has left the scientific community intrigued since it is the first time a mushroom has been seen growing in a living amphibian.The frog, identified as Rao's Intermediate Golden-backed Frog (Hylarana inter-media), was encountered by a team, including researchers from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), on June 19 last year in Karkala, Karnataka.This particular species is endemic to the Western Ghats of Karnataka and Kerala, specifically above the Palghat Gap, where it is known to thrive in relative abundance. The researchers noted approximately 40 of these frogs in a small roadside rainwater-fed pond.One individual stood out with a distinct outgrowth on its left flank, which upon closer examination, revealed a mushroom sprouting from its side, the researchers said. The frog was alive and moving despite this unusual appendage, they said.Further analysis by mycologists identified the mushroom as a species of Bonnet Mushroom (Mycena species), commonly found as a saprotroph on rotting wood. A saprotroph is an organism that feeds on non-living organic matter.This finding raises numerous questions regarding the ecological dynamics and potential symbiotic relationships between amphibians and fungi in their natural habitats. The discovery holds significance beyond its novelty. While fungi are known to play vital roles as saprotrophs or symbionts in ecosystems, their relationship with amphibians has largely been unexplored. The prognosis for the frog with the mushroom appendage could not be done since it was not captured for further study.""To the best of our knowledge, never has a mushroom sprouting from the flank of a live frog been documented,"" the authors of the study said. Researchers suspect that the humid, monsoon-fed Western Ghats may have provided an ideal environment for mushroom growth, providing adequate moisture and organic matter.The research team plans to continue monitoring the area and conduct further studies to unravel the mysteries surrounding this fascinating discovery. Previous research has found that in amphibians, the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is known to cause the disease chytridiomycosis, which has affected more than 700 species across the world.Recent studies have shown that this amphibian killer is present at low levels in all of the frog hotspots across India.

No official data on the number of Chin refugees or Kuki militants entering India through the Manipur border has been produced in the article, indicating a dearth of factual support for the argument. The fact remains that the official data does not corroborate at all with the claims of this article.The accusation of the Assam Rifles failing in its mandate is presented without providing any specific instance or evidence of such illusory failures.Overall, the shallow opinions in the article present a prejudiced perspective with a mischievous intent to disseminate jaundiced opinions that can be inflammatory, contribute to a divisive narrative and could potentially disrupt peace.Without evidence, the statements must be seen as an attempt to create a negative narrative which unravels the credibility of the argument.You are requested to adhere to responsible journalism & the principle of accuracy & fairness.Yours faithfullyStaff Officer (Public Relations & Media) of IGAR (South)"

Therefore, various departments of the State Government like Revenue, Water Resources, IT etc should join hands with Agriculture Department to address the issue of the unproductive 9 months in order to increase foodgrains productivity and other crops and minimize dependency on other States.He was speaking as chief guest at the valedictory function of the 3-day State Agricultural Fair, 2019 held at Iboyaima Shumang Leela Sanglen, Palace Compound today.The programme was organised by the State Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute(SAMETI) in association with the Department of Agriculture. It was sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India.M Joy Commissioner (Agriculture), and Dr I Meghachandra Singh attended the function as president and guest of honour respectively.Karam Shyam said that he was overwhelmed on seeing different vegetables, fruits and other produces produced by farmers of different districts of Manipur, adding that each district produces its own unique variety.Highlighting the problems faced by agricultural sector due to the vagaries of monsoon, he mentioned that experts should conduct awareness programmes and training for the welfare of farmers apart from imparting agricultural know-how and technology. In this way, the problem of scarcity of food can be addressed, he added.Shyam also stated that such agri-fairs should be held regularly just like the Sangai Festival with funding from the Centre as it will help in boosting the State’s economy . He also appealed the Agriculture Department to extend the duration of the fair to more than 3 days, like around 10 days at least in public interest.Dr I Meghachandra stated that different strategies need to be adopted to combat climate change, drought problem, uncertain rain and water storage issues.Speaking as president of the function, Commissioner M Joy expressed concern over farmers’ grievances in terms of climate change, technology etc. and added that a collective effort is required to help farmers for better productivity.State level best farmer award was conferred on T Phulen Luwang of Bishnupur district while S Korouhanba of Imphal East district and Farmer’s Club promoted by KVK Thoubal bagged the best exemplary and best entrepreneur stall awards respectively.ATMA Churachandpur grabbed the best performing ATMA district award while the best farmer district level awards were given to 18 persons belonging to the different districts of Manipur.About 46 stalls were opened in the State Agriculture Fair."

The government should talk to us to resolve the issue. This agitation is not going to stop anytime soon and it will spread from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Mr Tikait said the government wants to destroy the country by turning the farmers into labourers.""They have already ended the 'mandi' system in Bihar and now they want to do it across the country.

The farmers were not allowed to go to gurdwaras and they were also stopped at railway stations,"" he claimed.The farmers also raised slogans against the Union government at the protest venue. Several women farmers also joined the protest.There were yellow, red, blue and white coloured flags that were carried by different farmers signifying their affiliation to different farm unions.Farmers from states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal had come for the mahapanchayat.Harman Singh, a farmer from Punjab's Patiala, said he arrived in the capital on Wednesday night.""We want the Centre's policies to be pro-farmers. We also want our demand for an MSP (minimum support price) on crops to be fulfilled,"" he said.Ravinder Singh, a farmer from Punjab's Bathinda, said action should be taken against the accused in the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri in October 2021.""We want action against the person who drove his car over farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri.

Newmai-News-NetworkDIMAPUR-Jan-29-The-NSCN-IM-has-gone-hammer-and-tongs-against-drug-trafficking-In-it,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Jan 29: The NSCN-IM has gone “hammer and tongs” against drug trafficking.In its official bulletin “Nagalim Voice” issued today, the NSCN-IM said, “Better late than never, finally NSCN-IM is going hammer and tongs against drug trafficking”. Given the seriousness of the crime that goes with drug trafficking “we have awakened to face the reality lest we are put on the wrong side of international war against drugs”, it stated.To begin with, the NSCN-IM bulletin said it had issued warning statements against its own members that nobody will be spared if found indulging in drug trafficking in any manner.“Irrespective of rank or status, high or low, a befitting penalty will be given. There is no point shouting from rooftop against drugs trafficking if our own kitchen is not made cleanse of drugs,” the NSCN-IM bulletin added.It then said everything must begin in right earnest to send home the message across that NSCN has not degenerated into something the world will find pleasure to laugh away for choosing to go the way of lipstick fight against drugs. “We are, therefore, going full throttle to run down on our own members,” it further added."
Sir-While-congratulating-your-taking-over-the-most-challenging-job-as-Chairman-of-the-IAUC-Manipu,"Sir,While congratulating your taking over the most challenging job as Chairman of the IAUC, Manipur and expressing our firm belief that you will do whatever is possible within your official, legal and discretionary powers to do justice with an iron hand to bring peace to this (once peaceful but burning today) State, I beg to place herewith some points along with the doubts and fears of the general public for your kind clarification through a public statement or through your press briefing.(1) In the current situation, International and National media have reportedly drawn a picture of the Meitei brutality mercilessly torturing our Tribal brothers, burning their houses, trying to push them out of Manipur.- Are the GoI and Gom also sharing the same view? If not, what are the views of the GoI and GoM?(2) Some parts of Meitei villages in Churachandpur were reportedly attacked, houses vandalized and torched in the evening of 03/05/2023. Neither the State Police nor the Assam Rifles, despite repeated SoS calls, ventured to protect the victims. But the Police came only to arrest the Myanmarese (who cannot speak Kuki and/or any other Tribal dialect used in CCpur fluently) who was caught with his gun by the defending villagers while shooting and injuring 2(two) villagers. The Police refused to take away with them the injured for medical attention. The Assam Rifles reached the place after 2.30 am (04/05/2023) and made the villagers feel relieved. The AR Officers reportedly instructed the villagers to go with them to their camp for safety with assurance that they (AR) will protect the remaining houses and properties in the village. Movement of villagers to the AR Camp (Tuibong) completed at around 7.30 am (04/05/2023). Nobody grouse the difficulties that passed through in the AR custody for the difficulties on the part of the AR for a sudden incident like that is well understood. One of the villagers died of shock around mid-day but the corpse remained with the crowd for 4 (four) days. The person with the bullet unremoved for many days. Despite proclaiming curfew within the whole of Churachandpur District, armed groups speaking Myanmarese led by locally known Kuki and ZRA Activist started entering the village at around 9 am (04/05/2023), started burning small houses/cottages and vandalized houses which the miscreants might have presumed to have been completely looted started burning from around 9.30 pm of 04/05/2023. Similar activities went on for the next 7-8 days. Thereafter, unburnt structures of the buildings were pulled down using Bulldozers and Earth-Movers (Proclain/JCB), all in broad daylight. It is a mission “Delete the Trace of Meiteis from the land” with the unwritten concurrence of the District Admn./Police.- Do the above statement tally with the report of the Distt. Admn./Police and the last sentence of the para admitted?, if not, may kindly enlighten the public with the official version.(3) An appeal of the Hon’ble CM not to disturb the vehicular movements of the Security Forces, more particularly the Assam Rifles has been made through the print and electronic media. We, as honourable and patriotic citizens are supposed to spread awareness to the people hitherto ignorant. Unfortunately however, we find it difficult to find words for explanation in defense of the AR in view of some pin-pointed incidents when Manipur Police/IRB cornered them. We wish all these allegations to be wild imaginations of rumour mongers. We don’t want to believe what the TV Channels had broadcasted as news bulletin the “Sugnu Police Station incident of 02/06/2023”, but for that, we need clear explanations. Kindly make us, the literate public, aware of the actual facts and the state policies through media so that we can comfortably and confidently talk to our mothers and sisters and convince them. Please also advice the Hon’ble CM in your capacity as Chairman (IAUC) to add four words “he won’t betray us” just after his trademark words “please trust and have faith in his Govt.” while making public appeals through media.Hope you will kindly have a serious study of this letter, ensure due acknowledgement through print and electronic media and provide us the privilege of hearing from you on all the points mentioned above in the public and national interest.Yours faithfully,Thokchom Netaji MeiteiNambol Makha Leikai, Nambol, Manipur"
Newmai-News-NetworkDIMAPUR-Jan-27-In-response-to-the-venomous-allegations-made-by-the-Working-Committee,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Jan 27: In response to the “venomous allegations” made by the Working Committee of NNPGs on January 18, and subsequently circulated in local dailies and on social media, the Naga Hoho said today that the federal assembly of Naga Hoho, convened on January 23 at Rengma Gaon in Assam, unequivocally ""condemns the baseless statements propagated"" against Naga Hoho.In a statement issued today, the Naga Hoho said “the orchestrated attacks” by the WC of NNPGs, certain organizations, and individuals, attempting to label Naga Hoho as a mere mouthpiece of NSCN-IM, are not only unfounded but also a blatant attempt to undermine the very fabric of Naga civil society. The Naga Hoho also said it is an institution with a “storied history”, and has come under relentless assault, revealing a sinister pattern of dismantling Naga civil society, as envisioned by Ajit Doval, the National Security Advisor, who declared civil society as the new frontier of war.“As we examine the Naga Hoho constitution points, it raises a poignant question: Do the finger-pointers no longer cherish and uphold the mandate of Naga Hoho, or have their minds and hearts lost connection with the essence of our collective aspirations?” asked the Naga Hoho.The Naga Hoho alleged that the attacks on Naga Hoho aim not only to tarnish its image but also to sow discord within the Naga community. “This orchestrated assault, influenced by divisive forces, poses a severe threat to Naga unity and sovereignty,” the statement also said. The Naga Hoho “defiantly” asserted that it will not succumb to these “treacherous machinations orchestrated” by those acting as blatant collaborators of India.In this crucial juncture, the Naga Hoho called upon the Naga people and the global community to recognize the “orchestrated attempts to dismantle Naga civil society and resist the divisive forces that threaten the collective vision for Naga self-determination and sovereignty”."
Oinam-Nabakishore-Singh-IAS-Retd-Since-the-violence-erupted-on-the-3rd-May-2023-in-Manipur-different-rea,"Oinam Nabakishore Singh, IAS (Retd)Since the violence erupted on the 3rd May, 2023 in Manipur, different reasons have been cited by many important people in positions of authority, civil society organizations, media, academics, and individuals. Since the Tribal Solidarity March spearheaded by All Tribal Students Union (ATSUM) in hill districts of Manipur on the 3rd May, 2023 against the orders of Manipur High Court of 27th March, 2023 directing State respondent, Manipur to send recommendations to the Union Government for inclusion of Meitei community in the list of Scheduled Tribes in the country was followed by violence, many including Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah attributed the violence to the orders and judgment of Manipur High Court referred here to be the cause of the violence.There were protests, marches sponsored by ATSUM on the 3rd May, 2023 in all hill district headquarters including those inhabited by people of Naga tribes, which ended peacefully without any incident. One may be prompted to ask a question as to why there was different reactions from two broad groups of tribes, namely, Kuki-Zo and Nagas, to the demand for inclusion of Meitei in the list of Scheduled Tribes for Meitei ? Prima facie, both the communities are vehemently against the demand by Meiteis. One may be led to jump to a conclusion that demand for ST status by Meitei may not be the sole reason behind the violence; rather it could have provided the spark to the simmering discontent for altogether different causes. It may be preposterous to ascribe the Tribal Solidarity March to be causes of the violence. In fact, the march had ended peacefully in Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Moreh well before the arson started there in the evening around 5.Before brushing aside the proposal of inclusion of Meiteis in ST list as relevant to the present crisis, it may be worthwhile to ponder over the perceptions with respect to demand by Meiteis, of those already included in the list of ST in Manipur. Under the policy of the Government of India, 7.5% of the jobs in the Ministries, Departments, any Organization of the Government including Central Public Sector undertakings, armed forces, Nationalized banks, authorities, etc. are reserved for those belonging to the Scheduled Tribes. Similarly, same reservation is made in educational institutions of the Union Government including medical colleges, engineering colleges, management institutes, Central universities, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Navodaya Vidyalaya, etc. in admissions across classes and streams of subjects. Having seen Meteis from close quarters as being educationally and socially more advanced, tribals in Manipur see a threat to the privileges they have been enjoying for ages. It is quite natural to see the reactions to the demand of Meiteis for inclusion in ST list.Land is a source of conflict among tribes in Africa and other continents, where agriculture is the main source of livelihood and sustenance. The same is true for Manipur. The traditional rights enjoyed by the Chiefs and tribals over land in the hill areas of Manipur are seen to be under threat by the proposed inclusion of Meiteis in ST list. Perception among tribal populace could be that the exclusive rights enjoyed by them as tribals would be encroached upon by the new entrants, Meiteis. It is logical to conclude that there would be strong opposition to the proposal of inclusion of Meiteis in ST list. Further, power asymmetry between tribal and non-tribals in the Government structuture would make tribals insecure.While it is conceivable and justified to harbor a strong resistance to the proposal among the people already in ST list, it is hard to digest a conclusion that the orders of Manipur High Court was the reason behind the eruption of violence. It appears that Union Home Minister was ill informed of the ground situation in Manipur, and he read in to the manifest media reports, which lie on the surface.If the demand for ST status and corresponding Tribal Solidarity March are not the sole reasons behind the violence, what could be the causes ? The oft-repeated explanation given first by Shri N Biren Singh, Chief Minister, Manipur is that illegal migrants from Myanmar are behind the present violence. He went to the extent of conspiracy among Chin-Kuki groups in Myanmar and Bangladesh to wage war against India. The same narrative was echoed by the Union Government. When the Chief Minister, Manipur is pressed for evidence, he mentions the name of Chairman of Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), who has entered into Suspension of Operation (SOO), agreement with Union and State Government of Manipur. It is reported that the said Chairman, Thanglianpau Guite, was once a Member of Parliament in Myanmar. Because of various factors like kinship, geographical contiguity of India and Myanmar having a common border, free migration from either side especially towards India, better economic opportunity in India, instability in Myanmar due to military rule, little or no restriction by the authorities on India side, encouragement by the politicians on Indian side, and easy mingling with local population because of similar ethnicity, there has been continuous flow of Chin-Zo-Kuki people from Myanmar to Manipur and Mizoram.An effort was made by Manipur Government to identify illegal migrants from Myanmar by constituting a Cabinet Sub-Committee under the leadership of Tribal Affairs Minister, Shri Letpao Haokip at the beginning of 2023. The said committee identified about 2200 odd illegal migrants. The Government was planning to provide shelter for them at Singnnat. However, it is possible that many more illegal immigrants had come to Manipur and settled in various parts mainly in Tengnoupal, Churanchand-pur and Kangpokpi districts over the last few decades with permission from the local chiefs of the villages.This assumption may be indirectly supported by the abnormal increase of about 1000 odd new villages, which came up in the last few years as claimed by the Chief Minister, Manipur. However, this is subject to verification by physically tracing the origin of the villages. It may be good to keep in mind that there is tradition of multiplication of villages among Kuki tribes as a tradition and for economic reasons. This could also contribute to the increase in their number of villages. While the size of Naga villages would go upto hundreds of houses, that of Kukis normally settle for twenties.Why should illegal immigrants from Myanmar start the violence by burning houses of Meiteis in Churachandpur ? Will it be correct to assume and conclude that they would find a place to settle a place by driving away Meiteis from Manipur. Would they have so much of resources and audacity to arm themselves to indulge in burning of Meitei houses initially ? It is doubtful that illegal migrants would be so emboldened to resort to   burning of houses in a foreign land without the support of local population. Illegal migrants, who were forced to leave Myanmar on account of conflict between the military and Chin Defence Force or Peoples Defence Force in Myanmar, came to Manipur to save their own lives, it would be preposterous to say that they are responsible for the violence in Manipur.It is possible that  they could have participated in the conflict by providing support in terms of manpower and tactical support. Prima facie, it is obvious that Union Government sings the same tune sung by Manipur Government. In case it is an external aggression, as implied in many statements, appropriate response is called for from the Union Government. Such diversionary statements are nothing short of diversionary tactics. It is true that Meiteis in general are against the illegal entry of Myanmar Nationals, there was no strong protest for their deportation. They are   quite tolerant towards the illegal migrants, who would be sent back to their country when normalcy returns. However, in case of those who enter Manipur with intention to permanently settle in Manipur, Meiteis will always ask for identification and deportation of such migrants. Here, the attitude and response of Kuki-Zo people in Manipur and Mizoram are contrastingly different from those of Meiteis.If the State Government sincerely identifies illegal migrants and segregate them in relief camps under the vigil of State machinery by providing distinct identity cards and collecting biometric data, the problem of illegal migrants is manageable. I am inclined to conclude that a few thousands of illegal migrants could not be the reason behind the present conflict as claimed by the Government of Manipur."
Karachi-Feb-7At-least-25-people-were-killed-and-42-others-injured-on-Wednesday-in-two-devastating-bomb-blas,"Karachi, Feb 7At least 25 people were killed and 42 others injured on Wednesday in two devastating bomb blasts targeting election offices in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province, a day before the general elections in the coup-prone country.In the first incident, a powerful blast outside the office of independent candidate Asfandyar Khan Kakar in Pishin district killed 17 people and wounded 30 others.Less than an hour later, another bomb blast took place outside the election office of a Jamiat-Ulema Islam-Pakistan in the Killa Abdullah area claiming the lives of eight people and injuring 12 others.Abdullah Zehri, a senior police official in Balochistan Panjgur, said that the blast outside the election office of candidate Asfandyar Khan Kakar was detonated remotely and was placed in a bag outside the building.""The condition of some of the injured is critical and they have been rushed to Quetta for treatment,"" he said.He said so far the body count from the blast was 17 but the casualties could rise.""Terrorists are targeting the election candidates to deter people from going to the polling stations but security personnel are being increased further to ensure the elections go ahead on schedule,"" Zehri said. According to local media reports, a powerful blast had ripped through the election office of a JUI candidate in the Killa Abdullah area and caused great damage in which eight people had already been killed.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) confirmed the two blasts and said security had been further enhanced in the province for Thursday's elections.""The perpetrators of these terror attacks will be caught and dealt with,"" a spokesperson of the ECP said.In a statement, Balochistan's Home Minister Jan Achakzai condemned the attacks and announced that elections would be held as per schedule.""In light of the tragic Pishin blast, which claimed the lives of 12 individuals and left 24 others injured, and Qilla Saifullah blast, which killed 10 people, it is important to emphasize that the scheduled elections will proceed as planned,"" he said in a statement on X.""Allow me to reiterate our unwavering commitment to relentlessly pursue terrorists until every last one of them is eliminated...Rest assured, we will not allow terrorists to undermine or sabotage this crucial democratic process,"" he further said.Caretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz has strongly condemned the blast outside the election office of an independent candidate in Pishin.According to a post on X, the interim minister offered his condolences to the families of the deceased.The attacks came ahead of elections on Thursday for which elaborate security measures have been taken by the authorities.Violence has been at its peak in Balochistan, bordering Afghanistan and Iran, in the lead-up to the February 8 general elections in Pakistan.On Tuesday, 10 grenade attacks were carried out at security posts, election campaign offices and rallies in different areas of the province.Since Sunday, there have been around 50 such attacks carried out in the province and in one incident in Sibi town attackers targeted an election rally of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf candidate for the National Assembly in which four people lost their lives and six were injured.Frontier Corps and Levies personnel had reached the spot of the blast in Panjgur but the local police officer in the area said the casualties could increase as it was a very powerful blast.Outlawed separatist groups in Balochistan have been carrying out attacks on security personnel, installations and government employees all over the province as they claim to be fighting a war to restore rights of the local people and an end to the alleged possession of the province's rich minerals by the government and security forces.But since last year they have stepped up attacks and have targeted the candidates contesting the general elections.Late last month, at least 24 militants, four security personnel and two civilians were killed during a three-day operation in the area.Law enforcement agencies also thwarted an attack at a government school in Pasni, where an explosive device was discovered near the Bagh Bazaar Government School.The militants have not spared even the residences of contesting candidates and late Tuesday night hand grenade attacks were carried out at the houses of Balochistan National Party-Mengal's candidate for National Assembly, Mir Mohammad Yaqoob, in Awaran district, and an attack on the house of PML-N candidate Mir Mohammad Aslam Buledi in Buleda.In Panjgur town, grenades were thrown at the houses of National Party leader Abdul Qadeer Sajdi and an independent candidate, Dr Noor Baloch, who remained unhurt in the attacks.Press Trust of India"
Dear-Editor-The-Sangai-Express-in-its-21-July-23-publication-presented-an-allegation-made-by-General-Secreta,"Dear Editor,The Sangai Express in its 21 July 23 publication presented an allegation made by General Secretary (Media) , Manipur people’s party, that  “Assam Rifles and Central Security Forces personnel have been accused of killing innocent Manipuri civilians and sexually assaulting and killing women and that the culprits of these crimes have not yet been appropriately punished.”Such sweeping accusations not only lack credibility but also disregard the unwavering commitment of Assam Rifles in upholding law and order in the region. The aforesaid unverified, malicious statement is clearly aimed at maligning the image of Assam Rifles and fan hatred against this security force which has been deployed across the state to safeguard the citizenry during these difficult times.We categorically reject the notion that the culprits of these alleged crimes have not been appropriately dealt with. Assam Rifles has consistently demonstrated its dedication to accountability and transparency, ensuring that any personnel found guilty of misconduct are subjected to strict disciplinary actions and brought to justice through the appropriate legal channels. Assam Rifles stands united in defending the honor and integrity of the citizens and upholds the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.”Given the law and order situation in the state currently, when the Government Agencies are involved in maintaining law, order and peace in the state, such malicious statements may incite hatred, disaffection and violence against the Assam Rifles, an effective agency of the Government.We require that the media exercise utmost responsibility and refrain from spreading misinformation that can sow seeds of discord and mistrust against this prestigious organisation that has served the nation with valour and dedication since centuries.Aabha KSLeiutenent ColonelStaff Officer(PublicRelations& Media)"
In-more-ways-than-one-the-outcome-of-the-Lok-Sabha-elections-at-least-in-the-Inner-seat-will-be-a-sort-of-a,"In more ways than one the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections, at least in the Inner seat, will be a sort of a referendum on the conduct of the BJP led Government at Imphal. The silence of the Prime Minister continues, even after more than 10 months of the clash first erupting on May 3, 2023,  the BJP led Government at Imphal does not seem to have any clue on how to deal with the violence, thousands continue to survive in the numerous relief centres set up across the length and breadth of the State, many are still missing and over 200 people have been killed. It is against this reality that Manipur will go to polls in two phases, on April 19 and April 26 with the results set to come out on June 4. Apart from the ongoing ethnic clash, the BJP led Government should also be answerable for the stark absence of the rule of law all over the State. This is something which can easily be seen from the emergence of numerous power centres and the creation of a free for all environment, with the latest example coming from the open vandalisation and looting of a fuel pump at Sekmaijin Hangun, Imphal West. The question is, will voters in the Inner Parliamentary Constituency go for the BJP candidate in the hustings or will it be a case of the Opposition, particularly the Congress, emerging as the benefactor. Early days, but these are questions which must have already started haunting the saffron party here, but expect the ‘resources’ within the BJP to come out with scripts which may just offset the narratives that have been spelt out adding that extra dose of spices to the election. In as much as the BJP may be lampooned for the sheer indifference shown by the Prime Minister, the inept handling of matters  by Imphal, the saffron party can still trump what it would call, measures taken to safeguard the interests of Manipur and her people, most notably the recent decision to suspend the Free Movement Regime along with the announcement that the entire length of the Indo-Myanmar border would be fenced. Add the oft repeated NRC line from the State Government and these are all points which can be used as trump cards by the saffron party. Plus it is more than certain that it would hark back to the time when the Inner Line Permit System was extended to Manipur which automatically exempted the State from the purview of the Citizenship Amendment Act. This is where it would be interesting to see the course to be charted by the Congress to blunt the supposed trump cards of the saffron party.The interests that the impending Lok Sabha elections has kicked up is in a way unprecedented, at least in the last three/four Parliamentary elections. The reason should not be far to seek. This is the first time that Manipur will go to polls to send its representatives to Parliament under the long shadow of the ethnic clash which erupted more than 10 months back. How people vote on April 19 and April 26 will reflect what lessons they have learnt from the past nearly 10 months. Much will also depend on how the different political parties are able to make sense of the fallouts of the ongoing clash. The prospects of all the political parties, particularly the Big Two-the BJP and the Congress-will also depend on the number of candidates in the fray. Which of the Big Two political parties stand to gain more if there are more candidates in the fray ? The very fact that this question is being raised should tell so many stories and one wonders if the different political parties and the intending candidates have given any thought to this. This is about the Inner Parliamentary Constituency and in the Outer Constituency the equation could be different. In the Naga dominated districts one important issue will obviously be the ongoing political negotiation between the NSCN (IM) and the Government of India while in the Kuki-ZO dominated districts it will be the question of a Separate Administration, the uncertain status of the Suspension of Operation pact, the ongoing ethnic clash etc. It is amid this reality that voters of 8 Assembly Constituencies which are located in the valley districts but fall in the Outer Constituency will get to play a key and critical role."

The Government, NGOs, Churches and the people must work collectively to improve this situation,” the minister said. He, however, said “drug circulation or consumption at the local level” has significantly come down following a massive drive launched by the State Government, Churches and civil society organisations.Hmar said 10 people, including a woman, have died due to drug abuse since January.

IMPHAL-Oct-7-Session-Judge-Imphal-West-today-rejected-the-bail-applications-filed-by-Pheiroijam-Landhoni-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 7: Session Judge, Imphal West, today, rejected the bail applications filed by Pheiroijam Landhoni, founder cum Principal of Standard Robarth Higher Secondary School and her daughter Pheiroijam Romita, coordinator of the same school, ruling that it did not find any ground to release them.Members of Babysana JAC tried to storm the Court  but they were stopped by a strong police posse outside the Court complex.Landhoni and her daughter Romita are presently lodged in judicial custody in connection with the mysterious death of N Babysana inside the hostel of the school on July 18.As fixed by the Session Judge Imphal West for further hearing of the bail application, the Court heard the submission of Additional PP, counsel assisting the APP and counsels of the bail petitioners in length today.During the hearing, the counsels of the two individuals submitted that the founder cum Principal and coordinator of Standard Robarth Higher Secondary School were arrested on August 3 after they surrendered and ever since then, they have been lodged in judicial custody.However, they are innocent and had no hand in the death of the girl and there are no evidences so far so as to implicate them in the case, the counsels claimed adding that as per that claims of the prosecution, the deceased was not happy and she did not want to go home and instead chose to stay in the boarding, which means that she was happy in the boarding.As per the police report, the victim committed suicide and hence there is no further need to detain the two individuals in custody. The seizure of a piece of rope from the house of the victim clearly shows that the two individuals had no hands in the suicide, the counsels contended adding that such plastic rope is not a prohibited item as such ropes are used in other purposes as well.It was also submitted that running of two schools has no connection with the alleged offence and the two arrested people command respect in the society and added that the two individuals cannot commit any offence which will tarnish the image of the school.On the other hand, the APP of the State submitted that there is no ground for releasing the two persons on bail as they have actual charge and control the school and the residential school which have been operating under their control and by their family.It was also revealed that corporal punishment was used and the school defied the Supreme Court guideline on child safety in schools. According to the second post mortem report, there is suspicion of sexual assault/ murder and the matter is under investigation, the APP contended.On the other hand, the Assisting Counsel also submitted that high probability of sexual assault and murder were mentioned in the second post mortem report.The Court, after hearing the submission of both parties, ruled that it did not find any ground for releasing the two individuals on bail and thus rejected and disposed their bail applications.During the hearing today, Babysana's father and some womenfolk were allowed entry into the Court room to witness the proceeding.On the other hand members of the JAC against the death of Babysana staged a protest outside the gate of the Court today too."
Kohima-Jan-16Naga-apex-bodies-and-Churches-have-urged-the-NSCN-IM-and-Naga-National-Political-Groups-NNP,"Kohima, Jan 16Naga apex bodies and Churches have urged the NSCN (IM) and Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) to come together and collaborate for the resolution of the Naga political issue without any delay.The appeal was made following a meeting of the Naga apex bodies and Church organisations in Dimapur district under the banner of Forum for Naga Reconciliation (FNR) on Monday.According to a statement issued by FNR here, the Naga bodies asked the two groups holding separate negotiations with the Government of India to resolve the Naga political issue to walk the statement ‘Nagas Are Moving Ahead’ declared on January 23, 2023.“In the spirit of sincerity and realism, the gathered bodies asked the NNPGs, which is composed of at least seven different Naga groups, and the NSCN (IM) to come to a meeting without delay and honour their commitments of ‘September Joint Accordant’ made on September 14, 2023; the “Kolkata Meeting” of October 18, 2022; and ‘Nagas are Moving Ahead’ declared on January 14, 2023?, it said.“This point was emphasised with a high note and urgency and expected the NNPG and the NSCN/GPRN to listen to the call of the Naga people,” FNR said.Following the “September Joint Accordant” inked on September 14 the NNPGs and the NSCN (IM) agreed to form the “Council of Naga Relationships and Cooperation” led by the convener of NNPGs and the chairman of NSCN, to explore, at the earliest, realistic ways for Nagas to move forward on the basis of Naga historical and political rights.The two Naga groups on January 14 last year also declared their unconditional commitment to collaborate for the resolution of the Naga political issue with the Government of India.However, with no positive outcome, Monday’s meeting of the Naga bodies and Churches also marked notwithstanding, their regional aspirations for growth and Nagas from every side must cooperate with each other without compulsion, the FNR said.“In case, due to personal reason(s), one is unable to cooperate, we must respect their position. The Nagas at large shall not allow room for undermining nor overbearing anyone. In everything, we seek peace with all and for all”, the FNR’s press release stated.Besides, the meeting also agreed to organise events in order to call upon the Government of India to accelerate the Naga political agreements before the general elections, it said.The FNR along with Naga apex bodies and Churches also called upon Naga people and respected citizens of the land to render support to the forms of transformative changes being dreamt of in accordance to global relevance.The Centre has been holding separate negotiations with NSCN (IM) since 1997 and the WC NNPGs since 2017.More than eight years have passed since the signing of the acclaimed Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015 with NSCN (IM) and another six years have gone by following the inking of Agreed Position on November 17, 2017 with WC NNPGs.The NSCN (IM) has remained adamant on its demand for a separate Flag and Constitution for the Nagas as well as integration of Naga inhabited areas spread over four States of India–Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland and also Myanmar.However, the Government of India is not willing to grant the demand.On the other hand, the WC of NNPGs has expressed their willingness to accept whatever is granted for now and continue with the talks.                  PTI"
Beijing-Dec-19At-least-127-people-were-killed-and-over-700-others-injured-when-a-powerful-6-2-magnitude-ear,"Beijing, Dec 19At least 127 people were killed and over 700 others injured when a powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake jolted a mountainous region of northwestern China late Monday night, the deadliest quake in the quake-prone region in nine years.The quake, followed by strong aftershocks, killed 113 people in Gansu, while 14 died in the neighbouring Qinghai province in the Himalayan region, local authorities said on Tuesday as they launched rescue efforts in icy conditions.Qinghai province is adjacent to the Tibet Himalayan region which is prone to frequent earthquakes due to shifting of continental plates.While 536 people were injured in Gansu, 182 people were wounded and 20 others missing in Qinghai, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.According to the China Earthquake Networks Centre, the shallow quake jolted Gansu and Qinghai provinces at 11:59 pm on Monday, with a focal depth of 10 kilometres.The epicentre of the earthquake Liugou township is about 8 km from the county seat of Jishishan Bao'an, Dongxiang, Sala autonomous county in Linxia Hui autonomous prefecture in Gansu.The earthquake damaged 155,393 houses in Gansu.The epicentre of the earthquake in Gansu was only 5 km away from the boundary between the two provinces. Within 50 km of the epicentre, there are 22 townships in Qinghai, Xinhua reported.Wang Wen, vice mayor of Haidong city in Qinghai, told the media that local departments will carry out safety checks on infrastructure like the supplies of power, water and gas, as well as communications to ensure that people's basic necessities are met.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang have ordered all-out rescue efforts to minimise casualties after the earthquake.Xi asked local authorities to rescue and treat the injured people promptly, and closely monitor the earthquake situation and weather changes to prevent secondary disasters.Monday night's quake was China's deadliest since an earthquake killed 617 people in Yunnan province in 2014.Residents interviewed by Shanghai-based media outlet The Paper on Tuesday said many people were asleep when the quake struck and did not have time to take shelter.According to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, a woman, who lives 90 km from the epicentre, said her house collapsed and she escaped being buried because she was still awake.Videos and photos circulating on social media showed firefighting crews trying to pull out residents buried under rubble and others showed quake victims taking shelter on the road while wrapped in quilts amidst biting cold.The quake has destroyed some rural roads, leading to power outages and telecommunication failures. The maintenance crew has been working overnight to repair the damaged infrastructure.Several villages suffered power failures and disruption of water.The Ministry of Transport, which monitors the operation of roads, said on Tuesday morning that a bridge across the Yellow River had cracked because of the quake.According to local meteorological authorities, the daily low temperature in Jishishan is reported to climb minus 10 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.The provincial fire and rescue department sent 580 rescuers aided with 88 fire engines, 12 search and rescue dogs, and more than 10,000 sets of equipment to the disaster area.The railway authority has suspended passenger and cargo trains passing through the quake zone and ordered a safety check of railway tracks.Meanwhile, a second quake struck the neighbouring Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region hours later on Tuesday.The Atux City of Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, was struck by the earthquake at 9:46 am local time on Tuesday, the CENC said.The epicentre, with a depth of 10 km, was monitored at 40.02 degrees north latitude and 77.86 degrees east longitude, the CENC said.Gansu and Qinghai also experienced aftershocks.

However, till now, there is no plan to make special arrangements for them,” the official told PTI on condition of anonymity.Manipur Lok Sabha will go to polls on April 19 and and April 26.Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar recently said that the EC has drawn up a scheme to allow displaced people in Manipur to cast their votes from the camps where they are staying.Manipur’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Pradeep Kumar Jha had told reporters that the scheme is limited to the State’s territorial jurisdiction.According to a tribal organisation of Manipur’s Churachandpur district, the Kuki-Zo people are also staying in Delhi and other cities across the country, besides Mizoram.In the past, the Election Commission had allowed the IDPs to exercise their franchise from the host States.Mizoram’s Bru people who fled to Tripura due to ethnic tension in 1997 were allowed to vote through postal ballots in Tripura’s relief camps. In 2018, however, exclusive polling stations were set up at a village on the Mizoram-Tripura border following opposition by Mizoram civil society groups that the Bru people should not vote in the relief camps.The Kashmiri IDPs living in Delhi have been allowed to vote from Delhi.Of the 9,196 people of Manipur who are staying in Mizoram, 1,340 are in 26 relief camps, while 7,856 are outside relief camps, the data said.Aizawl district hosts the highest number of displaced Manipuris at 4,446, followed by Kolasib district at 2,674 and Saitual district at 1,275, it said.The Manipuris, who took shelter in Mizoram mostly belong to the Kuki-Zo community, who share ethnic ties with the Mizos.They have taken shelter in the North Eastern State since May last year due to the ongoing ethnic violence in the neighbouring State.  PTI"

DJ-NarainContd-from-previous-issueThe-Centre-has-now-drawn-out-an-ambitious-plan-for-transforming-more-tha,"DJ NarainContd from previous issueThe Centre has now drawn out an ambitious plan for transforming more than 1300 railway stations in the country as ‘Amrit Bharat Stations’.The mission got a fillip, when in August 2023, Prime Minister, Shri Naren-dra Modi laid the founda- tion stone for the redevelopment of 508 Railway Stations across the country. Being redeveloped at a cost of more than Rs 24,470 crores, these 508 stations are spread across 27 states and union territories, including 55 each in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, 49 in Bihar, 44 in Maharashtra, 37 in West Bengal, 34 in Madhya Pradesh, 32 in Assam, 25 in Odisha, 22 in Punjab, 21 each in Gujarat and Telangana, 20 in Jharkhand, 18 each in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, 15 in Haryana, 13 in Karnataka among others.Results that are being seentoday, are an outcome of series of efforts and management initiatives being undertaken especially since 2019.Railway Minister Ash-wini Vaishnaw has gone on record saying “Our Prime Minister has a huge vision for station redevelopment. When we went with the original designs, he didn’t approve the designs. He told us to design the stations for 50 years ahead. So, we went back to the drawing board, redesigned the entire thing, and then started the construction. So, today we are doing the world’s largest station redevelopment program. 1309 stations are getting redeveloped”.Development/redevelopment of Railway Stations is complex in nature, involving safety of passengers & trains and requires various statutory clearances such as fire clearance, heritage, tree cutting, airport clearance etc. The progress also gets affected due to brown field related challenges such as shifting of utilities, infringements, operation of trains without hindering passenger movement, restrictions due to works carried out in close proximity of high voltage power lines etc. Wide spread consultations with Urban/Local Bodies and other stakeholders, experts, officers arebeing done for clearances required from concerned authorities for station development work.Modernisation of over 1300 Railway Stations is a colossal task and an all-inclusive thorough process has gone behind scientific redevelopment of these stations with speed and scale. The designing has been done in a holistic manner with discussions at the various levels before issuing tenders. Moreover, a standard tender document was curated and shared with all so as to ensure completion of work in a time bound manner. Indian Railways merged the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation for optimization of redevelopment work. Various top domain experts, Architects and piling agencies were empaneled for suitable use by all divisions and zonal offices. Creation of GatishaktiDirectorates in the Zones and Headquarter,besides training of over 9000 personnel for this, has also facilitated in streamlining and speeding up of the processes.The scheme involves preparation of Master Plans and their implementation in phases to improve the amenities at the stations like improvement of station access, circulating areas, waiting halls, toilets, lift/escalators as necessary, cleanliness, free WiFi, kiosks for local products through schemes like ‘One Station One Product”, better passenger information systems, executive lounges, nominated spaces for business meetings, landscaping etc. keeping in view the necessity at each such station.The scheme also envisages improvement of building, integrating the station with both sides of the city, multimodal integration, amenities for Divyangjans, sustainable and environment friendly solutions. Every station will have a spacious roof plaza with all passenger amenities at one place along with spaces for retail, cafeterias, recreational facilities.Master plan has been prepared for smooth movement of traffic, with adequate parking facilities and efforts would be there to ensure its integration with other modes of transportation like metro, bus etc.Green Building Techniques will be used, with solar energy, water conservation/recycling and improved tree cover.There will be segregation of arrival/departures, Clutter free platforms, improved surfaces, fully covered platforms.Unprecedented transformation of Indian Railway Stations is going to make every Indian proud and every tourist marvel at the pace the change that has taken place.

Ten-months-into-the-conflict-and-there-is-nothing-to-suggest-that-normalcy-is-anywhere-near-in-sight-The-ques,"Ten months into the conflict and there is nothing to suggest that normalcy is anywhere near in sight. The question is how long Manipur can afford to continue living in this state of conflict. A question which should be given top priority and the fact of the matter is, this question should have been raised a long time back. The fact that the conflict has dragged on for over 300 days should more than underline the fact that no serious efforts have been made to take Manipur on the track of normalcy and this is what is deeply disturbing. No logic explains the indifference of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, best exemplified by his deafening silence, but this should no longer be taken as the reason for the violence to continue. And if New Delhi does not seem to have any clue on how to deal with the ongoing clash, can one expect Imphal to come out with anything tangible to address the issue ? The answer should be obvious to all. This is the reality and perhaps this is where it becomes important to question whether the people as a whole have it in them to start talking the language of resolving the matter and put Manipur on the track of normalcy. Not an easy task, especially given the fact that there is nothing to suggest that the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) and the Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU) have moved on from their slogan ‘Solution first, Peace later.’ The solution that is being talked about here is clear but there is no way Manipur or even New Delhi would entertain such a preposterous suggestion though New Delhi has not uttered a single word on the Separate Administration demand put forth by the Kuki-Zo MLAs and the silence continues on the status of the Suspension of Operation pact. February 29 has come and gone, but there has been no official statement on the pact being extended. If it is not extended then does this mean that the SoO pact is no longer operative ? No words have come forth from the Union Home Ministry and what is at hand is a state of uncertainty. What it has served however is  ‘silencing’ the growing demand from Manipur that the SoO pact be abrogated. Remember the days running to February 29 and the loud audible demand raised to abrogate the SoO pact comes to mind, but now with no official confirmation on whether the pact has been extended or not, the demand has been muted to a certain extent. Can one read a political masterstroke in the silence maintained on the status of the SoO pact is a question which Manipur should be asking within itself now. More than the people, the Government at Imphal too should be raising this question and one wonders if the political leaders of Manipur have made any efforts to know the status of the SoO pact or are just being satisfied with the silence maintained by New Delhi.This is where one needs to understand the realpolitiks of inking and driving the SoO pact year after year since 2008. Understanding or trying to understand the geo-politics of the region, especially given the volatile situation in Myanmar, the fact that at least one of the SoO groups the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) is headed by a man from Myanmar and again another fact that the Kuki-Zos have close filial ties with the people of Myanmar who live along the Indo-Myanmar region, should be factored in while trying to understand the geo-politics of the region and why the SoO pact was signed in 2008. Plus an understanding of the armed movement in the region launched by the Nagas most notably under the NSCN (IM) and the other armed groups dominated by the Meitei people is needed. For over 15 years the SoO pact has been in force and peace cannot be part of the pact in any sense for the Kuki armed groups are not known to have ever targeted the security forces of India. This is where the question, why the SoO pact was inked rises and why it has been extended year after year since 2008. The focus of Manipur should now be on the status of the SoO pact. A state of uncertainty over this cannot be of any help in bringing Manipur to the path of normalcy and Delhi should acknowledge that geo-politics should not be allowed to ride roughshod over the fate of the indigenous people of the land."

-India-records-over-20-000-new-COVID-19-cases-in-a-row-tally-tops-6-48-lakhs,"New Delhi, Jul 4India recorded another spike in the cases of the corona-virus disease (COVID-19) after 22,771 fresh infections were reported from across the country in the last 24 hours, which have taken the tally to 648,315, Union Health Ministry’s data showed on Saturday.The country reported more than 20,000 COVID-19 cases for the second day in a row after 20,903 infections on Friday morning.The recovery rate further improved to 60.80% as 14,335 patients were cured of the viral disease between Friday and Saturday morning, according to the Health Ministry’s COVID-19 dashboard.So far, 394,226 people have been discharged from hospitals across the country.The number of active cases stood at 235,433 and the death toll reached 18,655 after 442 patients succumbed to the corona-virus disease in one day.The Union Health Ministry’s data showed Maha- rashtra, India’s worst-hit State, has 192,990 COVID-19 cases and 8,376 fatalities so far.The State is witnessing an increase in cases owing to targeted testing, senior Government officials said on condition of anonymity. These officials and independent experts said though there has been an increase in cases, the tally isn’t rising exponentially.Tamil Nadu is now the second State with more than 100,000 COVID-19 cases. The southern State has 102,721 infections and its death toll has reached 1,385.The high infection numbers in Tamil Nadu must be seen in tandem with its testing numbers. A total of 1.27 million people have been tested in 91 testing facilities as of Friday, the highest in the country.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said 95,40,132 samples have been tested so far and out of which 2,42,383 samples were tested on Friday.According to experts, the high infection numbers can also be attributed to the movement of people after Unlock 1 from June 8.In Delhi, there are 94,695 COVID-19 cases and the National capital has seen more fatalities than Tamil Nadu at 2,923 till date.Public health experts have said that the coronavirus pandemic will enter its post-peak period in Delhi in the first week of August if the Capital maintains a steady decline in cases.According to the experts, the reduction marks a definite flattening in the new Covid-19 cases curve but does not yet classify as a “reversal” of a peak because an untapped cluster or lack of precautions by people could still lead to a spike that pushes the daily cases higher than they have been so far.It can be said that the peak has passed if the same trajectory continues and new Covid-19 cases fall to about 1,500 a day for at least a week before falling further.The number of coronavirus cases has exceeded 11 million and killed more than half a million people since it was first reported from China’s Wuhan city in December last year.

PATNA-Jan-28-Nitish-Kumar-took-oath-today-as-the-Chief-Minister-of-Bihar-for-a-record-ninth-time-at-the-he,"PATNA, Jan 28Nitish Kumar took oath today as the Chief Minister of Bihar for a record ninth time, at the head of a fresh Government formed in partnership with the BJP.Mr Kumar is replacing his Ministers from the Rash-triya Janata Dal with those from the BJP and party leaders Samrat Chowdhury, Vijay Sinha and several others also took oath along with him at the Raj Bhavan this afternoon.Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the new Governmnet with a post on X, formerly Twitter.""The NDA Government formed in Bihar will leave no stone unturned for the development of the State and to fulfill the aspirations of its people. I congratulate @NitishKumar as Chief Minister and Samrat Chaudhary ji and Vijay Sinha ji on taking oath as Deputy Chief Ministers. I am confident that this team will serve my family members of the State with full dedication,"" read a rough translation of his post.This is also the fifth time in a decade the 72-year-old has changed camp -- the frequency of the process having earned him the pejorative ""Paltu Kumar"".Mr Kumar had parted company with the BJP last in 2022. At the time, the Chief Minister was concerned that the BJP could engineer a split in his Janata Dal United as they did in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena.While joining the NDA fold again today, he cited his disappointment with the Opposition bloc, saying though he got the front up and running, very little was being done by the others.""The new Grand Alliance that we created (in August 2022) is not in a good condition. The situation is not looking good,"" he said.""I have been working hard to make a successful, meaningful (INDIA) alliance, but no one else (in the alliance) has been doing anything... Gathbandhan main bhi gadbad chal rahan hai (something is wrong in the alliance). People are not happy,"" he had told reporters.Sources, though,  said Mr Kumar has been upset over the lack of clarity in INDIA bloc's poll preparations and being passed over as a possible Prime Ministerial candidate. The delays to seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls had been a further aggravation.Mr Kumar met Bihar Governor Rajendra Arlekar this morning and handed over his resignation. The Governor has asked Mr Kumar to continue as caretaker Chief Minister till a new government is in place. Later in the day, he submitted a letter of support from BJP legislators. The Governor has accepted the letter and Mr Kumar is set to return as Chief Minister for the ninth time.""I have resigned as Chief Minister and ended this government. I was getting suggestions from all around. I had quit an earlier alliance for a new tie-up. But the situation was not okay. So I have resigned,"" he told reporters shortly after putting in his papers.Mr Kumar said he took the decision following suggestions by his party members. ""I was facing difficulties in working with this alliance. When I explained this to party members, they advised me to resign,"" he said.He also referred to the INDIA alliance and how things were not moving. ""I got an alliance forged, but nobody was doing anything,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the Opposition bloc that aims to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls this year. Mr Kumar was one of the Opposition leaders at the forefront of forging the INDIA bloc. His resignation comes as a massive setback to the Opposition bloc, months before it takes on the formidable BJP in the Lok Sabha polls.In his first remarks after resignation, Mr Kumar also referred to a credit contest, apparently a swipe at his estranged ally, RJD. ""People were claiming that they are doing all the work,"" Mr Kumar said. A political career that started with taking on the Indira Gandhi government during the Emergency years, Mr Kumar had gained a reputation as a model of good governance in his earlier terms that came right after the corruption-tainted era of the RJD. Over the past decade, his repeated jumps across the political aisle have hit his popularity and his party JDU's electoral weight.The BJP, which had last year said its doors have closed for Mr Kumar forever, has now joined hands with him again. BJP MLAs and state leaders held a meeting this morning, shortly before Mr Kumar reached the Raj Bhavan. BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde said. ""All BJP MLAs have unanimously backed the proposal to form a BJP-JDU govt again for the  welfare of the people of Bihar."" Mr Tawde said Bihar BJP president Samrat Choudhary has been chosen as the leader of the party in Assembly.  Vijay Sinha, he said, would be the BJP's deputy leader in the House. According to the BJP sources, both Mr Choudhary and Mr Sinha may be sworn in as Deputy Chief Ministers to Mr Kumar, set for his ninth term in the top post.The new govt, sources said, will have ministers from JDU, BJP and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular). Eight ministers will take oath with Nitish Kumar. These include BJP's two Deputy CMs, BJP's Dr Prem Kumar, JDU's Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Bijendra Prasad Yadav and Shravan Kumar, HAM's Santosh Kumar Suman and Independent MLA Sumit Kumar Singh. Soon after Mr Kumar's resignation, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said he knew this would happen. In a swipe, he added that many people in the country are like 'Aaya Ram-Gaya Ram'. NDTV"
Ranchi-Dec-26Come-February-and-thou-sands-of-tribals-from-across-India-will-converge-in-New-Delhi-demandin,"Ranchi, Dec 26Come February and thou-sands of tribals from across India will converge in New Delhi, demanding converted tribals be removed from the ST list in what is turning out to be a nationwide campaign backed by the RSS and other Hindu groups.On Christmas eve, Ran-chi saw 5000 tribals swarm- ing the streets under the aegis of Janjati Suraksha Manch (JSM)—a forum that has decided to bring the tribals in one platform.JSM says tribals embracing Christianity get help from the Church and missionary institutions in their education and are also provided with financial help. This brings them socially and financially above their non-converted counterparts, who are deprived.Supporters of de-listing believe that the converted tribals get triple benefit—Support of foreign funds through churches, reservation benefits admissible to STs and the Government benefits in the name of being a religious minority.“The percentage of tribals who have embraced Christianity in Jharkhand will be around 15-20 % but if we look at the Government jobs and class I officers including the IAS, 80-90% are those who are converted,” said former Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and BJP leader, Karia Munda, who presided over the rally in Ranchi.While the demand for de-listing converted tribes is not new, growing dissent in various cities and the successful first mega rally on Sunday gave JSM a shot in the arm to hold the next one in New Delhi.The JSM, underlining the need to rationalise the disparity, said tribals from various States would raise the demand for reservation benefits for those who are actually poor, deprived and following their tradition in New Delhi.“In similar meetings in Nagpur, Nasik and Mumbai, tribals, several thousand in numbers, gathered as they acknowledged the deprivation they have been facing,” said Munda.He cited the example of Lakshadweep, where majority of the tribals have embraced Islam and are winning from ST reserved seats.National co-convener of JSM Rajkishore Hansda said that the architects of Indian constitution had made best efforts to protect the rights of 700 plus tribal and ethnic groups of the country, but these benefits went to handful of ‘well-meaning tribals’ who were backed by the Church or other religious groups.BJP that had earlier introduced Jharkhand Freedom of Religion Act 2017 to put brakes on conversion of tribals to Christianity or any other religion is giving voice to the non-converted masses that they have the sole right to enjoy benefits of reservation.Earlier, tribal leader from Jharkhand Kartik Oraon who had been a Minister in the then Indira Gandhi had moved the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Order (Amendment) Bill in 1967 which was referred to a joint committee. The committee in its recommendation had said that no person, who has given up tribal faith or faiths and has embraced either Christianity or Islam, can be a member of any Scheduled Tribe. The demand however never saw the light of the day.Times of India"

IMPHAL-Oct-4-The-ATSUM-has-questioned-the-alleged-unethical-and-illogical-recruitment-of-guest-faculties-at-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 4: The ATSUM has questioned the alleged unethical and illogical recruitment of guest faculties at Manipur University.A spectre of private fiefdom is haunting the recruitment and selection process of guest faculties in various departments of Manipur University besides gross violation of the selection norms of the University Grants Commission, said a press release issued by ATSUM general secretary Seiboi Haokip.Constitution of board of members for the selection committee in respect of Department of Political Science was done in utter disregard of the established rules and practices, it alleged.As per the convention, the ‘expert’ should be a faculty not below the rank of a full-fledged Professor but the so-called ‘expert’ Dhruba Pratim Sharma, a faculty in the Department of Political Science, Guwahati University is an Associate Professor, whereas rules of universities provide that only Professor should be nominated as external subject expert.The selection committee which was constituted to conduct interview for guest faculty in Political Science on August 25 was against the UGC guidelines and ethics, it decried.ATSUM alleged that the selection committee was constituted whimsically and interview was held just to select those candidates who are personally close to the Head of the Department. At least a candidate from the Schedule Tribe community should have been selected as social science is the traditional forte of ST candidates. This act could have balanced the dismal representation of less than 3 percent of ST out of 7.5 percent reserved seats in faculty positions, it lamented.Questioning the sanctity of the institution, it wondered as to why not a single post is given to ST candidates despite some candidates getting enviably high academic score.The matter was placed before the Administrator of the university on September 7 to nullify the recruitment but no action has been taken so far, ATSUM decried.It also demanded resignation of the Head of Department of Political Science on moral grounds for allegedly manipulating the selection process.ATSUM strongly condemns the culture of Manipur University where few authorities and teaching faculties see the university as their fiefdom in order to achieve their ill objectives, it said.

YANGON-Dec-21-Myanmar-s-military-has-likely-perpetrated-indiscriminate-attacks-on-civilians-and-used-banned,"YANGON, Dec 21Myanmar’s military has likely perpetrated indiscriminate attacks on civilians and used banned cluster munitions in its fight against ethnic minority insurgents, Amnesty International said on Dec 21, calling for an investigation of suspected war crimes.The junta is facing its biggest battlefield challenge since its 2021 coup, with coordinated rebel attacks on military posts in Shan State, bordering China, and in western Rakhine State.An air strike in Shan State earlier in December used bombs that were most likely cluster munitions, Amnesty said in a statement, citing evidence analysed by its weapon investigator.According to the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, one of three groups in the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the attack killed a resident and injured five people.Civilians in Pauk Taw, Rakhine State, suffered looting, arbitrary arrests, inhumane treatment and torture, Amnesty said, citing interviews with 10 civilians.“The Myanmar military has a blood-stained resume of indiscriminate attacks with devastating consequences for civilians, and its brutal response to a major offensive by armed groups fits a longstanding pattern,” said Mr Matt Wells, Director of Amnesty’s Crisis Response Programme.Reuters could not independently verify the report and the junta’s spokesperson, Zaw Min Tun, could not be reached for comment.He has denied State forces target civilians in operations he called legitimate actions against “terrorists”.More than 300,000 people have fled the fighting that erupted in late October, with more than two million displaced overall since the coup, according to the United Nations. The coup unravelled a decade of democracy and reform, with anger over a sweeping military crackdown fuelling a resistance movement and an intensification of fighting with ethnic minority rebels.China said it mediated a ceasefire between the rebels and the military, although the alliance said its campaign would continue. In a statement issued before the Amnesty report, the alliance said the military regularly threatened civilians, including through arbitrary arrests, use of human shields and torture. Separately, on Dec 21, the New York-based Human Rights Watch accused one rebel alliance group of abducting and forcibly recruiting fleeing civilians in Shan State. “The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) is violating the laws of war,” said Ms Elaine Pearson, its Asia Director. “Civilians should be able to seek safety from fighting without fearing that the Myanmar military or ethnic armed groups will force them into their armies.” Reuters"
IMPHAL-Oct-9-The-proscribed-PREPAK-has-called-upon-all-the-people-of-Kangleipak-Manipur-to-rise-and-fight-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 9: The proscribed PREPAK has called upon all the people of Kangleipak (Manipur) to rise and fight against the onslaught of Hindutva.With a racist population policy, India is bringing CAB to turn Kangleipak into  a land of non-local people, reads a statement issued by the outfit’s acting chairman Kh Sathy on the occasion of its 42nd raising day (October 9).The people of WESEA and organisations with the objective of National liberation must face the situation with seriousness. The people of Kangleipak must abandon the illusion that they will benefit from Indian Constitution.“We must save our society from the destruction caused by Hindutva. For this, the only way is to build an independent, progressive and an egalitarian Kanglei society. In order to achieve this goal, the people from both hills and valley must come together and take part in the National liberation struggle which lies in front of us. For this, we need to march towards the battle front of our revolutionary National liberation movement”, asserted the acting chairman.PREPAK also paid homage to those who laid down their lives in the revolutionary struggle to liberate Kangleipak from the ‘clutches of colonialism.’  The outfit further conveyed its greetings to the indigenous communities who have been living together facing brutal repression at the hands of the colonisers.It also greeted all the leaders and friends of revolutionary parties, also to the parties engaged in revolutionary movement in WESEA and the people of the world oppressed by colonialism.If Indian armed occupation and Hindu cultural domination which have been going on for ages are not resisted, then India will eventually engulf the people of Kangleipak leaving no trace, alleged the outfit. Act East Policy, Trans Asian Highway and railway will serve to wipe out the indigenous people of the region, it warned.What has been done to Kashmir is a clear act of Parliamentary dictatorship. Kashmiris are now locked inside their homes, children have been detained, students are not going to schools and there is a ban on media, a war has been waged against the people of Kashmir. Many countries and United Nations have opposed these measures, the outfit remarked.Similarly, the Indian Nationalism, democracy and Hindutva have been attempting to turn WESEA into a land of outsiders through Citizenship Amendment Bill. It wants to turn WESEA into a ‘settler colony’ with non-local people becoming majority, Sathy said.Indian military forces have stamped the people under their boots and tortured the people at gun point. Their conspiracy to wipe out the indigenous communities of WESEA from the face of this planet is now being brought up afresh. The situation has come to such a point where the people of Kangleipak are on the verge of being wiped out from the history of human civilization.“In order to save ourselves from this devastation, we need to search the basis for our liberation and take the path of National liberation. In order to liberate our Nation, we must wage an armed struggle against the enemy so that we do not get trapped by the enemy”, said the acting Chairman.Today, India is playing divisive politics in WESEA in order to foment tension between different communities. In the name of development, India is snatching natural resources and wealth. Oil, water, power and plants and herbs have been taken away using might, the outfit alleged.“Given this condition, if we are dreaming of autonomy and shared-sovereignty under the Indian system, it is a huge mistake. Now, Article 370 has been scrapped from Jammu and Kashmir. This matter compels us to be careful. All the communities in WESEA must understand that we will find nothing in the Constitution of India which will benefit us. Communities in WESEA, which India calls North East, must come together and collectively fight to regain the freedom that was snatched from us so that we can decide our own fate”, reads the statement.India is leading WESEA on an anti-revolutionary path to break the spine of the people of WESEA. India is cropping up rich contractors in WESEA who serve as compradors to exploit our resources and oppress the people. In name of trade and commerce, through WESEA, illicit drugs and substances are smuggled and the place is being developed as a profitable market for these harmful substances. Indian armed forces are taking advantage of this situation, using this conflict as a source of income, it alleged.It is important that every community of WESEA must understand this. WESEA has become a market where the world sell its cheap commodities and has become a transit point for drug trafficking. Indian military, police, political class and bourgeoise are all involved in this, further alleged the outfit.The newly emerging bourgeois class of WESEA are expanding their interest from the city centre to the outskirts. They are buying swathes of paddy lands, turning these valuable paddy lands into farm houses, using these places to spread the epidemic of capitalism. It has made the situation more complicated. It is same as the anti-revolutionary movement waged by the landlord class of Russia, known as Mir, to dismantle the 1917 Russian revolution, said PREPAK.Indian rule has curbed the educational institutes of WESEA and is oppressing the society. India has violated all human rights that people of WESEA deserve. Given this, India figured among countries with most cases of human rights violations in the recent 2019 list of United Nations, it alleged further.India has violated the freedom of speech and expression that people deserve. Representatives of JACs, clubs and Meira Paibis who are carrying forward the people’s movement, are slapped with criminal cases to silence them, it alleged."
Amid-speculation-of-an-early-conclusion-of-the-Naga-peace-talks-Opposition-Naga-Peoples-Front-NPF-has-stated-that-,"Guwahati, Oct 6Amid speculation of an early conclusion of the Naga peace talks, Opposition Naga Peoples Front (NPF) has stated that all groups should be taken on board for the final solution.A legislature party team of NPF led by former Chief Minister TR Zeliang met Nagaland Governor RN Ravi at the Raj Bhawan in Kohima on Saturday and conveyed the party’s stand.In a series of tweets after the meeting, Zeliang said that the interaction was “fruitful and productive and the discussions on a wide ranging issues delved “particularly on the Naga political solution”.“(We) suggested that all Naga groups should be taken on board before arriving at the final solution. The group led by Adino should also be invited for dialogue. And when the final solution is inked, it should not be a cause for dissent within the Naga family,” Zeliang tweeted.He added that Ravi assured “all means for an honourable and amicable solution to the decades-old vexed issue” would be explored.The Naga peace talks, which aims to resolve the demand by various Naga rebel outfits seeking greater autonomy including a separate Constitution and flag, have been going for over two decades.In August 2015, the Indian Government signed a Framework Agreement with National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), the oldest and biggest of the rebel outfits.Subsequently, seven other groups joined the talks to find a final and lasting solution. The Naga National Council (NNC) led by Adino Phizo, daughter of AZ Phizo (considered father of armed struggle in North East), is not part of the peace talks.RN Ravi, who was the Centre’s chief Interlocutor for the talks took charge as Nagaland Governor in August this year. His statement later that month that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants talks to conclude within 3 months led to speculations that the final agreement could be inked before the end of the year.“Any kind of final solution should not be a repeat of 16 Point Agreement or Shillong Accord which failed to bring about permanent peace to our land,” tweeted Zeliang on Saturday.The 16 Point Agreement was signed between Indian Government and Naga People’s Convention in July, 1960 and the Shillong Accord between the Centre and Naga outfits was signed at Shillong in November, 1975. Both agreements failed to resolve the Naga political issue.While the peace talks are at a crucial stage, two issues - a separate flag and a separate Constitution for Nagas - have become irritants in arriving at the final solution.In August, the NSCN-IM said a separate flag and Constitution were core issues to find an “honourable solution” to the Naga political issue and accused Indian Government of going slow in taking a stand on them.“Four years is a long period but the Framework Agreement is yet to have its fruition as the Government of India is going slow in taking its stand on core issues,” said a statement by the outfit.Hindustan Times"

New-Delhi-Dec-12The-Centre-has-told-the-Supreme-Court-that-it-is-not-possible-to-collect-data-on-illegal-mi,"New Delhi, Dec 12The Centre has told the Supreme Court that it is not possible to collect data on illegal migrants living in various parts of the country as the entry of foreign Nationals is clandestine and surreptitious.In its affidavit filed in the top Court which is examining the Constitutional validity of section 6A of the Citizenship Act relating to illegal immigrants in Assam, the Centre said 17,861 people have been granted citizenship under the provision.Answering the Court's query posed on December 7, the Centre said 32,381 people have been detected as foreigners under the orders of the foreigner's tribunal concerning the period of 1966-1971. Replying to the Court's query about the estimated inflow of illegal immigrants into India, including but not confined to Assam after March 25, 1971, the Centre said illegal immigrants enter the country without valid travel documents clandestinely and surreptitiously.""The detection, detention and deportation of such illegally staying foreign Nationals is a complex ongoing process. Since entry of such foreign Nationals into the country is clandestine and surreptitious, it is not possible to collect accurate data of such illegal immigrants living in various parts of the country,"" the Centre said.The Government said in the past five years from 2017 to 2022, 14,346 foreigners were deported.Giving some figures, the Centre said 100 foreign tribunals are presently working in Assam and as of October 31, 2023, more than 3.34 lakh cases have been disposed of and still 97, 714 as of October 31.It said the number of cases pending before the Gauhati High Court, arising from the orders of the Foreigners Tribunal is 8,461 as of December 1, 2023.The Government gave details about the working of the Assam Police, fencing of borders, border patrols and other mechanisms adopted to dissuade infiltration.On December 7, the top Court directed the Centre to provide data on the number of Bangladeshi immigrants granted Indian citizenship in Assam between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971.A five-Judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, which is hearing a batch of pleas on the validity of section 6A of the Citizenship Act, had asked the State Government to provide the data to the Centre for filing an affidavit.It had also asked the Centre to inform it about the steps taken to deal with illegal immigration into India, particularly the North Eastern States.Section 6A of the Citizenship Act relates to illegal immigrants in Assam.The provision was inserted into the Citizenship Act as a special provision to deal with the citizenship of people covered under the Assam Accord.It says those who came to Assam on or after January 1, 1966, but before March 25, 1971, from specified territories, including Bangladesh, per the Citizenship Act amended in 1985, and since then are residents of the North Eastern State, must register themselves under section 18 for acquiring Indian citizenship.As a result, the provision fixes March 25, 1971, as the cut-off date for granting citizenship to Bangladeshi migrants in Assam.PTI"
This-is-for-the-first-time-that-a-cultural-organisation-the-Arambai-Tenggol-in-this-case-has-summoned-all-Me,"This is for the first time that a cultural organisation, the Arambai Tenggol in this case, has summoned all Meitei MLAs to a meeting at the historic Kangla on January 24 and this again is the first time that Imphal has seen such a tight and heavy security bandobast in and around Kangla, at least in the last 20 years. The heavy security bandobast has to be seen beyond the annual beefed security exercise that one sees around Imphal whenever Republic Day comes around every year and is in line with the reality gripping Manipur since the evening of May 3, 2023. This is also perhaps the first time that a high level group of officials deputed by the Union Home Minister has arrived here with the primary objective of meeting the cultural organisation and in the process take a first hand account of what has been happening here since the past over 8 months. To The Sangai Express it was some sort of a first,  a surprise to learn that the high level group of officials deputed by New Delhi lost no time in meeting leaders of Arambai Tenggol straight on their arrival at Imphal and a brief report of the meeting on January 22, was added even as the report on their arrival had been finalised ! As of today, that is the evening of January 23, no one seems to know how things will develop, but the air is thick with tension, with many raising the question of whether the MLAs will attend the meeting lined up at Kangla and what will happen on January 24. This is irrespective of whether the MLAs do turn up for the meeting or not. To many it could be a case of heads you win, tails I lose. Other than the brief points put up by Arambai Tenggol during the brief meeting on January 22, nothing is clear on how the Central team responded or how it will respond in the coming days, but it is significant to note that some points which have caught the popular imagination of Manipur were put up-National Register of Citizens with 1951 as the base year, delisting the Kukis from the Scheduled Tribe list of the Constitution of India, abrogate the Suspension of Operation pact with Kuki militants, deport Myanmarese refugees from the detention centres to Mizoram and replace the Assam Rifles with other Central forces. Nothing new in the demand put forth, one may say, but the significant point is, these demands have been aired to a team deputed by no one less than Union Home Minister Amit Shah and this is where the significance of the meeting lies.Manipur should be understood in the context of the reality here. Delhi should not forget that over 200 people on either side have been killed. Houses have been pulled down, damaged, burnt and levelled to the ground. Thousands are still living at relief centres while many are missing. Moreh, Churachandpur and Kangpokpi have been cleansed of all Meiteis and their properties levelled to the ground. Take the series of fresh offensives at Moreh and it is but natural for the people to question what the Government is doing. And the clash erupted more than 8 months back. Yet Delhi continues to remain mute, a silence more than bordering on indifference. It is this which is deeply disturbing to the people of Manipur and one wonders whether this reality would have sunk into the consciousness of the three men team from the Centre or not. That such a question should be raised now should tell the story of the sheer neglect and indifference to the human crisis besetting Manipur for the last more than 8 months. The indifference is what is hard to digest. This certainly is not what is expected from the Government at the Centre. Take up steps that would not compromise on the integrity of the country and Manipur and make this be known to everyone. Chief Minister N Biren has already spoken his mind out on the conduct of the Central security forces and this is a point which should also be relayed to the three visiting official team from New Delhi. For now Imphal looks like a besieged city and Delhi should acknowledge that it is their silence, bordering on indifference, which has led things to come to such a pass."
NEW-DELHI-Mar-9The-Manipur-Government-on-Tuesday-informed-the-Delhi-High-Court-that-given-the-situation-the,"NEW DELHI, Mar 9The Manipur Government on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that given the situation there, it will not be appropriate to provide centres in the State for Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, 2024, to be held on May 26.A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora was dealing with a plea moved by the Zomi Students' Federation seeking a direction on the authorities to make alternate and adequate arrangements for tribal candidates from the hill districts in Manipur to enable them to take the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, 2024, and Indian Forest Service (Preliminary) Examination, 2024.The counsel appearing for the State of Manipur today handed over a letter to the Court written by the State's Chief Secretary stating that given the situation there and to maintain the examination's sanctity, it will not be appropriate to provide centres in the State for UPSC CSE 2024.The letter suggested that students from Manipur who are taking the examination may be considered for allotment at the nearest centres outside the State, as was done in 2023.However, the State of Manipur gave an undertaking to provide monetary assistance for travel to the students outside the State for writing the examination.Accordingly, the Court directed the counsel appearing for Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to obtain instructions in the matter and listed it for next hearing on Friday.The plea also sought a direction on reopening the application portal or window in order to enable the desirous candidates to opt for a centre of their choice in the State of Manipur.The petition contends that due to the given law and order situation and the geographical and demographic separation in Manipur, it is extremely difficult for the Kuki-Zomi tribal candidates from the hill districts of the State to travel to Imphal and appear for the examination.“The failure to provide for adequate alternate arrangements for the candidates belonging to the Kuki-Zomi community will cause grave prejudice to a large number of students who have spent considerable time in preparing for the CSE – preliminary examinations and will cause them irreparable damage for no fault of theirs,” the plea states.

All these States currently have FMR, which was implemented in 2018 as a part of India's Act East policy. Amit Shah's remarks came a month after India raised its security concerns with Myanmar, especially the challenges along the border including the influx of Myanmarese refugees in the country.Amit Shah also attacked the previous Congress regime and said that people had to pay bribes to get Government jobs during its tenure, and maintained that not a single penny had to be paid for employment under BJP rule.Speaking about the mega consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, Amit Shah said that Lord Ram would return home after 550 ""disrespectful"" years.""It's a matter of pride for entire India,"" he said, adding that the 'pran pratish- than' ceremony is happening at a time when the country is on its way to becoming a superpower.

Kyiv-Jan-28Ukraine-s-SBU-security-service-said-on-Saturday-it-had-uncovered-a-corruption-scheme-in-the-purc,"Kyiv, Jan 28Ukraine's SBU security service said on Saturday it had uncovered a corruption scheme in the purchase of arms by the country's military totalling the equivalent of about $40 million.The announcement of mass procurement fraud, confirmed by Ukraine's Defence Ministry, will have a huge resonance in a country beleaguered by Russia's nearly two-year-old invasion.The fight to root out endemic corruption remains a major issue as Ukraine presses its bid to secure membership in the European Union.The SBU said an investigation had ""exposed officials of the Ministry of Defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells.""""According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement.""The embezzlement, it said, involved the purchase of 1,00,000 mortar shells for the military.The SBU said a contract for the shells was clinched with Lviv Arsenal in August 2022 - six months into the war - and payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad.But no arms were ever provided, the statement said, with some funds then moved to other foreign accounts.The statement said five individuals had been served ""notices of suspicion"" - the first stage in Ukrainian legal proceedings - both in the ministry and the arms supplier. One suspect, it said, was detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border.Corruption within the military has been a particularly sensitive issue in Ukraine as it tries to maintain wartime public morale and present its case to join the 27-nation EU.Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov was dismissed last September over various corruption cases despite enjoying a solid reputation in representing Ukraine in its discussions with Western allies.Although he was not alleged to have engaged personally in corruption, several cases hit the military under his stewardship, one for supplying troops with food, another over procuring suitable clothing for servicemen.

Prabhat-KishoreContd-from-previous-issueMandal-formed-the-Government-with-the-support-of-the-Congress-Th,"Prabhat KishoreContd from previous issueMandal formed the Government with the support of the Congress.The Congress was not convenient  in  supporting a backward  Chief  Minister. To topple Mandal Government,  a break up in Congress took place and “Loktantrik Congress” under the leadership of Bhola Paswan Shastri, a Dusadh, was formed. Mandal remained in power for just 47 days (1st Jan 1968 to 22nd March 1968). Government of Samyukt Morcha under the leadership of Shastri took charge, but this Scheduled Caste CM also had to resign only after 95 days (22nd March 1968 to 29th June 1968) and for the first time in the history of Bihar, President Rule came into force on 29th June 1968.In the mid-term election of 1969, the Congress got only 118 seats and remained far from the magic  figure of 160. On 26th Feb. 1969, the Government was formed under the leadership of Sardar Harihar Singh, a Rajput (26th Feb 1969 to 22nd June 1969) of United Forum, but he was also unable to provide a stable Government. Due to large-scale defection of Ministers & legislators, the Harihar Singh Government was defeated in the Vidhan Sabha after securing only 143 votes against 164.Bhola Paswan Shastri took charge for the second time through double-cross of legislators from different parties. The Jansangh wanted to keep the Congress out of the Govern- ment. Congress also did not want  the leaders of Jan Sangh, PSP & SSP to be inducted in the Government. The Congress brought a no-confidence motion in the Vidhan Sabha which was passed with the support of Jan Sangh, and within 9 days Shastri  Govt. (22nd June 1969 to 4th July 1969)  collapsed. On 6th July 1969 President Rule was imposed, which was revoked on 16th Feb. 1970, when Daroga Prasad Roy, a Yadav, of the Congress was sworn in as CM. But again the upper caste lobby of the Congress could not accept Mr. Roy for a long time.In the Opposition, there was internal fight in the SSP between the upper and backward caste lobbies for leadership in which Kar-poori Thakur, a Nai, succeeded. Daroga Roy Govt. (16th Feb. 1970 to 22nd Dec. 1970) fell and Karpoori Thakur became CM on 22nd Dec. 1970 with the support of the Jan Sangh.He too became a victim of defections and had to resign on 2nd June 1971. A forum of like minded legislators named “Pragatishil Vidhayak Dal” was formed and its leader Bhola Paswan Shastri took over as  CM for the third time. He again fell to keep the legislators united and resigned on 27th December 1972; followed by President Rule on 9th Jan. 1972.In a span of just 5 years since 1967 to 1972, the people of Bihar faced 9 Chief Ministers. In a bid to eradicate the unstable political scenario, Congress was voted to power in 1972 election with 167 seats. The Congress continued its traditional game and in place of Ram Lakhan Yadav, the leader of the legislature party in the dissolved Assembly, Kedar Pandey, a Brahmin, was made the CM (19.3.1972 to 02.07.1973). Pandey Government stepped down within one year and for the first time in the history of Bihar a Muslim leader Abdul Gafoor  (02.07.1973 to 11.04.1975) was made the CM to counter the heavyweight Mishra brothers. Gafoor had to resign following the JP movement. Taking emotional sympathy of the assassination of the then Railway Minister Lalit Narayan Mishra in a bomb explosion in Samastipur in 1974, his younger brother Dr Jagannath Mishra, a Brahmin, became the CM (11.04.1975 to 30.04.1977) and during his tenure emergency was imposed on 25th June 1975. On 30 April 1977, Vidhan Sabha was dissolved and Bihar came under President’s Rule.In general election of June 1977, the Janata Party came to power with a landslide victory in the State. Despite strong opposition from State Janata Party president Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Karpoori Thakur was elected the leader of the legislature party and took oath as  the CM (24.06.1977 to 21.04.1979). Thakur  gained name & fame, when he implemented long-awaited Backward Class reservation in State Government services as well as institutions and distributed appointment letters to all unemployed engineers in the State.Under the patronage of Satyendra Narayan Sinha and even the blessings of  JP, there were aggressive protests against the reservation. Ultimately, Karpoori Thakur had to resign and Ram Sundar Das, a Chamar, took charge as CM (21.04.1979  to17.02.1980). The  key of power was with SN Sinha and  Dasji had no control over the administration. President’s Rule was imposed on 17th February 1980, and the Vidhan Sabha was dissolved.(Author is a technocrat & academician.)"

Eerily-reminiscent-of-the-now-withdrawn-three-Bills-of-2015-which-sought-to-protect-the-indigenous-people-of,"Eerily reminiscent of the now withdrawn three Bills of 2015, which sought to protect the indigenous people of the land. Back in September 2015, the State Assembly passed the Protection of Manipur People Bill,  2015, Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms (Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2015 and Manipur Shops and Establishments (Second Amendment) Bill, 2015 and in no time Churachandpur went up in flames, resulting in the death of nine people in police action. Fast forward to 2024 and a similar situation unfolded in the same town on February 15 and while the official line for the protest is ‘the suspension’ of a police Head Constable after he was found supping with armed persons in the midst of the ongoing violent conflict between the Meiteis and the Kukis, many have started reading between the lines questioning whether it is logical to see any connect between the suspension of the police official and such a large scale violence. It is along this line that the discerning folks have started putting two and two together to surmise that it could be a ploy to destroy all possible records following the public announcement of Chief Minister N Biren that anyone found entering Manipur after 1961 and settling here would be detected and deported. That many of the Kuki-Zo community come within the understanding of refugees is a given with even NSCN (IM) leader Thuingaleng Muivah having gone on record to state that they are not indigenous to the land and are refugees. There should be no argument over the fact that the Nagas understand the politics of the Kukis better than anyone else and it was only recently that the Meiteis opened their eyes to the fact that many of them entered the State of Manipur on the sly. The Sangai Express has already illustrated this point but a repeat is in line here-It was with a reason why the United Naga Council objected to the burial of a late Kuki scholar in Kangpokpi as he was not a native of the land having arrived from Myanmar earlier. A fact which was underlined by a report which The Sangai Express received from Kangpokpi at that time during the peak of the Covid pandemic. Again to repeat another point, it was no one else but a Kuki gentleman by the name Paolienlal Haokip who in a write up in a publication of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies on May 3, 2002, talked about how 20,000 Kukis entered Manipur after being driven out of Myanmar in 1967. The said writer in the same article went on to talk about how more entered Manipur and the other North Eastern States during the August 1998 uprising in Myanmar. The Sangai Express has already referred to the said article not once, but twice in the last few days, just to illustrate why the apprehension of illegal immigrants is real, very real. In the same article Mr Haokip went on to state how the drug trade became an easy avenue to make quick money. From here it can be easily inferred why the talk of narco terrorism is real.Back in 2015, the violent protest against the three Bills rested on the premise that the Hills Area Committee was not consulted and the Governor never gave her assent to the said Bills. Fast forward to 2024 and the official reason cooked up for the violent protest is the suspension of a police official.  Nothing can get more farcical than this. If the Tribal Solidarity Rally of May 3, 2023 rested on the false premise of the demand that the Meiteis be granted the Scheduled Tribe status, Churachandpur has taken the lie one more step by citing the violent protest on February 15, 2024 as due to the suspension of the said police official. The lies continue, the false narrative continues and making things all that more farcical is the allegation that Imphal has not taken any action against the Meitei police personnel found supping with the armed groups in the valley areas. Not surprising and the lies will continue for the May 3 rally rested and started off on a pack of lies and this was followed by the victim stories that were churned out with so much finesse that even the ongoing clash was sought to be interpreted along religious divide. That there could be a bigger agenda behind the violence at Churachandpur should be clear to all for this has come close on the heels of the announcement of the Chief Minister that all those found entering Manipur after 1961 would be packed off. This cannot be just a coincidence. New Delhi need to seriously take a look at this and question why the Kuki-Zos have opposed the decision to do away with the Free Movement Regime and fence the Indo-Myanmar border."

IMPHAL-Oct-8-Stating-that-it-will-intensify-its-stand-and-agitation-against-Citizenship-Amendment-Bill-CAB-the-,"IMPHAL, Oct 8: Stating that it will intensify its stand and agitation against Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), the Manipur Peoples Against CAB (MANPAC) has announced that as continuation of the mass protest against CAB organised on October 3, sensitization/awareness meeting on anti-CAB movement will be initiated in various parts of the  State.A statement issued by MANPAC alleged that the of Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his visit to Mizoram on October 5, that a clause will be inserted in the CAB to ensure no impact on the ILP System in Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, is an attempt to destroy the unity of the North East people.This is an open display of the Indian Government's divide and rule policy, it alleged, questioning the validity of the Union Home Minister's assurance as he has been rambling about one thing in Assam, another in Mizoram and will claim another in Manipur.Pointing out the statement made by Chief Minister N Biren Singh regarding the insertion of such a protective clause, MANPAC demanded the State Government and its leaders to respect the sentiments of the people and to camp at Delhi against CAB.It continued that it does not have any belief that the Central Government will include a clause for the protection of the Manipuri people even though it (Indian Government) claims otherwise. If the CM can camp at Delhi for 3 months for power struggle, MANPAC asked the the Government leaders to camp at Delhi for CAB and to pile pressure on the Central leaders.If they can do so, MANPAC and the people of Manipur will wait for them to come back to Manipur with garlands, it added.On the other hand, the special general council meeting of MANPAC was held yesterday and a permanent structure for the organisation was approved as well. It was resolved to let the convenor and the co-convenor of MANPAC continue with their respective posts while Zeliangrong Union president Amu Kamei was elected as the speaker and  Akhel Aimol was elected as the deputy speaker.An oath taking ceremony will be organised at the earliest, it added."

New-Delhi-Feb-15A-five-Judge-bench-of-Chief-Justice-of-India-DY-Chandrachud-Justices-Sanjiv-Khanna-BR-Gav,"New Delhi, Feb 15A five-Judge bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra delivered a unanimous verdict on Thursday, striking down the Electoral Bonds scheme as unconstitutionalThe bench was ruling on a batch of pleas challenging the legal validity of the Central Government's Electoral Bonds Scheme, which allows for anonymous funding to political parties.At the start of the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said there are two opinions, one by himself and another by Justice Sanjiv Khanna and both arrive at the same conclusion.The bench said that the petitions raised two main issues; whether amendments are violative of the right to information under Article 19(1)(a) and whether unlimited corporate funding violated free and fair elections.The CJI while reading out his judgement said that the Supreme Court holds that anonymous electoral bonds are violative of Right to Information and Article 19(1)(a).The Supreme Court said that information about corporate contributors through Electoral Bonds must be disclosed as the donations by companies are purely for quid pro quo purposes.The Court held that amendments in the Companies Act permitting unlimited political contributions by companies is arbitrary and unconstitutional.The Supreme Court said infringement of the Right to Information is not justified for the purpose of curbing black money.The Supreme Court ordered banks to forthwith stop issuing Electoral Bonds and that the State Bank of India (SBI) shall furnish the details of Electoral Bonds encashed by the political parties. The Court said that SBI should submit the details to the Election Commission of India and ECI shall publish these details on the website.A five-Judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud had on November 2 last year reserved its verdict in the matter.The scheme, which was notified by the Government on January 2, 2018, was pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties as part of efforts to bring transparency in political funding.According to the provisions of the scheme, only the political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which secured not less than 1 per cent of the votes polled in the last elections to the Lok Sabha or a State legislative Assembly are eligible to receive electoral bonds.An Electoral Bond is an instrument in the nature of a promissory note or bearer bond which can be purchased by any individual, company, firm or association of persons provided the person or body is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India.The bonds are issued specifically for the purpose of contribution of funds to political parties. The Centre in an affidavit had said that the methodology of the Electoral Bonds scheme are ""completely transparent"" mode of political funding and it is impossible to get black money or unaccounted money.Various petitions had been pending before the top Court challenging amendments made to different statutes through the Finance Act 2017 and Finance Act 2016 on the ground that they have opened doors to unlimited, unchecked funding of political parties.  ANI"

On Saturday, India saw a single-day rise of 752 coronavirus infections, the highest since May 21, 2023, while the active caseload has increased to 3,420, according to Union Health Ministry data.Twenty-two cases of JN.1 (21 from Goa and 1 from Kerala) have been detected in the country till December 21.JN.1 is a descendent lineage of BA.2.86, with the earliest sample collected on 25 August, 2023. In comparison to BA.2.86, JN.1 has the additional L455S mutation in the spike protein, making it more transmissible.However, no signs of new or unusual symptoms caused by the virus have been reported yet. So far, the symptoms reported are mostly restricted to upper respiratory tract infections.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), changes to the symptoms being caused by different Covid variants depend on the now wide-ranging variety of antibodies that people have from either vaccinations, prior infections by different variants, or both.“The types of symptoms and how severe they are usually depend more on a person’s immunity and overall health, rather than which variant causes the infection,” the CDC said in a report earlier this month on the JN.1 strain.Dr. Dipu T.S., Associate Professor, Division of Infectious Diseases, Amrita Hospital, Kochi, told IANS that “common symptoms associated with JN.1 include fever, coughing, tiredness, nasal congestion, runny nose, diarrhoea, and headaches”.Since other seasonal respiratory illnesses like influenza and RSV are doing the rounds, how these symptoms differ depend on whether people are specifically testing positive for Covid versus other infections, UK Health Security Agency’s Jonathon Mellor said on X. JN.1 now makes 44 per cent of cases in the US, as per CDC estimates “JN.1’s continued growth suggests that the variant is either more transmissible or better at evading our immune systems than other circulating variants. It is too early to know whether or to what extent JN.1 will cause an increase in infections or hospitalisations,” the CDC said on Friday. IANS"
Sir-In-today-s-social-media-landscape-it-stands-as-an-unappealing-reality-but-both-conflicting-factions-fi,"Sir,In today's social media landscape, it stands as an unappealing reality but both conflicting factions fiercely cling to their entrenched beliefs, leaving minimal space for a nuanced exchange...This so-called war of perception breeds ceaseless cycle of endless debates (Argument and Counter Argument) devoid of any visible resolution, serving only as an ego-boosting spectacle without any tangible outcomes.In the current context of ""war of perception"" on social media, individuals engaged in this conflict may not experience a cognitive conflict within themselves. This is because social media often presents an environment where people are exposed to information that aligns with their existing beliefs and perspectives, creating an echo chamber effect. This continual reinforcement of similar ideas and perspectives may not induce cognitive conflict between warring individual because it doesn't confront or challenge their established thoughts.Secondly, the mainland people exhibit minimal interest in our enduring conflict, rather preferring discussions on cricket or Bollywood over the internal narratives of Manipur. The impact of this perception war remains subdued among them unless propelled by some sensational news that captures their attention. Therefore, the opinions remains contained within the conflicting parties, rendering it impervious to the attention of mainland individuals, whose focus is largely diverted toward other more prominent spheres of interest.In this scenario, neither the physical nor perception-based conflicts can pave the way for a resolution unless our leaders showcase the essential political will and prompt intervention. Unfortunately, the absence of such determination and concerted efforts from our leaders to foster peace and restore normalcy remains a distant aspiration. Is the Government (both Central and State) stuck on the horns of a dilemma?Allow me to wrap up with this final thought “Do we really reap what we sow or is it just a conscientious lapse while picking the seeds”.Yours faithfully,Vasudev Phurailatpam"

Seoul-Apr-30North-Korea-s-vice-foreign-minister-said-on-Tuesday-the-United-States-will-face-undesired-consequences-if-it-fails-to-present-a-new-position-in-denuclearisation-talks-by-the-end-of-th,"Seoul, Apr 30North Korea’s vice foreign minister said on Tuesday the United States will face “undesired consequences” if it fails to present a new position in denuclearisation talks by the end of the year, state media reported.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set a year-end deadline for the United States to show more flexibility after his second summit with US President Donald Trump failed to produce a deal to end Pyongyang’s nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.But Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have brushed aside the deadline, calling for Kim to take action on his pledge to denuclearise after years of pursuing nuclear and rocket programmes in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions.North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui singled out Pompeo’s interview last week with CBS in which he said the United States may have to “change paths” if the negotiations break down. “Changing paths is not a privilege that only the United States has, but it could be our own choice if we make up our mind,” Choe said, according to the official KCNA news agency.“If the United States fails to reestablish its position within the timeline we gave, it will see truly undesired consequences.” She also said North Korea’s determination to denuclearise remained unchanged. It would happen “when the come comes”, but only if the United States changed its current calculations. “We know the path we will take, but we’re just hesitating to choose as we have set the deadline for the United States,” Choe said.The North had been seeking a deal to ease sanctions in exchange for dismantling some of its nuclear facilities, but Trump called for a “big deal” in which sanctions would be lifted if Pyongyang handed over all its nuclear weapons to the United States. Choe’s remarks continue the North’s attack on Trump’s point person on the nuclear negotiations, after another foreign ministry official rejected Pompeo as a counterpart, demanding a switch to someone “more careful and mature”.

Not-totally-unexpected-and-the-pattern-behind-the-moves-should-not-miss-anyone-Dig-a-little-deeper-and-it-sho,"Not totally unexpected and the pattern behind the moves should not miss anyone. Dig a little deeper and it should also be obvious to all those who have been closely following the turn of events since the evening of May 3, 2023. The three suspended Education Department officials may have pointed the ‘pressure’ finger at the elected representatives, the civil society organisations and student bodies to fraudulently issue the No Objection Certificate to affiliate some schools to the CBSE, bypassing the mandatory nod from the State Government, but what has been left unsaid is also loud and clear. The unsaid part is, the elected representatives, the civil society organisations and student organisations too must be under ‘intense pressure to pile the pressure on the three officials to go ahead and issue the NOCs’. And it is on the basis of this ‘pressure’ that the narrative of the clash has been sold to the pen pushers, the fly by night operators who air dash here and file the ‘stories’ they were told to tell to the rest of the world, play the victim card, try and paint the ongoing clash along religious line with the result that stories of ‘minority Christians being persecuted by the majority Hindus’ even made it to the floor of the European Parliament some time back and to give some sort of substance to the manipulated, cooked up stories come up with the Separate Administration call. It has been lies and more lies since the evening of May 3, 2023 with some even telling the story that tension was already very high between the Kukis and the Meiteis before the said date. A lie that has been called out with the plain and simple truth that the tension before May 3, 2023 was and should be taken as a clash of idea and perception between the Kukis and the Government of Manipur and not between the Kukis and the Meiteis. This is why no answer has been forthcoming on why Meitei houses were identified, picked out and set on fire at Torbung and a little later at Churachandpur on May 3 last year. This is where the Government and everyone should try and read between the lines in the very admission of the three officials of the Education Department that they were made to issue the NOC under duress.It should also be clear to one and all that the admission and the written apology to the Government would not have been possible without the active participation of those pulling the strings from behind. A cursory glance at the extracts of the written submission should be more than obvious that  they were all prepared under the tutelage of some who have a fair legal knowledge, the terms and language to use. Clearly the hands pulling the strings cannot be missed and these hands should also be seen and understood in the call for a Separate Administration, officially first raised by the ten Kuki-Zo MLAs. New Delhi must have also seen and read through the pattern and this is where it becomes imperative for Imphal to take it up from here and see how to present the case of Manipur more forcefully. And to take the case beyond the NOC issued to the said schools, Imphal need to seriously study why the three Education Department officials should submit such an admission at this point of time. The pressure from the elected representatives part may also be taken as the point from which the State Government may seriously study what course of action may be initiated against the 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs. For nine months the State Government has been sleeping over it and perhaps now is the time to understand the pulse of Manipur and see what may be done. Or will it be a case of waiting for the go ahead signal from New Delhi ? Even if the latter stands true, it would serve some purpose to spell it out to the people, else the angst will only continue to simmer and it would not do Manipur any good."
NEW-DELHI-Feb-12-The-recent-decision-by-the-Government-to-scrap-the-India-Myanmar-Free-Movement-Regime-FMR,"NEW DELHI, Feb 12The recent decision by the Government to scrap the India-Myanmar Free Movement Regime (FMR) and initiate comprehensive measures to fortify the border is a crucial step towards safeguarding the internal security and demographic integrity of the North Eastern States.The Union Home Minister’s announcement underscores the Government’s commitment to addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by porous borders and cross-border infiltrations.The North Eastern region, with its diverse ethnic landscape and strategic geographical position, has long grappled with security concerns emanating from its porous borders with Myanmar. The India-Myanmar border, stretching over 1,643 kilometres through States like Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, has been susceptible to illegal immigration, insurgent activities and smuggling operations facilitated by the lax enforcement of border regulations. The scrapping of the FMR, which allowed unrestricted movement of people within 16 kilometres of the border without documentation, signals a shift towards a more stringent border control regime. This decision, coupled with the proposed fencing of the entire border and the establishment of patrol tracks for enhanced surveillance, reflects the Government’s proactive approach to bolstering security infrastructure in the region.The influx of illegal immigrants and insurgents from Myanmar has strained law enforcement efforts and heightened tensions within the North Eastern States. Instances of ethnic violence, such as the recent clashes in Manipur, underscore the delicate socio-political dynamics at play in the region. The influx of refugees fleeing the political turmoil in Myanmar further exacerbates existing challenges, necessitating urgent measures to manage the humanitarian crisis while ensuring national security interests.The significance of securing the India-Myanmar border extends beyond border management; it is integral to preserving the demographic balance and cultural heritage of the North Eastern States. The influx of outsiders has the potential to alter the socio-economic landscape and disrupt communal harmony, posing a long-term threat to the region’s stability and cohesion. By taking decisive action to fortify the border and address the root causes of insecurity, the Government reaffirms its commitment to the welfare of the people of the North East and the broader National interest.Courtesy Daily Excelsior"
Things-cannot-get-worse-than-this-and-as-is-widely-held-and-believed-the-real-character-of-a-people-comes-to,"Things cannot get worse than this and as is widely held and believed, the real character of a people comes to the fore at the time of a crisis and  this is perhaps the right time to ask whether what one is witnessing is the emergence of the true character of Manipur or to be more precise the character of the Meiteis. One need not go back to the distant past but take stock of the ugly developments in Imphal in the last couple of days to understand this. In the evening of February 23 a powerful explosion ripped across the office of a student body, injuring two with one later succumbing to his injuries. Following this, select and identified offices of civil society organisations were attacked and set on fire, apart from severely assaulting a young man staying on rent near or at the premises of one of the offices. The Imphal based media, both print and electronic shut down for two days, on February 25 and 26, unable to bear the pressure mounted on them in the battle for legitimacy and turf between two powerful groups and as if to say that this is not enough, a police officer of the rank of Additional SP was abducted from his own house on February 27 evening. Apart from the assault and abduction of the police officer, at least four cars were vandalised and in the melee that followed three civilians who happened to be in the vicinity of the officer’s residence received bullet injuries. The tragedy that is being scripted seems almost ready to start writing the epitaph of the great Meitei community in Manipur. Painful is too mild an expression to put into words that must be felt by all right thinking citizens of the land. Compounding the sense of tragedy is the fact that all these ugly developments have come at this point of time, even as the clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis seems set to continue, as it has for over 9 months now. Even as the whole country and everyone in Manipur seems glued to the ethnic clash that started from the evening of May 3, 2023, no one seems to know the exact figure of the number of deaths as well as the number of missing persons. No one also knows the exact number of houses that have been bulldozed and flattened to the ground at Churachandpur, Moreh, Kangpokpi and damaged in some areas of Imphal. This also stands true on the number of people taking refuge at the different relief centres set up across the length and breadth of the State. No one, much less the Government, seems to have any idea when the internally displaced people can return to the place they once called home and it is amid this reality that the ugly incidents mentioned above have been staged so nonchalantly.Amid the madness and the near total anarchy it would be apt to question what the State Government has been doing all this while. The attack at the office of the student body inside DM University is a case in point. When was the prohibitory order imposed at the said office of the student body lifted ? An answer to this should be forthcoming or if the prohibitory order was still in force then were any cops put on duty at the said campus ? Time was when police personnel could be seen on duty at the said office campus of the student body and one wonders whether the explosion took place despite the presence of the cops on duty. The chaos, the madness, the lawlessness, the near anarchic state that has come to define Imphal today is primarily due to the vacuum created and when such vacuums exist it is but natural for power players of different hues and colour to emerge and fill the void. This is what Manipur is witnessing right now and this reality has begun to take a toll on the people. What suggestions and proposals has the Security Advisor to the Government of Manipur put forward to deal with the emerging ugly scenario ? These are questions that should be raised, for caught in the middle of all the muscle flexing exercises are the people, a people who have been intimidated to such a level that they have preferred to toe the line of ‘silence being the greater part of valour.’ Imphal needs to get its act together and the people and all those concerned too should reciprocate and acknowledge that this is not the time for muscle flexing amongst the people but gear up to face any eventuality that could pose a threat to the understanding of Manipur."
Logical-follow-on-and-one-has-to-certainly-give-it-to-the-BJP-led-Government-at-Delhi-Back-on-January-20-Uni,"Logical follow on and one has to certainly give it to the BJP led Government at Delhi. Back on January 20, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had announced that the Centre would work towards lifting the Free Movement Regime on the Indo-Myanmar border. A regime which allows movement upto 16 kms on either side of the international border without passports and other paper works. Now fast forward to February 8, 2024 and the Government of India has decided to scrap the free movement regime with immediate effect. That this has come despite the stiff opposition raised by some, particularly the Nagas and the Kuki-Zos makes it all that more striking. Secure border, this is the slogan that has been raised and while the reasoning of New Delhi may revolve around the understanding of these two words slogan, to Manipur it could mean hammering one more nail in the coffin of the narco-terrorists, who have been crossing the border at will and playing havoc with the lives of the indigenous people of Manipur. It should also be clear, very clear that this cannot be the final answer to the ongoing turmoil. The most one can read into the new development is the line ‘one more step towards neutralising the incursion from across the border, which has turned the demographic composition of some places in the hills upside down.’ As noted, this cannot be taken to mean that scrapping the FMR is the final answer, but the first step towards correcting the large scale incursion from across the international border. This is the reason why Manipur cannot afford to rest easy on this. The steps that have been spelt out falls into a logical sequence. Next in line seems to be the much publicised announcement to fence the Indo-Myanmar border. This again is another step that has been opposed by the Nagas and the Kuki-Zos, but to many the reason for the opposition to it could be as different as cheese is from chalk. To the Nagas, it means curtailing the movement of its own people across the border while to the Kuki-Zos it could mean much more than mere movement. Mark the stress on the italicised word ‘movement’. There is no record of abnormal increase in the population of the Naga folks at Ukhrul and Kamjong side, much less the emergence of new settlements, while the same cannot be said of the Kuki-Zos. Herein lies a tale, a tale that has been central to the worries and consternation of Manipur.Scrapping FMR and border fencing and enforcement of a National Register of Citizens with 1951 as the base year should be the logical sequence. Manipur has suffered long enough due to the unchecked incursion from across the border and the very fact that the president of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Thanglianpau Guite, is a Myanmarese, an outfit which is a party to the Suspension of Operation pact signed with the Government of India and Government of Manipur should say something significant. A point which Chief Minister N Biren has raised more than once and the logical sequence demands that the Centre takes another long, hard look at the SoO pact. Will definitely defeat the understanding of scrapping FMR and fence the Indo-Myanmar border if the Centre is going to be engaged in a political dialogue with an armed outfit headed by a Myanmarese. Imphal should now rise to the occasion and see how it can present its case more effectively before New Delhi and ensure that the SoO outfits are reined in and one of the more effective ways would be to point out the dichotomy between scrapping FMR, fencing the border and engaging in a political with a group headed by a man from Myanmar. The new settlements that have sprung up, defying all understanding of natural human population growth, is another point that needs to be highlighted. Incursion from across the border should not be understood only in the period after the military coup in Myanmar but down the decades. This is the reason why it has been demanded that 1951 should be the base year for the NRC."

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-20-Two-beneficial-bacteria-have-been-detected-in-Ngari-produced-in-Manipur,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 20: Two beneficial bacteria have been detected in Ngari produced in Manipur.A project of fermentation of Phabou (Puntius spp) was initiated in 1985 at the erstwhile Manipur Agricultural College, Iroisemba (now Central Agricultural University) by Dr N Iboton Singh.Subsequent research led to the successful fermentation of Phabou to Ngari within 45 days using isolated bacteria from fresh quality Ngari of Khwairamband Ima Keithel. However, the specific bacteria involved were not identified at that time.In 2018, researchers collected samples of high-quality Ngari, Phabou, and fresh fish from vendors at Ima Keithel and Singjamei markets for bacterial isolation.Two new endoichthysic bacteria, Bacillus safiens and B. amyloliquifaciens, were consistently associated with Ngari collected from Singjamei market. These bacteria were identified for the first time after sequencing.Interestingly, most of the Ngari samples collected from Ima Keithel vendors failed to isolate both bacteria. However, these two bacteria were also found in fresh and dried Phabou Nga.With these bacteria, Ngari can be produced within 40-45 days. As such, the current gap between demand and supply can be narrowed down in the future using these beneficial bacteria.Fish fermentation has been reported in many countries, including China, Japan, and Korea. The bacteria used in these countries differ from those found in Manipur.Fish is known to provide proteins. Additionally, Bacillus spp are reported to produce peptide antibiotics. These peptides  exhibit broad-spectrum biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties.“Ngari from Manipur, laden with these useful bacterial antibiotics during the fermentation period, could protect us from several diseases”, said the researchers.During the plague epidemic caused by Bacillus yersinia pestis in India from 1896-1911, there were no reports of plague sufferers in Manipur. This might be due to the regular consumption of quality Ngari containing these Bacillus species.However, more scientific studies on health benefits need to be explored in the current era of climate change.Further research is underway at the Green Foundation in Imphal under the supervision of Prof Naorem Iboton Singh, former DEAN, College of Agriculture, CAU, Imphal.Ngari, a fermented fish product, is a staple in Manipuri cuisine, used as a flavour-enhancing ingredient in various dishes such as Singju, Morok metpa, and Iromba. Apart from Manipur, it is widely consumed and appreciated in the hill regions of Indian States like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura.Manipur, a region abundant in freshwater bodies, has historically been self-sufficient in fish production. The surplus fish were sun-dried and either sold or preserved.Despite the lower market value of sun-dried fish, Meetei people ingeniously transformed these into Ngari, a value-added product, using indigenous fermentation techniques. This process of fish fermentation, or Nga leeba, traditionally takes six to seven months."

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-21-How-many-parts-of-lotus-plants-are-edible-It-is-this-simple-curiosit,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 21 : How many parts of lotus plants are edible ? It is this simple curiosity coupled with the desire to be self reliant which led to the establishment of Yokchabi Enterprises, a food processing business which makes lotus tea, Thambou chips (lotus stem chips) and a variety of other items.Speaking to The Sangai Express, founder of Yokchabi Enterprises Hijam Ranjana said that she started her business in 2021 to be self-reliant. Ranjana (48) is a resident of Kongba Ucheckon and she started her food processing at her residence as the workshed.She is married to Atom Hemanta and the couple has two children, one son and a daughter.Saying that she encountered different obstacles at the initial stage of her business, Ranjana continued that she gained many valuable lessons on food processing after attending a training programme organised by Central Agricultural University (CAU).Ranjana said that she started selling Thambou chips which cost Rs 10 per packet at the neighbourhood shops.Saying that she now produces Thambou chips which cost upto Rs 80 per packet with better packaging quality, the entrepreneur maintained that she also sells her items at Delhi outlets with the help of the Horticulture  Department.Apart from Thambou chips, Yokchabi Enterprises also produces Thambou seasoning powder, dry fruit candy, plain and spicy cassava (u-mangra) chips and a mixture of Thambou, coconut and dry fruits among many other food items.Ranjana said that Yokchabi Enterprises has also launched a lotus tea but  proper marketing hasn't been done as of yet.Saying that she buys the lotus stem from Waithou, Mayang Imphal, Bishnupur and fruits from Ukhrul, Senapati and Mao, Ranjana added that the raw materials (thambal 108) for lotus tea come from Sendra.Thambal 108 is more aromatic, she said.Ranjana said that there is shortage of raw material as lotus plants are not harvested at many places.Saying that Yokchabi Enterprises mostly sells its products in Imphal East and Imphal West, Ranjana added that she makes about Rs 2000 to Rs 3000 on average daily.She said that she is targeting to increase her selling capacity to Rs 5000 daily.Yokchabi Enterprises employs six people and they get Rs 300 a day at the lowest, she added.Ranjana is the beneficiary of the Vocal for Local scheme of the Horticulture Department."
DIMAPUR-Oct-11-One-day-after-the-latest-round-of-peace-talks-which-was-held-in-New-Delhi-the-NSCN-IM-made-,"Newmai News NetworkDIMAPUR, Oct 11: One day after the latest round of peace talks, which was held in New Delhi, the NSCN-IM made an official statement, saying that it is “deeply committed to the Framework Agreement, and that it will stand by it at all costs in all events”.   The NSCN-IM also said, ""It is strongly opposed to imposition of one’s will on the other"".  However, the NSCN-IM statement did not elaborate the latter line.On October 10, the NSCN-IM team headed by its general secretary, Th Muivah and the Government of India's Interlocutor, RN Ravi had held talks. Sources said that both the parties dwelt on the issues of ‘flag’ and ‘constitution’ during the nearly a day-long discussion. Since the October 10 talk was inconclusive, both the NSCN-IM team and the Government of India’s Interlocutor agreed to meet again soon. One well placed source informed Newmai News Network tonight that both the parties will hold the next round of talks “as soon as possible”.Meanwhile, a report in Nagaland Today daily said that RN Ravi and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had a “closed-door” discussion on October 10. It was not clear whether they held the discussion after the latest round of Indo-Naga peace talks or in the morning.On the other hand, in its official statement issued this evening, the NSCN-IM alleged that, after 22 years long ""intensive"" negotiations, the Government of India “has now started trying to twist and backtrack on their commitments and words so that the hard-earned Framework Agreement is nullified on any pretext”. The NSCN-IM statement further said, ""It is surprising to see that the Government of India is trying to hijack the outcome of the talks by using a section of people who are not mandated and do not represent the Naga people and the Naga National issue"".The NSCN-IM then said, ""It should be understood that any proposed solution that betrays the Naga National issue will be but repetition of the past mistakes"". The statement added, ""We are sure it will be a great loss for both the two peoples if we miss this finest opportunity. After all, the truth never dies. No power in history has ever destroyed it"".According to the NSCN-IM, recognizing the reality that the case of the Nagas is political, and not a law and order problem of India, talks between the Government of India and NSCN resulted in the signing of the cease-fire agreement on August 1, 1997.“In the subsequent talks, the Government of India recognized the unique history and situation of the Nagas on July 11, 2002, which means that the Nagas have never been a part of Union of India nor that of Burma either by conquest of the two powers or by consent of the Nagas,” the NSCN-IM statement said.Based on the ""recognized unique history and situation of the Nagas"", the Government of India and NSCN-IM signed the “historic” Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015, the NSCN-IM stated, while adding that “the BJP Government under the leadership of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi took bold and positive step where it recognized the sovereignty of the Nagas stating, in keeping with the universal principle of democracy, 'sovereignty of the Nagas lies with the Naga people'”.  According to the NSCN-IM, it also ""states inclusive"" durable peaceful ‘co-existence of the two entities’ based on the principle of shared-sovereignty. The NSCN-IM statement then said that, by inclusiveness, NSCN-IM ""emphasizes""  inclusive of all Nagas in all areas and all aspects of agreed competencies, “and it cannot be misconstrued/interpreted as Union of India”.It stated that the “Naga National flag” is the symbol of the recognized Naga entity. “It is the covenant of God with the Naga people and the commitment of the Naga people to God,” the NSCN-IM said, adding, “The constitution of the Nagas is the book form of the recognized sovereignty and mutually agreed competencies”."

Sir-This-piece-is-written-in-a-mood-of-serious-concern-and-dismay-over-the-rather-unsavoury-incide,"Sir,This piece is written in a mood of serious concern and dismay over the rather unsavoury incidents and issues rattling Dhanamanjuri University (DMU) recently. Several newspapers including your own had been covering DMU’s student grievances, pertaining to every imaginable realm of university education over the past months and weeks. Like every other parent or guardian of university-going children (or wards) in Manipur, the establishment of this state university was a reason to rejoice. I earnestly enrolled four of my wards in three different post-graduate departments in successive years at DMU. This decision was made partly because the Covid-19 pandemic was hitting hard on an already frugal family income, and mostly because I, like many others, reposed a pensive faith in the state’s repeated and avowed attempts to reform the education sector. This elation was abruptly aborted and extremely short-lived however.Speaking from the shared perspective of many students and guardians, PG education since its inception in DMU seems to have willfully flouted most norms in the academic rulebook.While skipping the specifics to maintain anonymity,I prefer pointing out some worrisome issues confronting most students across almost all PG streams and departments at this university. For one, classes have been excruciatingly irregular and sporadic. Class routines and time-tables are a mere formality and rarely followed. Students often wait indefinitely for teachers to turn up, or have to attend impromptu classes scheduled through phone calls. It is rare to have two full classes on most working days. Three full classes on an even rarer day are nothing but absolute luxury. Few seem intent on compensating teaching-learning irregularities and deficits through quality web resources or online classes. Remedial classes and tutorials, or segregating slow and advanced learners, is also unthought-of. Internal assessments are equally confounding – with teachers from constituent colleges assessing students they have never taught. Ironically,end-semester exams are always conducted in time even though very few teachers bother to even cover half of the prescribed syllabus before exams. With this non-working culture at the university (except for the clichéd microscopic minority of teachers), students are left to fend for themselves academically. It is all the more painful since post-graduation is a crucial stage where both theoretical and practical learning should acquire depth, breadth and relative specialization.It is well known that there is a long-running culture of non-attendance and/or low attendance especially in higher education institutions in Manipur. Leaving the discussions on this absentee culture for some other day, the fault however lies equally with all stakeholders – teachers, government authorities, parents and students themselves. However, to the serious learners, the conspicuous non-teaching tradition at DMU, and the prevailing air of a near-derelict indifference among the authorities are extremely disconcerting.Established recently, DMU is allegedly beset with different challenges – financial, personnel, managerial etc. However, it is incumbent upon the concerned authorities and the teachers to be magnanimous enough to set aside their problems and delink it from the teaching and learning process. They ought to ensure that learning activities never stop, and that the future of students is never jeopardized, however compelling the circumstances. At a time when Indian universities are faring miserably in global rankings, one wonders where DMU even stands in the higher education environs of North East India.This letter is written without malice to anyone, but with a growing despondency as a guardian struggling to provide quality education for my wards. It is high time we witnessed this varsity’s sincere intent to rectify its most basic flaws since its establishment. Otherwise, all the tedious and tall claims of equitable access to quality education will remain a chimera of sorts. Putting the subject of quality teaching aside, it is hoped that DMU will at least start conducting full post-graduate classes soon to gain some semblance of a true higher education institution.Yours,K Bipin SinghSagolband, Imphal West."
The-crucial-question-is-whether-Manipur-has-learnt-any-lesson-during-the-last-ten-months-of-violence-or-not-N,"The crucial question is whether Manipur has learnt any lesson during the last ten months of violence or not. No clear cut answer here, but what is clear is the emergence of numerous power centres, each with its own set of agenda, but emerging all in the name of doing something for the people and the place. And power centres emerge or arise only when the necessary vacuum is created. Nearly one year since the clash erupted in all its ugliness in the evening of May 3, 2023 and New Delhi and Imphal continue to grope in the dark, not knowing what formula or step should be taken to restore normalcy. In as much as the common people are confused, not knowing when normalcy will actually return, the political leaders of the day too seem lost. Forget about the return of normalcy, the disturbing point is, there is nothing to suggest that some steps are being taken up to explore the possibility of helping Manipur take her first step towards normalcy. This is what is hard to digest and lest one forgets,  Imphal and New Delhi should not interpret the lull in confrontation and clash as peace returning. And peace should be understood beyond the realm of the ongoing ethnic clash but within the context of the daily life of the people. No one seems to know when violence will erupt constraining the people to come out on the streets and throw their own understood sense of security around their settlements. No one seems to know what steps the Government is studying to restore normalcy and who Imphal is consulting to break the impasse. It should however be clear to everyone that any effort to restore normalcy will run into a dead end as long as one side of the party in the conflict continues to stick to slogans such as ‘Solution First, Peace Later.’ One wonders whether such a stand has been highlighted to New Delhi and the Central leaders or not, but this is a point which Imphal should have taken note of and accordingly highlighted to the people concerned. And if the past is any indication, Manipur too, like the rest of the Nation will be caught up in activities mainly related to the coming Parliamentary elections, and the question is whether the different political parties, particularly the big two-BJP and the Congress-will sing the same tune in so far as the ongoing clash is concerned, or whether this will be used to deliver a point or two against the other. Will the BJP continue to hark back on ‘the misdeeds of the past Governments’ meaning the Congress and will the Congress go on the offensive against the failure of the BJP led Government to rein in the situation ? This is but one distinct possibility and in a way the maturity and mentality of the candidates and the parties concerned will be reflected on how it deals with the issue in their bid to earn the support of the people.Let it be very clear. The issue confronting the people and the place should not be seen through the narrow prism of political divides. It should also not be used to earn the sympathy and by extension the support of the people at the hustings. Ideally the BJP and the Congress should be talking the same language and the first priority should be on how to restore normalcy to Manipur. This is not the time to take political mileage or in the present context, election mileage, and the focus of everyone should be on how to make Manipur take her first step towards normalcy. Let the people also set down the agenda and make it clear to the candidates and the political parties they represent that the first priority at the moment is a roadmap to restore normalcy. Let the different political parties and the candidates also contribute their thoughts on how to make the idea of Manipur all encompassing, meaning how Manipur as an idea will appeal to people of different communities.  For too long this idea has not been taken to the political level, and perhaps the best time is now, in the run up to an election. It is also time for the people to embrace the reality that the Parliamentary election is not just an election to decide which party grabs power at New Delhi, but is about deciding who gets to represent Manipur and her people on the floor of Parliament. This is election year and this is the best opportunity for the people to demonstrate that much more is expected from the political parties and the candidates and perhaps the first question to be raised is what steps the political parties and the candidates intend to do to restore normalcy without hurting the interests of Manipur in any way."

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-21-How-many-parts-of-lotus-plants-are-edible-It-is-this-simple-curiosit,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 21 : How many parts of lotus plants are edible ? It is this simple curiosity coupled with the desire to be self reliant which led to the establishment of Yokchabi Enterprises, a food processing business which makes lotus tea, Thambou chips (lotus stem chips) and a variety of other items.Speaking to The Sangai Express, founder of Yokchabi Enterprises Hijam Ranjana said that she started her business in 2021 to be self-reliant. Ranjana (48) is a resident of Kongba Ucheckon and she started her food processing at her residence as the workshed.She is married to Atom Hemanta and the couple has two children, one son and a daughter.Saying that she encountered different obstacles at the initial stage of her business, Ranjana continued that she gained many valuable lessons on food processing after attending a training programme organised by Central Agricultural University (CAU).Ranjana said that she started selling Thambou chips which cost Rs 10 per packet at the neighbourhood shops.Saying that she now produces Thambou chips which cost upto Rs 80 per packet with better packaging quality, the entrepreneur maintained that she also sells her items at Delhi outlets with the help of the Horticulture  Department.Apart from Thambou chips, Yokchabi Enterprises also produces Thambou seasoning powder, dry fruit candy, plain and spicy cassava (u-mangra) chips and a mixture of Thambou, coconut and dry fruits among many other food items.Ranjana said that Yokchabi Enterprises has also launched a lotus tea but  proper marketing hasn't been done as of yet.Saying that she buys the lotus stem from Waithou, Mayang Imphal, Bishnupur and fruits from Ukhrul, Senapati and Mao, Ranjana added that the raw materials (thambal 108) for lotus tea come from Sendra.Thambal 108 is more aromatic, she said.Ranjana said that there is shortage of raw material as lotus plants are not harvested at many places.Saying that Yokchabi Enterprises mostly sells its products in Imphal East and Imphal West, Ranjana added that she makes about Rs 2000 to Rs 3000 on average daily.She said that she is targeting to increase her selling capacity to Rs 5000 daily.Yokchabi Enterprises employs six people and they get Rs 300 a day at the lowest, she added.Ranjana is the beneficiary of the Vocal for Local scheme of the Horticulture Department."
NEW-DELHI-Dec-13The-Parliament-security-breach-on-Wednesday-was-well-coordinated-meticulously-planned-and,"NEW DELHI, Dec 13The Parliament security breach on Wednesday was well-coordinated, meticulously planned and carried out by six accused, five of whom have been nabbed, police sources said on Wednesday.Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D who were held inside the Lok Sabha chamber, and Amol Shinde and Neelam -- caught outside Parliament -- are in police custody.Lalit and Vikram are suspected to be their accomplices while Vikram has been detained from Gurugram, Delhi Police teams have been sent to various locations to nab Lalit, sources said.Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by MPs.Around the same time, Amol Shinde and Neelam sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting slogans ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside the Parliament premises.Police sources said the Parliament security breach was a well-planned and well-coordinated incident carried out by six people, all of whom were in contact with each other over Instagram and other social media platforms where they hatched the plan.The accused devised the plan a few days ago and they carried out a recce before coming to Parliament on Wednesday, they said. ""Five of them stayed at Vikram's residence in Gurugram before coming to the Parliament. As per the plan, all six wanted to go inside the Parliament but only two got passes,"" the source said.Interrogation of Amol Shinde revealed that the six accused had known each other for the past four years through social media. ""They had the same ideology and hence decided to give a message to the government.The security agencies are trying to ascertain if they were instructed by anyone or any organisation. During interrogation, Amol said they were upset with issues like the farmers' protest, Manipur crisis, unemployment, that's why they committed this act,"" a police source told PTI.           PTI"
Sivakumar-Vijayaraghavalu-PhD-Honey-a-golden-elixir-produced-by-bees-from-the-nectar-of-flowers-has-been,"Sivakumar Vijayaraghavalu (PhD)Honey, a golden elixir produced by bees from the nectar of flowers, has been revered across civilizations for millennia, not just as a sweetener but as a potent medicine. Its therapeutic virtues, documented in ancient texts and validated by modern science, offer a harmonious blend of natural remedy and scientific wonder. This article aims to demystify the medicinal benefits of honey, presenting a narrative that captivates the layman's curiosity while satisfying the scientific reader's scrutiny.A Natural AntibioticHoney's most celebrated property is its ability to act as a natural antibiotic. This is largely attributed to its unique composition: a low water content and high acidity level create an inhos- pitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen peroxide, produced when honey is diluted by bodily fluids, offers antiseptic properties. Studies have shown that honey can effectively inhibit the growth of harmful pathogens, making it a valuable ally in wound healing and infection prevention.The Soother of Coughs and Throat IrritationsThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes honey as a demulcent, a substance that relieves irritation of the mucous membranes in the mouth by forming a protective film. Its effectiveness in soothing coughs and throat irritations has been substantiated by clinical trials, which have found honey to be as effective, if not more so, than over-the-counter cough remedies, especially in children.An Antioxidant PowerhouseHoney is rich in antioxidants, including phenolic acids and flavonoids, which scavenge free radicals, reducing oxidative stress in the body. This antioxidant capacity contributes to a range of health benefits, from anti-inflammatory effects to the reduction of risk factors for heart disease. Regular consumption of honey has been linked to improved heart health markers, such as reduced levels of LDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) and triglycerides, as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol (""good"" cholesterol).A Natural Source of EnergyAs a carbohydrate-rich food, honey is an excellent source of natural energy. Its fructose and glucose are quickly absorbed by the body, providing an immediate energy boost. This makes honey an ideal pre-or post-workout snack for athletes and fitness enthusiasts, aiding in endurance and recovery.Enhancing Digestive HealthHoney's prebiotic properties—the ability to feed beneficial gut bacteria—support healthy digestion and may combat digestive issues such as diarrhea and ulcers. Manuka honey, in particular, has been researched for its effective- ness against Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium linked to stomach ulcers. Further, Honey is beneficial for various gastrointestinal disor- ders beyond just ulcers and diarrhea. It has been used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and could potentially protect the gut lining against damage from alcohol and certain drugs. Its anti-inflammatory properties can soothe the eso- phagus and protect against damage caused by acid reflux.Immune System BoostHoney's antioxidant and antibacterial properties contribute to its ability to strengthen the immune system. Regular consumption of honey, especially raw and unprocessed varieties, can stimulate the production of immune cells, helping the body to fight off infections more effectively. The antioxidants in honey, particularly in darker varieties, can also reduce inflammation and protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.A Natural Remedy for Seasonal AllergiesSome studies suggest that local honey, which contains pollen from local plants, can help desensitize the body to these allergens, reducing the symptoms of seasonal allergies. The theory is that consuming honey acts similarly to a natural vaccine: by introducing small amounts of pollen into the body, the immune system can gradually learn to tolerate them, lessening the severity of allergic reactions over time.Sleep AidHoney can be a helpful ally in promoting restful sleep. Consuming honey before bedtime can help in the release of melatonin in the brain because it increases insulin levels, which in turn releases serotonin. Serotonin is then converted to melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Additionally, the natural sugar in honey may slightly raise insulin levels, allowing tryptophan (the compound famous for causing sleepiness after eating turkey) to enter the brain more easily, thereby promoting sleep.Wound Healing and Burns : Honey is not only antibacterial but also maintains a moist wound con- dition, and its high viscosity helps to provide a protective barrier to prevent infection. Its effectiveness in treating burns and wounds has been demonstrated in numerous studies, with honey speeding up the healing process and reducing infection. The anti- inflammatory properties of honey also reduce pain and irritation associated with wounds and burns.Reduction of Chemotherapy Side EffectsEmerging research suggests that honey may have a role in alleviating side effects associated with che- motherapy, such as mucositis, a painful inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract. Honey's anti-inflammatory and wound- healing properties can offer relief and improve the quality of life for patients under- going cancer treatment.Skin Care and Dermatological ApplicationsThe application of honey extends beyond internal health benefits to dermatological care. Its moistu- rizing, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties make it an excellent natural remedy for a variety of skin conditions, including acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Ho-ney masks and topical applications can promote skin healing and rejuvenation.A Word of CautionDespite its myriad benefits, honey is not suitable for everyone. Infants under one year of age should not consume honey due to the risk of botulism. Individuals with allergies to bee products should also exercise caution.Bridging Tradition and ScienceThe medicinal benefits of honey, spanning from antimicrobial properties to antioxidative effects, represent a compelling synergy between traditional wisdom and scientific validation. Its versatility as a natural remedy and dietary supplement underscores the importance of integrating natural products into our healthcare and wellness practices.In conclusionHoney, with its myriad medicinal properties, serves as a bridge between the realms of natural remedies and scientific endorsement. Its ability to act as a natural antibiotic, soothe coughs, provide antioxidants, and enhance digestive health, among other benefits, showcases the profound impact of nature's bounty on human health. As modern research continues to explore and validate the therapeutic uses of honey, it reinforces the wisdom of ancient practices, reminding us of the importance of preserving and integrating natural products into our healthcare regimen.In embracing the benefits of honey, we also acknowledge the need for respon- sible consumption and consideration of individual health conditions, underscoring the balance between natural efficacy and safety. Honey's role in traditional and modern medicine exemplifies the timeless value of natural remedies, offering a sweet path to health and wellness that is as delicious as it is beneficial.As we continue to explore the depths of nature's pharmacy, honey stands out as a testament to the intricate connections between the environment, health, and well-being, inviting both laypeople and the scientific community to appreciate and harness its potential for a healthier future.The writer is an INNOVATOR AWARDEE – From Cleveland Clinic Foundation (#2 rank in the world), Cleveland, Ohio, USA Associate Professor, Department of Life Sciences (Zoology), Manipur University (Central University), Manipur, India and can be reached at[email protected];[email protected]"

This-is-a-powerful-statement-but-it-is-still-not-clear-whether-this-was-said-out-of-conviction-or-out-of-the-g,"This is a powerful statement but it is still not clear whether this was said out of conviction or out of the growing pressure from the different but powerful civil society organisations. What however is clear is that this is the first time that Chief Minister N Biren has gone public with the proclamation that the Centre has been asked to withdraw partisan Central forces, which have come to be increasingly seen as molly coddling the Kuki militants and the CSOs which have openly declared a war against Manipur. Or could it be a case of the Chief Minister having received some encouraging signs from New Delhi to open up against the conduct of the Central security force personnel, particularly the Assam Rifles ? Important questions and the very fact that these posers are being raised here should reflect the reality. It is not without reason why the fingers of accusation have been raised against the Central security personnel, particularly the Assam Rifles. One can still recall an instance of the State police engaged in a stand off with Assam Rifles personnel after their vehicle was blocked ostensibly while in pursuit of some Kuki militants. Who or which organisation is best placed to answer how sophisticated arms like sniper rifles came into the hands of Kuki militants ? How well placed are the Kuki militants to attack State security personnel with sophisticated arms at Moreh ? Who is tasked with the job of guarding the Indo-Myanmar border ? The answers to these should tell its own story, and this is where the announcement of the Chief Minister that the Centre has been asked to withdraw partisan Central forces should be seen and understood. How did Kuki militants manage to cross the so called buffer zone sometime in the earlier part of the ongoing conflict and kill sleeping villagers, including a father-son duo at Bishnupur district ? Whose idea was it to draw the buffer zones ? Who is tasked with the law and order subject in the hills ? The very fact that these questions are being raised right now should tell its own story and the public announcement of the Chief Minister should be seen and understood in the context of the questions raised right now. Compulsion of geo-politics as understood within the context of the growing influence of China over Myanmar ? And make Manipur the price to be paid ? Things certainly does not look good at all, but this should not and cannot justify the price that Manipur has had to pay.Manipur has reasons to be angry. May 3, 2023 to January 23, 2024 and it is already more than 8 months since the violence erupted in all its ugliness. Over 200 people have been killed on either side, thousands have been rendered homeless, hundreds of houses have been levelled to the ground and many more are still missing. Yet Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not deemed it proper to even utter a word, save for the anguish he expressed when the video clip of two girls being paraded in the nude went viral on the social media. This is one reason for the growing disenchantment with the BJP led Government at Imphal and the mounting pressure on the Chief Minister and the BJP Ministers and MLAs can only be imagined. Yet it was no one less than Union Home Minister Amit Shah who informed Parliament that the Chief Minister is doing what ought to be done. One hopes it is with this belief and conviction that Delhi takes the proclamation of the Chief Minister against the Central security forces that they are partisan in the present conflict. There has to be a reason why there is a growing distrust between the people of Manipur and the Central security personnel and any Government worth its salt should have studied this from the very beginning. Why is there the general perception that the Central security forces, particularly the Assam Rifles has given the long rope to the Kuki militants ? How is it that sophisticated weapons such as sniper rifles are in the possession of Kuki militants ? Or should one buy the story of ‘village volunteers’ and believe that they can wield a sniper rifle ?

He continued that while on a drive to MM Gas at Lamphel, AIMS volunteers came across a non functional weighing machine and alleged that such practices have robbed the consumers of their rights to even verify if they are getting their money's worth while buying the gas cylinders.During the drive, many gas agencies were found having old cylinders, some of which were even leaking, he claimed.He conveyed that sources from some of the gas agencies told the AIMS volunteers that more often than not, many of the refilled gas cylinders given to the agencies from Sekmai Bottling Plant, were found to be old cylinders which were applied with a fresh coat of paint.Stating that this is a major factor of leaking gas cylinders, he said that the sources also informed that when they go to replace the old cylinders at the bottling plant, they are charged extra.Stressing on the danger posed by selling such types of gas cylinders to the consumers, not to mention violation of the rights of the consumers, the vice president demanded the CAF&PD Minister to do the needful immediately."

Binika shared the travails of the long path she trod- from being diagnosed with TB, going through the TB treatment, fighting the side effects of medicines as well as the haunting and daunting stigma, to eventually getting cured, and then, a few years later becoming a district TB officer herself.It is noteworthy to mention that Binika had also addressed the world leaders at the 2023 United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on TB and called upon them to make TB programmes more people-centered and inclusive. Currently she is on her way to complete her postgraduate degree course of Public Health in Nepal.The rollercoaster ride“I had just begun my Bachelor of Public Health degree course at the age of 18. But the excitement of new beginnings lasted for just over a month when symptoms of TB cast their shadow. TB is a social disease and is heavily stigmatized in countries like Nepal. I hoped against hope that my symptoms were not related to TB but to some other health issue. However, diagnosis in healthcare institutions confirmed TB. Then I was put on TB treatment,” shared Binika.Binika was speaking in End TB Dialogues, #90for90 #GlobalVoices series with Kalpana Acharya, former President of Nepal Health Journalists Forum and Shobha Shukla, Managing Editor of CNS.She added: “Barely a week into the anti-TB therapy, severe side effects began affecting me.

IMPHAL-Oct-6-Thangmeiband-MLA-Kh-Joykisan-has-urged-all-the-BLOs-engaged-in-voter-identification-for-the-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 6: Thangmeiband MLA Kh Joykisan has urged all the BLOs engaged in voter identification for the Constituency to be sincere in their work and register only those who are real residents of the Constituency.He further warned against any malpractice in the process by enrolling people who do not belong to the Constituency and threatened to take up necessary legal action against such officials.Speaking to media persons at his residence at Khoyathong today, Joykisan said that the role of the electors are huge as they are the ones responsible for choosing the leaders.But now, an issue has cropped up wherein it is becoming increasingly necessary to determine whether the electors are genuine or not. This requires all the stakeholders, namely the Government, election office, public and the CSOs to come together and work out a solution, he said.Announcing that he will take responsibility of the voter identification work for Thangmeiband, Joykisan said that no individual whose origin is a mystery as well as those from other Constituency, cannot be enlisted in the voter list for Thangmeiband.On the other hand, he urged all other MLAs to minutely check the influx of non locals into their respective Constituency, explaining that once they are enlisted in the voter list, removing them will be near impossible.He also appealed to the CEO, DCs, SDOs, SDCs, BLOs and all the officials concerned to perform their duties to prevent any malpractice in the voter registration process.Failure to do so will make them the enemy of the common people, he warned.Nowadays, there are not many left to voice concerns over the safety of the indigenous people. Even the MLAs are powerless to do anything, he claimed.The MLA alleged that following the NRC, many non locals have started flooding into the State  and added that if CAB comes, then the future of the indigenous people is doomed.Joykisan lauded the people of Mizoram and their strength due to which Union Home Minister Amit Shah was unable to utter a single statement on CAB in their State recently.However, in the case of Manipur, many will come forward claiming that CAB is a positive thing when BJP National leaders visit the State. However, no one is able to boycott these parties or individuals, he alleged.Speaking about Babysana's case, the MLA expressed disappointment that now, the people and the CSOs seem to have abandoned the cause and the demand for justice for Babysana.He continued that even though Chief Minister N Biren Singh, during the Assembly session, assured to go personally to New Delhi to ensure the case is taken up  by the CBI,  no positive action has been seen till date which is rather unfortunate.In the face of such a failure, it will be the sole responsibility of the State Government, not the people, when any form of violence or unwanted incidents erupt concerning the issue, Joykisan cautioned.Accusing the State Government of siding with the school authorities, Joykisan said that the five people who are currently jailed, are in there for a reason.Why is the Government reluctant to minutely investigate the case, he further asked."
6-more-with-no-travel-history-test-positive,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Jul 24: Fear of community transmission looms large as more and more people with no travel history have been tested positive for COVID-19 in the last few days. As many as 32 people including 11 Assam Rifles personnel, a doctor and a shopkeeper at Thoubal bazar have tested positive for the virus today. At least six of the cases have no travel history.The State's COVID-19 tally has reached 2147 with 656 active cases. 1491 have recovered from the disease and the State's recovery rate now stands at 69.44 per cent.The doctor who tested COVID-19 positive today hails from Lilong Turel Ahanbi, Thoubal district and was posted at Senapati. Health authorities are suspecting that the doctor may have contracted the virus when attending patients at home, sources said.In addition to the doctor, four more from Thoubal district (including the shopkeeper) who have no travel history also tested positive today, as per a report of the COVID-19 Common Control Room.With the detection of the cases with no travel history at Thoubal, there is apprehension among the people in the district about the possibility of a community outbreak. It may be noted that the health authorities and the district administration are on high alert in the district and have started door to door rapid antigen testing of suspected cases who had close contact with known COVID-19 positive patients. It may be noted here that two Pradhans of Gram Panchayats in the district had also tested positive for the virus recently.Meanwhile considering the grim situation in Thoubal district, a State technical experts' committee meeting chaired by Health Director, K Rajo was held today, said sources.The meeting resolved to enhance contact tracing and step up all efforts for containing the virus spread in the district.The committee also noted the need for a separate SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for COVID-19 in the State and separate quarantine centres and COVID-19 Care Centres for the CRPF/BSF and Assam Rifles personnel.An earlier report of COVID-19 Common Control Room showed that 31 persons including 29 males and 2 females tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.The cases were detected at RIMS (11 cases), Jiribam (11), JNIMS (5), Thoubal (4). They belong to Imphal West (11), 37 Assam Rifles, Jiribam (11), Thoubal (5), Ukhrul (2), Churachandpur (1) and Imphal East (1).Six of the cases including four from Thoubal and two from Imphal West have no travel history.

They were found COVID-19 free on RT PCR test, added the report.Moreover, following the rise in the number of cases with no travel history, the Government had announced a strict 7 days lockdown till July 30 in a bid to flatten the infection curve. If the number of infection does not come down and the situation in districts does not improve, the lockdown may be extended by 7 more days, said sources."
One-hopes-the-Chief-Minister-is-not-jumping-the-gun-in-proclaiming-that-the-decision-to-fence-the-Indo-Myanmar,"One hopes the Chief Minister is not jumping the gun in proclaiming that the decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and do away with the Free Movement Regime (FMR) would prove to be a permanent solution to myriad of problems besetting Manipur. Border fencing and doing away with FMR would certainly go a long way in keeping out illegal immigrants from across the border, but this cannot be the panacea to the present issue besieging the State. Apparent that New Delhi seems intent on checking incursion from across the border, but how about the illegal immigrants who have already crossed into Manipur and are today laying ancestral claims on religious sites such as Mt Thangjing and Mt Koubru, much less enjoying the benefits of being tagged Scheduled Tribes ? How about the impunity in which armed militants of the Kuki-Zo group have been targeting villages at the foothills across the State ? So far New Delhi has not spoken a word about the SoO pact signed with the Kuki-Zo militant groups and this is a case that Imphal should seriously present before the Centre to have another hard, serious look at the pact which has been in force since 2008. Has Imphal ever put the question of why the SoO pact was inked in the first place with the Kuki militant groups back in 2005, before Manipur came on board in 2008 ? As some concerned people, people whose line of thinking are assets to Manipur,  have put it, why was the SoO pact signed when the Kuki militants were never known to have trained their guns on the security force ? Their only claim to infamy was imposing taxes and letting their writ run on the National Highways, threatening transporters and drivers and collecting taxes. Why was such a pact signed with a bunch of highwaymen ? These are points which Imphal should study seriously and work out a model in such a way that these points can be put across in a manner acceptable in the corridors of power. At the same time, Imphal should also be aware of the ground reality and the larger objective which led to the signing of the SoO pact. When these points can be put forward convincingly before New Delhi, then perhaps the State Government may pat itself on the back for having put across the interests of Manipur convincingly. Let it be very clear. Border fencing and scrapping FMR can only be one part of the steps taken up to check illegal immigration into Manipur. It is only logical that this should be followed by more steps, such as enforcing the National Register of Citizens with 1951 as the base year. Identify all those who have entered the territory of Manipur on the sly, mark them out and make sure that they are not treated as legal citizens of the land. Border fencing and ending FMR can only mean putting in place mechanisms to check further incursion into the land, but it is equally important that those who entered on the sly earlier are identified and marked out.The very fact that a Kuki gentleman, a certain Paolienlal Haokip, had written back in 2002 in a think tank publication highlighting the plight of Burmese refugees in North East India, including Manipur. “Burmese refugees in the North Eastern region of India deserve greater attention, and their plight, which is worse than any other refugee situation in India, needs to be addressed with more concern....some 15,000 Konyak Nagas, 20,000 Kukis and 17000-20000 Chin and Reang tribals were driven out into the bordering States of Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram respectively.’ The writer here was referring to 1967 when the Burmese Government under Ne Win launched their Burmanisation programme (Operation Khadawmi). This was in 1967 and the writer also referred to the democratic uprising in Burma in 1988, which heightened the ‘forcible evacuation’. All illegal immigrants no doubt and add the incursion into Manipur after the military coup of 2021 and one can have a fair idea of the present situation and why the cry against illegal immigration has reached feverish pitch. This should also explain the emergence of several new settlements in the Reserved and Protected Forests of Manipur. This is why the Government of Manipur cannot rest easy with just the plan to fence the border and do away with FMR but also press for some measures to detect those who entered earlier and are today raising claims on the ancestral lands of the indigenous people of Manipur."

They also are vital symbol of not only the state of infrastructure and transport cum travel logistics of the nation but an important element of visual architectural landscape of the country.More than 2 crore Indians traverse through Indian stations each day, yet never before such an effort, as being done now, was put in place to modernize this essential part of Indian infrastructure and improve day to day travel experience of millions of its people.As India takes determined steps towards multi trillion dollar economy, mission of transformation of Railways stations, from being an accumulator of dirt, squalor and filth to being the clean bustling centers of comfortable travel, symbol of National pride and heritage andworld class conve- niences, is truly remarkable. The mission is already beginning to show astonishing results.These modernized railway stations are representative of a Nation that is not only modernizing fast but also a governance that cares for its citizens. Experiencing Indian Railways means experiencing India as a Nation as well.Before 2014, in the name of modernization, scattered efforts were being made to improve passenger amenities and improve the façade of very few busy railway stations, with no visibility. After 2014, redevelopment of railway stations across India became a priority agenda of Ministry of Railway. This agenda is now being driven with full force by the Government.Gandhinagar Railway station in Gujarat was the first station to undergo modernization in 2021. Later on, in the same year, Rani Kamlapati Railway Station (formerly known as Habibganj) was the first railway station on Indian Railways being redeveloped.In 2022, Union Cabinet approved redevelopment of 3 major railway stations-New Delhi Railway Station, Ahmedabad Railway Station and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Mumbai, with an approximate total investment of nearly Rs 10,000 Cr.(To be contd)"

We, as the Naga army, embody the spirit of a sacrificial offering, willingly volunteering to serve the noble cause of our National interests until our very last breath”, he added.General Ningkhan Shimray said this while addressing a gathering on the Naga Army Day at their general headquarters, Hebron off Dimapur.He said the occasion “symbolizes the essence of existence: as a revolutionary army, we stand as torchbearers of political conscious- ness, warriors for Christ, steadfastly championing the noble cause that resonates at the core of our collective aspirations, striving for a future steeped in justice and righteousness”.The Naga Army chief further said, “Today, as we pay homage to the martyred Naga army, we stand on the unwavering commitment they made, sacrificing their tomorrows for our brighter tomorrow under the sovereign Nation of the Nagas”.General Ningkhan then said they staunchly advocate for “our rights and the establishment of the kingdom of God. Ours is a movement rooted in the pursuit of freedom and a tireless struggle”.The chief of the Naga Army further said, “While we possess guns for self-defence, we recognize that these weapons do not define our strategy or shape our future. Instead, our trajectory hinges on political guidance, counsel, and advice from our esteemed party leaders, illuminating the path toward our destined destination. As dedicated soldiers aligned with a political party, our unwavering commitment resides in faithfully following the directives. Our unity thrives on the noble vision of Nagalim for Christ and the larger interests of the National party”.He also said that every action, strategy, or initiative “we undertake remains firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of our party”.Any endeavour straying from these principles mirrors an attempt to grasp power through force- an approach antithetical to “our ethos,” he added.The Naga Army chief also said that in their collective consciousness, nobody supersedes the sanctity of the Nation and the law-known as ""Azha""- nor stands beyond the bounds of the Constitution, termed ""Yezhabo"".He also said the moment “we falter” in upholding these foundational principles, “we regress” into a lawless, reactionary entity."

IMPHAL-Oct-9-Strongly-condemning-the-assault-and-public-shaming-of-a-man-and-a-woman-by-a-mob-at-Upokpi-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 9: Strongly condemning the assault and public shaming of a man and a woman by a mob at Upokpi Khunou, Bishnupur district on October 6 and that too in-front of the minor daughter of the woman, Women Against Crime has urged the people not to resort to mob violence in the future and instead to inform the police and let the law handle the situation.Speaking to media persons at the office of Women Against Crime at Canchipur today, its secretary A Robita Leima urged the State Government to pass stringent laws to check extramarital affairs.Regarding the unfortunate incident at RIMS, the organisation's advisor Soubam Sobita strongly condemned such heinous act and stated that it is extremely disappointing that the act occurred inside such a reputed hospital/institution.On the other hand, Women Action for Development has also condemned the incident of mob-violence and humiliation of a minor girl, who tried to defend her mother at Upokpi Khunou.Lamenting that the minor girl was publicly inquired by some locals thus creating serious psychological trauma, it continued that the association members were also asked by the club members and locals of Kha-Potshangbam to enquire the minor girl about the character of her mother but the organisation refused to do so.Urging the Government to give befitting punishment to all the culprits involved in the mob violence so as to ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future, it expressed gratitude to the Chief Minister and Bishnupur police for their speedy action. The organisation further appealed to the public not to take the law into their own hands or upload any video or photo that will harm the modesty of a person.Instead, take steps to lodge a formal complaint at the police station concerned, it urged."
Disposal-of-bodies-of-Covid-victims-by-IMCAllegations-of-high-charge-raised,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Dec 1 : In a surprising development, allegations that Imphal Municipal Corporation is imposing hefty charges for disposing bodies of COVID-19 victims have come to light.Speaking to media persons at Manipur Press Club today, cultural activist Rakesh Naorem alleged that IMC has imposed labour and cremation charges amounting Rs 15,000 from a family of those who died from COVID-19.While maintaining that imposing burdensome charges on the bereaved family instead of extending support is something undesirable, Rakesh drew the attention of the State Government to intervene in the matter.The State Government recently assured to bear costs of the precautionary measures taken in cremation of persons who died of COVID-19 and to reimburse the charges which were taken earlier. However contrary to it 'a Jamandar of IMC' had charged Rs 15,000 for cremating a COVID victim, Sanabam Tombi Singh (90) from Wangkhei Pukhrambam yesterday, he alleged.Spouse of one Sanasam Romeba (of Tentha Khongbal who also succumbed to the virus at JNIMS on November 2), had also earlier decried IMC for imposing the same amount for cremating her husband.Not only this, many people across the State have expressed their resentment over the issue, he continued while urging the State Government to lay out a comprehensive policy in view of the situation and not to add burden to the mourning family.He also appealed to the State Government to set up a COVID-19 specific cremation facility.Joining the press meet via video conference, the daughter of Sanabam Tombi Singh, who breathed his last at RIMS Hospital due to COVID-19 at around 7 pm of November 29, Dr Thaninleima questioned all concerned whether the corpse of an individual will be left unattended if the family of the deceased fails to manage the amount they are charging for cremation.Lamenting that the Government has not kept its word, she also appealed to the State Government to address the issue at the earliest.She also asked why it took so long for RIMS authority to report the death to the DC causing delay and inconvenience to the family in performing last rites.There is also a custom of fasting till the cremation  process is over, she reminded while urging all to ensure such delay in submitting report and delivery of the mortal remains do not happen in the future."
Takhellambam-NepolinElection-the-grandest-festival-of-democracy-stands-as-a-beacon-of-hope-amidst-the-comp,"Takhellambam NepolinElection, the grandest festival of democracy, stands as a beacon of hope amidst the complexities of conflict and uncertainty. As the forthcoming Lok Sabha election 2024 casts its shadow over Manipur, it heralds a pivotal moment in the State’s intricate journey. Beyond its political significance, this electoral extravaganza embodies a vibrant celebration of democracy, where every citizen assumes a vital role in shaping the future trajectory of our beloved Nation. It is a time when we unite to exercise our rights and responsibilities, ensuring our voices are heard, and the most capable leaders are chosen to guide our country towards progress and prosperity.Manipur grapples with a deep-seated conflict between the Meitei/Meetei and Chin-Kuki communities as the Nation gears up for the forthcoming elections. This strife has engulfed the region for the past ten months, leaving behind a trail of devastation. More than 200 lives have been lost, countless individuals are still missing, 70000 people have been displaced within their State, and 5000 sweet homes have turned into ashes. Despite concerted efforts by both the State Government and the Central authorities to mitigate the situation, the challenges remain daunting and seemingly impossible.  As bombs and bullets have now ceased to reverberate, the haunting echoes of grieving mothers and widows reverberate through the air, serving as a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict’s human cost. Though the physical violence may have subsided, the emotional scars and profound loss endured by affected families underscores the urgency for lasting peace and reconciliation in the region. Despite the gravity of the situation, a lasting solution remains elusive. Nevertheless, amidst this turmoil, the quiet approach of the election season makes its presence felt in Manipur.Unlike the last election cycle, when political parties were in full swing, organising rallies and launching vigorous campaigns to secure victory for their candidates this year, the scenario appears quite different in Manipur. The usual hustle and bustle of campaign gatherings and rallies are noticeably absent. Nevertheless, the political fervour remains palpable amidst the backdrop of conflict.Despite the lack of overt campaign activities, the pulse of politics beats strongly within the socio-political landscape of Manipur, underscoring the deep-rooted anticipation and engagement with the electoral process. Despite the absence of overt campaigning, the pulse of politics beats strongly, acknowledging the prevailing conflict while maintaining a palpable excitement for the impending electoral process.The Election Commission of India recently announced the dates for the Lok Sabha elections for Manipur, which are scheduled in two phases, 19th and 26th April. With the implementation of the Model Code of Conduct, the political landscape has swiftly transformed. Notably, the (Communist Party of India (CPI)  officially declared its candidates. Laishram Sotinkumar Singh has been formally proclaimed the Communist Party of India’s candidate for the Inner Parliamentary Constituency; in contrast, the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and main Opposition Indian National Congress are yet to make an official announcement.Conversely, an intriguing aspect emerges as many Manipuris express their intent to vote for candidates committed to fostering peace in Manipur and effectively representing the State’s concerns in Parliament.They emphasise the importance of electing individuals who are vocal about addressing grievances and advocating for Manipur’s interests rather than passive or inactive members. Regardless of educational background, what truly matters to voters is the candidate’s determination to speak up and engage in meaningful dialogue on behalf of the State.In the Outer Manipur Parliamentary Constituency, campaign activities and public gatherings have already commenced, signalling the onset of electoral fervour. As the political machinery gears up for the impending elections, anticipation runs high, with citizens eagerly awaiting the unveiling of candidates and the unfolding of campaign strategies. Amidst the current tumultuous situation in Manipur, a unified voice emerges from its people and various organisations, advocating for a pause or delay in the electoral process until and unless a concrete resolution is reached for the ongoing conflict.At this critical juncture, many argue that holding elections is not imperative. Instead, they emphasise the pressing need to address the underlying issues plaguing the State before proceeding with electoral activities. This unified call underscores the collective desire for stability and sustainable solutions before navigating the electoral path.Amid conflict, navigating the complex political landscape of Manipur during election season poses significant challenges. Despite the growing chorus for peace, this plea does not resonate with many. Instead, the quiet undercurrent of the electoral process often overshadows the call for resolution.While newspapers may report on election activities, there must be more presence in localities. The people of Manipur, however, are not swayed by the election fervour and are unwilling to participate in the festivities of campaign songs. Their focus remains steadfast on pursuing peace, emphasising the need for dialogue and reconciliation above all else. Whether Manipur remains a conflict zone or not, whether solutions are forthcoming, and even if peace eludes us, the Lok Sabha elections will undoubtedly proceed during these critical times.Elections are essential to democracy, allowing us to select representatives who will govern and uphold the nation. Therefore, the people of Manipur must cast their votes for individuals who are qualified and possess the courage to advocate Manipur’s interests vigorously in Parliament. Let us choose based on genuine conviction and thoughtful consideration rather than succumbing to external influences.By electing wisely, we can ensure that Manipur’s voice resonates loudly in the corridors of power. Now is the opportunity to rectify past mistakes and amplify Manipur’s voice throughout India."
Islamabad-Jan-31Former-Pakistan-prime-minister-Imran-Khan-and-his-wife-were-sentenced-Wednesday-to-14-years,"Islamabad, Jan 31Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife were sentenced Wednesday to 14 years in jail after being found guilty of graft in a case involving gifts he received while premier.The verdict, a week before national elections, comes a day after Khan was given a prison sentence of 10 years in a case related to leaking state secrets.""Another sad day in our judicial system history, which is being dismantled,"" a spokesperson for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party told media.It was not immediately clear if Khan's sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently following a trial held inside the jail where he has been detained for much of the time since his arrest in August.But Khan's lawyer Salman Safdar confirmed to AFP he had been sentenced alongside his wife, Bushra Bibi, who had been on remand throughout the trial.""Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi have been sentenced. Bushra Bibi has not been arrested as yet,"" Safdar said.The pair married in 2018, months before Khan was elected prime minister.Bibi, a faith healer who met Khan when he approached her for spiritual guidance, is rarely seen in public.About 127 million Pakistanis are eligible to vote on election day next Thursday, with Khan and PTI at the centre of debate despite being squeezed out of the limelight.The ballot has already been marred by allegations of rigging, with Khan barred from running over a previous graft conviction and his party subject to a massive crackdown.Since being ousted in 2022, Khan has been buried by court cases he claims have been triggered to prevent his return to office after a campaign of defiance against Pakistan's military kingmakers.Khan had accused the powerful military -- with whom he ruled in partnership for much of his tenure -- of orchestrating his ouster in a US-backed conspiracy.When Khan was first arrested in May last year, riots broke out across the country.But his street power was killed by a military crackdown that saw thousands of supporters detained -- 100 of whom are facing closed-door military trials -- and dozens of senior leaders forced underground.""You have to take revenge for every injustice with your vote on February 8,"" Khan said in a statement posted on his X profile reacting to his 10-year sentence on Tuesday.""Tell them that we are not sheep that can be driven with a stick.""

Free-ThinkerAs-per-the-latest-info-available-in-public-space-the-booty-of-electoral-bonds-went-approximately,"Free ThinkerAs per the latest info available in public space the booty of electoral bonds went–approximately 50% to the Ruling and another 50% to the Opposition (though fragmented). That means our rich responsible citizens are doing justice to the Bharat democracy which is the oldest in the world, older than the Athenian version. We had the bicameral system (rudimentary-type) in Vedic Age in the form of Sabha and Samiti. When Alexander landed here he encountered Republics run by egalitarian citizen-cum-warriors. The Balloting system in this country was as old as the Cholas. Let us talk about ancient Bharat Democracy some other day. Today let's concentrate on bonds ie, electoral bonds.How many of us had purchased electoral bonds and for how much money from the designated SBI and which parties were the beneficiaries ? We will come to know about all these sooner or later. But our predicament is–if nobody bought electoral bonds and parties received no fund–that would be ignominious for all of us in Manipur. That kind of situation is undesirable. At least some should have purchased e-bonds and given to a party or parties. I want to believe that we did and parties benefitted. We should always be part of the great democratic jamboree.One Shri Jha from Upper House said, “a private company was raided by ED and a few days later, it ended up buying electoral bonds, anybody can join the dots.” Yes, it could be. But, we are unable to join the dots, Jha ji may kindly do the needful.There is a possibility that if a Company or a rich person is raided by ED or IT – the same company or the person may purchase the bonds to save their money from future raids or repeated raids–and give those to a party with some understanding, so that the company or the person can redeem the same (even less ) later in cash or in kind. All donations and investments have meanings, if you read in between the lines.A Left leader utters, “it is clear that once they buy electoral bonds, the investigation against them is suspended, this is nothing but a clear cut case of political extortion.” Even if a Company is investigated by ED or IT or CBI that Company is not barred from buying electoral bonds and give the same to the Parties.It is also possible that in retaliation the concerned Company might have purchased humongous bonds and given those to the Opposition party. In anger and desperation such things might have happened too.We really don’t know who is extorting whom. The extortionists are very smart people, normally they don’t use crude methods. Mr Gandhi says, this is the world’s biggest extortion racket. Congress President demands freezing of BJP bank accounts.  Chidambaram says it is ‘legalized bribery’. These are the opinions expressed by the main Opposition party. Their earnings from the electoral bond system must be quite substantial though less than the Ruling Party. Their income is perhaps comparable with Trinamool, DMK ctc. If the grudge is about less bonds and less money–we don’t know what to say.As if BJP is the main beneficiary of electoral bonds – many people are shouting foul. But in reality all the Political parties have received bonds from the donors. Obviously the ruling party got more than them. It is human nature to be with the power that be (in most of the cases). People can’t be blamed for funding the BJP more than others. Are you sure that the Companies raided by ED and other Agencies purchased the bonds and gave those to BJP ? The recipients could be the Opposition parties too.In 2020, nearly 14 billion US dollars was spent on federal election campaigns in the United States – making it the most expensive campaign in US history.Following a number of Supreme Court verdicts – the very wealthy are now allowed to spend unlimited amounts on campaigns through Political Action Committees and also to prevent voters from knowing who is trying to influence them by contributing ‘dark money’ that masks the donor’s identity. Consequently, big money dominates US political campaigns to a degree not seen in decades and is drowning out the voices of ordinary Americans (Courtesy Wikipedia).Political funding is a big issue everywhere in the world. Similar controversies linger on in mature democracies too. Even in the United Kingdom and France the menace of political funding mars the true meaning of democracy.If there are shortcomings in our political funding system we need to improve upon it. Political parties need money– for election campaigns and also for running their party organization. Arun ji might have introduced it in good faith. Judiciary as obiter dicta may suggest a better, fairer and more transparent political funding system so that the lawmakers do the needful.Finally, the Apex Court Chief says, it is duty bound to give bond numbers (alphanumeric code). Only SBI can give the numbers. That will enable actual matching between the donors with the recipients. As of now we have only one Bond number in public domain that is 007 (MI6)."

KOHIMA-Dec-8-The-NSCN-IM-has-reiterated-its-demand-for-a-separate-Flag-and-a-separate-Constitution-for-th,"KOHIMA, Dec 8The NSCN (IM) has reiterated its demand for a separate Flag and a separate Constitution for the Naga people as part of the peace talks. It also said that the backtracking of the Centre on the matter is being viewed as a betrayal of trust.In a statement the outfit said that the Centre has wandered away from the Framework Agreement that was signed with them in 2015. The NSCN (IM) claimed that the Indian representative had initially agreed upon the matter of a separate Flag and Constitution, but later backtracked on the commitment.The NSCN (IM) statement read, ""Despite Government of India's wavering stand, nothing could be further from the truth as Flag and Constitution are the integral parts of sovereignty. Sovereignty without Flag and Constitution is a form without content. Nagas have been in existence for thousands of years in their own land in accordance with our own set of law.""The NSCN (IM) further said that the Framework Agreement of 2015 agrees upon the unique history and position of the Nagas and also delves into the concept of shared sovereignty between the Nagas and the Government of India.""The Framework Agreement reiterates the unique history and position of the Nagas. The concepts of shared-sovereignty and co-existence have also been explained therein. It says, ""in democracy, sovereignty lies with the people, ""which implies that sovereignty of the Nagas is with the Naga people. It is pertinent to reproduce here the very clause mentioned in the draft prepared by the Government of India: ""In the matters of her own affairs, as mutually agreed upon, Nagaland shall be sovereign. The agreement shall cover all Naga areas,"" read the statement.The NSCN (IM), further said in the statement, that they no longer view Indians as enemies but believe in the concept of peaceful coexistence.""We no longer view the Indians as our enemy in the light of peaceful coexistence. But we cannot sacrifice our National principle for the sake of buying friendship. Significantly, the Framework Agreement mentions, 'Co-existence of the two entities sharing sovereign power.' It means-Indians and Nagas will coexist as two entities on the basis of equality and mutual respect of rights as clearly stated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This Framework Agreement addresses the sovereign rights of the Nagas and their future as well as the security and commercial interests of India. This historic agreement is seen and appreciated by many international peacemakers as the roadmap to a lasting peace in the Indian sub-continent,"" read the NSCN (IM) statement.The NSCN (IM) further said that the backtracking of the Centre on the issue of a separate Flag and Constitution for the Nagas is being viewed as a betrayal of trust.""Unfortunately, what has begun with much fanfare is now going the way of ""betrayal of trust"" because of the lack of sincerity on the part of the Indian Government. This has created huge trust deficit and disillusionment among the people. Friends and critics often said the Government of India is playing with time to diminish the hard-earned Framework Agreement. But that will be too costly. The ball is in the court of Government of India,"" said the NSCN (IM) statement.The NSCN (IM) further said that these issues continue to act as stumbling blocks as ""the last round of Indo-Naga formal talk that took place on 14th November, 2023, in Delhi is not conclusive but not a deadlock either.""India TodayNE"

Sir-In-democracy-more-specifically-Indian-democracy-which-is-called-the-largest-democracy-in-the-world-mut,"Sir,In democracy, more specifically Indian democracy which is called the largest democracy in the world, mutual respect and honour is the guiding principle of command and confidence not based on the post one holds but based on moral principle of equality and justice.You are always spearheading extermination of terrorism. While you are advocating anti-terrorism propaganda for the cause of Gandhian Ahimsa, your silence signals being unconcerned about the Kuki narco-terrorism violence including incendiarism and indiscriminate killings of innocent villagers and farmers. It is not a good omen for you to turn a deaf ear and play mute when your own people are being attacked indiscriminately by the alien Kuki narco-terrorists.You are required to come to the rescue of the suffering Meeteis.You are watching something which is not permitted by rule of law. As a leader of the country you must rise to the occasion to protect your people from the foreign invasion. This is not the time for political game.Your advocacy of anti-terrorism is laudable because you command confidence of the people by recognising Pakistan as a terrorist country. As Head of GOI your utter silence on the genocidal crimes of Kuki narco-terrorists is unacceptable. A Government must act and not merely watch.Kuki narco-terrorists burn homes to ashes and more than 60,000 Meeteis are homeless. Many unarmed Meeteis were killed by these devils. It is a great challenge to a civilised Government and as such, this critical situation full of woes and sufferings should not be left unattended to. Food, medicine, shelter and other necessary items are provided by massive contribution without any support from the Government as well.The need of the hour is to bring peace and normalcy in Manipur.1. Suspension of Operation pact turns to be lawlessness and the Indian might should exhibit its eagerness for the containment of lawlessness created by Kuki-terrorists.2. Since Myanmarese Kuki narco-terrorists are involved, the Central Armed Forces should be directly engaged in counter-terrorism to completely fulfil their mission in no time.3. State security forces must be stationed at regular intervals of vulnerable areas providing security and protection to the local villagers, farmers and cultivators who are working in the fields.4. Those illegal Kuki migrants who infiltrated into Manipur should be identified and deported to their homeland, Myanmar Chin Hills.5. As long as these devilish narco-terrorists haunt, peace and normalcy will be a far cry.6. Any claim for separate administration or Kuki homeland in Manipur is illogical and hence unattainable. They should be given appropriate outlet in accordance with their characteristic savagery.7. The past glory of Meetei Kingdom whose accounts were left attended to by the Western writers and Meetei scriptural texts had been structured on the superstructure of a Meetei Nation-State.Yours faithfully,Haobam Indrakumar,Imphal"
Yengkhom-Devajit-Dr-Robert-Panmei-Dr-Salam-Dilip-and-Dr-RS-LoushambamEvery-year-the-21st-of-March-is-cele,"Yengkhom Devajit, Dr Robert Panmei, Dr Salam Dilip and Dr RS LoushambamEvery year, the 21st of March is celebrated as ‘International Day of Forest’. The International Day of Forest is being observed as a global effort to promote awareness about the significance and contributions of the forests for the sustenance of life on earth. The International Day of Forest formerly known as World Forestry Day was instituted in November 1971 after a voting at the 16th session of the Conference of Food and Agriculture Organization. Even though this is an excellent initiative, it couldn’t raise an effective awareness in every individual. By realizing the role of forests in reducing carbon emissions, a conference was held in 2007 and it helped to develop momentum for the next step. It was a fruitful event and attracted many members of Government agencies and NGOs. From 2007 to 2012, the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Indonesia organised a series of 6 Forest days in different parts of the world. In 2012, the year next to the declaration of 2011 as the International Year of Forest in the Ninth Session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF-9) held in New York, the United Nations General Assembly voted to formalize International Day of Forests with proper theme containing clear objective for every year to raise awareness of various types of forest. The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 21st March the International Day of Forests in 2012.The theme of the International Day of Forest, 2024 is “Forests and Innovation : New Solutions for a Better World”. With innovation and advancement in technology the monitoring of forests has been transformed, helping Nations to observe and report on their forests more efficiently. Indeed, the fight against deforestation necessitates new developments in technology. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation and restoring and managing forests sustainably are essential steps to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030.Every year an area of 10 million hectares is lost due to deforestation and an area of approximately 70 million hectares is affected by forest fires. Therefore, these innovations are crucial for the development of sustainable commodity production, early warning systems, and the empowerment of Indigenous Peoples through land mapping and access to climate finance (Climate finance refers to financial resources and instruments that are used to support action on climate change). An example of such innovation is AIM4Forests (Accelerating Innovative Monitoring for Forests).It is a five-year program jointly operated by FAO and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The program aims to enhance forest monitoring through modern technologies, technical innovation, and utilising space data and remote sensing. Moreover, while overcoming the challenges of sustainable wood products, ecosystem restoration including reforestation initiatives, can also considerably improve food security and climate change mitigation. It can be considered literally as enhancing food security and mitigating climate change while promoting sustainable wood products. FAO described that Innovation can help to restore, protect, manage and use forests sustainably.Technological, social, policy, institutional and financial innovations are key to ensuring the sustainable supply and use of forest ecosystem services. From construction to medicine, innovations in forest products are helping create alternatives to unsustainable materials such as concrete, steel, plastics and synthetic fibres, while sustainable wood products store carbon for their lifetime.Lastly, it is necessary to protect, preserve, conserve and sustainably manage the forest because of the reason that forestsharbouraround 1.6 billion people worldwide, forests are home to many threatened and endemic species, and since 1960 onwards 30% of diseases have been attributed to land use change mainly deforestation. Forests also act as regulators and supporters of the environment. As per the Global Forest Review, the forest of the world stores approximately 861 gigatonnes of carbon, with 44% in soil, 42% in live biomass, 8% in dead wood and 5% in litter could be cited as example of the role of forest for mitigating global climate change.Additionally, ecosystem restoration, including reforestation efforts, can significantly contribute to climate mitigation and enhance food security while pushing the boundaries of sustainable wood products. and enhance food security while promoting sustainable wood products. So, let us encourage the conservation of forests for a better tomorrow.The writers are with the Department of Forestry, Manipur University"

Barely-24-hours-after-Chief-Minister-N-Biren-made-another-bold-statement-asking-the-people-to-entrust-the-resp,"Barely 24 hours after Chief Minister N Biren made another bold statement asking the people to entrust the responsibility of protecting the State’s unity and integrity to the government, two young lives were cut short at Kadangband. Since May 2023, fierce battles have been going on in different areas of the state between two forces; one determined to break up Manipur to create an exclusive political domain of Kuki-Zo people and the other committed to uphold and protect the integrity of Manipur at all costs. In the course of the nine months old fighting, hundreds of people, mostly youth have been killed, thousands of houses burnt down and tens of thousands rendered homeless. The violence is fierce and widespread but the Government of India has not yet bothered to make any meaningful intervention. As some scholars pointed out the present crisis is an outcome of deception orchestrated by the Kuki-Chin militants that goes back in time.  Meitei’s ST demand was used as a camouflage to conceal the real agenda of the infamous May 3, 2023 rally, which is creation of a separate and exclusive political unit for the Kuki-Zo people out of the pluralistic and inclusive Manipur. However, several national media houses fell trap to this false narrative that the Meitei’s demand for ST tag triggered the violence. This illogical blame does not carry an iota of truth given that the demand is absolutely within the constitutional framework of India. Moreover, as indicated above, the issue has been pending with Manipur government for the last ten years. Add to it, every community has a legitimate political right to demand something constitutional.The Meitei’s demand for ST status has very little to do with the widespread violence. It is for the dream of exclusive Kuki-Zo homeland that guns have been booming across the state for the last nine months and hundreds of people killed. No doubt, the sounds of guns and bombs are loud and persistent but New Delhi has been maintaining a deafening silence till date. To many, the complete silence of the Prime Minister has turned out to be a complex political riddle. At the same time, it sends out a very clear message of both apathy and sheer indifference to the suffering of lakhs of people. People are dying every day and anarchy has become the order of the day. A situation of complete lawlessness has engulfed the society since the past nine months. With the combatants showing no sign of ceasing their offensive, Manipur has been pushed into a state of war. Although there is an elected government, complete lawlessness has become the order of the day. In some districts like Churachandpur and Kangpokpi, the writs of Kuki militant groups have become the ultimate authority whereas the state’s authority is openly defied and trampled upon. As pointed out repeatedly, the state has failed miserably to protect the lives and properties of citizens. If the inconsistence, if not contradiction, seen in the statements of the Chief Minister and the Security Advisor are any indication, the state has become a confused lot. The Chief Minister has asserted not once but several times that the ongoing violence is a war between the state and anti-state forces but the state has not yet initiated any decisive action. Whatever the state (New Delhi and Imphal) has done so far to address the violent crisis besieging the State are too little and too ineffective to make any change. The state needs to take up some decisive actions urgently to stop the violence and neutralise all the threats to the integrity of Manipur otherwise it will lose all its legitimacy sooner than later."

The false and shallow allegations necessitate a clarifi- cation with correct facts.The deployment strategy of Assam Rifles has been planned according to the threat perception. The battalions manning the border are specifically known as Border Guarding Battalions and are deployed tactically along the border to prevent any illegal movement of persons, war like stores or contraband. Their role as Border Guarding Battalions enables them for effective coverage along the border with adequate response capabilities. The Force dominates the border by aggressive area domination patrolling, laying of ambushes, aerial surveillance and has an increased presence along the border. With the expertise and decades of experience, Assam Rifles is trained and capable of addressing various security challenges including border defence and their presence along the border.The statement made against Assam Rifles appears to be based on unsubstantiated claims and lacks concrete evidence. It is appealed that media must refrain from putting unverified, factually incorrect articles which have the potential to sabotage the image, credibility and contribution of any Government Security Force.Yours faithfully,Lieutenant Colonel, Staff Officerm IGAR (S) (Public Relations & Media)"

Tel-Aviv-Nov-11Who-will-govern-Gaza-when-Israel-s-military-offensive-against-Hamas-ends-After-five-weeks-o,"Tel Aviv, Nov 11Who will govern Gaza when Israel's military offensive against Hamas ends? After five weeks of fighting, the answer remains shrouded in confusion.Hamas, a Palestinian group with an armed wing, has governed the coastal territory of about 2.4 million people since 2007 after which Israel placed Gaza under a strict blockade governing the movement of people and goods in and out.Hamas had seized power that year following street battles with the Palestinian Authority (PA).US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said late last month that the PA should retake control of the Gaza Strip from Hamas, with international players potentially filling a role in the interim.The Palestinian Authority currently has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.But in a meeting with Blinken earlier this month, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the PA could only assume power in Gaza if a ""comprehensive political solution"" is found for the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict encompassing the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.Last Wednesday Blinken again spoke of ""Palestinian-led governance"", and a Gaza ""unified with the West Bank"" under the Palestinian Authority.Abbas, 88, who has led the PA for 18 years, is widely unpopular and has been powerless against the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements and military control in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem.'Little hope'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long sought to sideline the PA, on Wednesday, told Fox News his country does not plan to reoccupy Gaza.Israel had occupied Gaza in 1967 and remained there until completing a withdrawal in 2005, leaving local authority with the PA.""We don't seek to govern Gaza. We don't seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future,"" Netanyahu said.Pushed on his plan for Gaza's future, Netanyahu said the impoverished and blockaded territory must be ""demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt.""""We'll have to find a government, a civilian government that will be there,"" he added, without detailing who might form it.Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters poured across the heavily militarised border on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages.Vowing to destroy the group, Israel retaliated with bombardment and a ground campaign that the Hamas health ministry in Gaza says has killed more than 11,000 people, mostly civilians including thousands of children.""I do not believe that any actor will agree to govern Gaza in these circumstances,"" said Hasan Khreisheh, deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, which has not met since 2007.""No Palestinian, no sane person will agree to return to Gaza on an American or Israeli tank.""In a note, the International Crisis Group (ICG) of analysts said there was ""little hope"" that the already deeply unpopular Palestinian Authority could return to Gaza on the back of an Israeli invasion and not be ""treated as an enemy"".'No one knows'Earlier this week, Lebanon-based senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the group will not accept a puppet government in the Gaza Strip and will remain in the territory.""Our people will not allow the United States to impose its plans to create an administration that suits it and that suits the occupation (Israel),"" he said.The US, Britain, Israel and others have designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation.Saleh al-Aruri, the group's exiled deputy chief of political affairs, has suggested that the future of Hamas cannot be divorced from that of the Palestinian people as a whole. To ""talk about post-Hamas is to talk about post-Palestine"", he said.On Friday, the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, which is fighting alongside Hamas, vowed to reject any imposed power on the territory.""If an international force were to be deployed to govern Gaza... the Palestinian people would consider it an occupying force and oppose it,"" said Mohammad al-Hindi, the group's deputy secretary-general.Jamal al-Fadi, a political and international relations professor in the Gaza Strip, believes that even if the PA agreed to regain control of Gaza, it would not do so without a potential agreement with Hamas.Without this, he told AFP, the Palestinian Authority would ""run the risk of a new civil war"".Majed al-Aruri, a human rights advocate based in Ramallah, in the Israel-occupied West Bank, said everyone knows how the latest war started, ""but no one knows how or on which terms it will end.""Agence France-Presse"
Emigration-and-immigration-have-always-been-associated-with-the-evolvement-of-human-societies-Emigration-and,"Emigration and immigration have always been associated with the evolvement of human societies. Emigration and immigration take place at different points of time in history at several places across the planet. The dual process of emigration and immigration is associated with the human history since the dawn of civilization and even before but it came under stringent regulations with the advent of the concept of Nation States. Now there is not a single place in any part of the world where emigration and immigration are allowed unhindered or unchecked. This does not mean the phenomena of emigration and immigration have been stopped totally. Even today, emigration and immigration take place at different places but all under established laws and norms. Migration of small groups of people from one country to another is generally accepted if the migration adheres to established rules and laws. The moment migration or more precisely immigration takes the form of exodus and is driven by an intention to settle permanently in the host country or state, it breeds serious socio-economic and political problems. Mass immigration is often not welcomed nor sanctioned by the laws of the host country/state, hence the term Illegal Immigration. There are very few places where mass and permanent illegal immigration is allowed unchecked and Manipur is one of them. For decades, Manipur has been a popular destination for mass and permanent illegal immigration from Myanmar. For any process of emigration and immigration, there are varied push and pull factors. One prominent push factor in the case of Myanmar and Manipur is the political persecution in Myanmar and one major pull factor is the economic opportunities available in Manipur. But the illegal immigrants from Myanmar are not satisfied with economic security, they want more which are political in nature. Taking undue advantage of their shared lineage with some communities of Manipur whose indigeneity is also under question, the illegal immigrants and their kindred tribes are now demanding a separate and exclusive political domain out of Manipur.Emboldened by the patronage received from some quarters, the illegal immigrants and their militant groups are now waging a war against the state of Manipur. This is the devastating effect of illegal immigration which went on unchecked for decades, and the challenge posed by mass illegal immigration is not restricted to a single community, it is, in fact, a grave threat to all the indigenous communities regardless of whether they are involved in the current conflict or not. The problem with illegal immigrants starts when they have little respect for the laws of the land. Perhaps, the Government of India has acknowledged the threats posed by illegal immigrants if Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s announcement to fence Indo-Myanmar border and end free movement regime between the two countries is any indication. No doubt, free movement regime has its own merits.  It facilitates people-to-people contact living in the border areas of the two countries in addition to boosting local trade and commerce. Given the fact that certain tribes living in the border areas share same ethnicity with those living across the international border, the objection raised by some quarters against ending free movement regime is understandable. At the same time, it is also a fact that the free movement regime is being exploited by illegal immigrants to make their way to Manipur and settle here permanently.  One needs to weigh the merits and demerits of the free movement regime carefully. Anything that facilitates permanent exodus from across the border is detrimental to the collective interest of Manipur and her indigenous people.  Another major factor which facilitates mass exodus or illegal immigration from Myanmar is the 400 Kms long open border Manipur shares with its eastern neighbour. If only the Government of India and Government of Manipur had checked illegal immigration from across the border in time, Manipur would not have been witnessing the current bloody turmoil."

He also raised the issue of unemployment, commercialisation of education through the entry of foreign universities in India, among other issues.Dhananjay pledged to tackle water, health, and infrastructure related issues on campus and demanded the release of student leaders detained under sedition charges.RSS-affiliated ABVP's presidential candidate, Umesh Chandra Ajmira, expressed confidence of a victory in the polls and highlighted the developments under the student outfit's governance and its efforts in advocating for student rights.NSUI's candidate Junaid Raza and BAPSA's Biswajit Minji also delivered impassioned speeches, criticising both the Left and right-wing groups and appealed to the students community to vote for them.Several leaders' speeches were marred by disruptions by some students during the debate. The university's Election Committee later confiscated the drums and other instruments used to create disruption.The JNUSU polls will be held on March 22 and results will be declared on March 24.PTI"

Hon-ble-Sir-The-people-of-Manipur-expected-high-hopes-from-your-speech-on-the-19th-July-2023-The-mass-beli,"Hon’ble Sir,The people of Manipur expected high hopes from your speech on the 19th July, 2023. The mass believed that your words will be a shower to the peoples & extinguish the flame of hatred among the Kukis and Meiteis. On the contrary, we are disillusioned on hearing your one sided speech. It seems that you are wrongly informed or briefed by the inteligence. In this connection, I would like enlighten you a few points:-1. The video parading two women in naked is a great crime against humanity. It is condemned by all concerned when it surfaced 78 days after the incident.Who hid the video for so many days and for what ?2. What you will do if your house and your father/brothers’ houses numbering about 1000 (one thousand) were burnt on the evening of 3rd May, 2023 by the armed Kuki Militants at Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Moreh etc simuntaneously under the ethnic cleaning programme for Kukiland. Is not this a cruel crime against humanity ? The poor armless Meitei villagers have lost everything except their life. What was their fault ? Have you fixed responsibility for these catastrope? What penalty you have given to the Kuki Terrorists Who are using Sniper/Telescopic Rifles.3. On 28th May, 2023 Smt. Sorokhaibam Ibetombi Devi an old woman of 80 (eighty) years was burnt alive in her own house at Serou village, Kakching District, Manipur. She was wife of an Indian freedom fighter (TAMAPATRA AWARDEE) Late Sri. Sorokhaibam Churachand Singh. Have you condemned the incident ? What action has been taken against the security personnel ? Who permitted to burn more than 500 houses at Serou & Sugnu village of Kakching District, on 28th May, 2023 under the very nose of Central Security Forces. Who ordered them to remain silent spectators ?CAUSES OF KUKI NARCO TERRORISTS ATTACK IN MANIPURThe root causes of this ethnic clash or narco-terrorism are (i) The present State Govt. started identification of illegal immigrants from Myanmar (Pre-NRC exercise). (ii) Strong drive against the encroachers in the Reserved and Protected Forest area of Manipur. (iii) War on Drugs (Destroying of lakhs of popy plants etc.) in Kuki dominated hill districts of Manipur.DEMANDS OF KUKIS1. The Kukis want a “Separate Administration “ or “Kuki land” a land where they can grow popy plants and conduct business on drugs with impunity by bifrucating from Manipur.2. Some Kukis of Manipur specially politicians & druglords encourage illegal immigration of Chin-Kuki Peoples from Myanmar. They arrange their Aadhaar & Voter cards and assist in establishing new Kuki villages. They get cheap labours as well as strong support in election.3. The Kuki Militants wanted to expand their proposed Kuki land or (Zalengam/Zo Country). They are burning the houses of the Meiteis in the adjoining areas of Churachandpur, Chandel, Tengnoupal and Kangpokpi Districts. Till today, they are firing even to the armless cultivators/villagers. They are killing cows also. It is shamefull !DEMANDS OF THE MEITEIS1. Demand of the Meiteis are : “No Separate Administration or Kuki Union Territory” in Manipur.2. The Suspension of Operation (SoO) with Kuki Militants should be abrogated or their arms should be controlled by the Indian Army/Security Forces.3. The NRC should be implemented strictly in Manipur as per law. The illegal Kuki -Chin immigrants from Myanmar should be deported to their country as per International Law/Convention. They should be treated as refugees.4. The Meitei/Meetei should be included in the Scheduled Tribe list of India.5. The National Highways should be free from looting by the terrorists.HOW TO BRING PEACE IN MANIPUR1. The Govt. of India should appoint a small committee of neutral persons (2/3 members) as Facilatators/Negotiators among the Govt. of India/Manipur Meitei and Kuki leaders.2. The peace committee should consists of reputed politicians, CSOs & Religious Leaders of Naga, Meitei & Kuki etc. The members should be around 15 only.3. The Peace Committee should visit Churachandpur, Moreh and Kangpokpi etc. Discuss with the leading leaders of the agitators. They should act as messengers of Peace between the Govt. of Manipur, Kuki and Meitei leaders and people to people. The committee should be funded by the Govt. of Manipur.ConclusionThe purpose Kukiland will bring more headache to the Govt. of India. The reasons are (i) Demand for more than 100 New States will come up, in India. (ii) Manipur is ancient Kingdom and recognised by the International Treaty of Yandaboo (Myanmar) in 1826 AD. (iii) Manipur was merged with India on 15th October, 1949. (iv) Many Kukis are refugees. A refugee can’t claim homeland in a foreign country ie Manipur/India. The Meiteis will go to International Court of Justice, (v) The Govt. of Manipur/India should be resettled rehabitated at the IDPS at an early date.Lastly, I appeal to your wisdom and take decisions to bring peace and harmony for a united Manipur. Long Live Manipur & India.Yours sincerely,( Sapam Bheigya )Ex-President,Manipur Historical Society, Imphal."
Guwahati-Feb-4With-Lok-Sabha-elections-months-away-Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-Sunday-told-a-large-gather,"Guwahati, Feb 4With Lok Sabha elections months away, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday told a large gathering in Guwahati that his “guarantee waali gaadi” (guarantee wagon) would bring economic development in Assam and the North East, strengthen connectivity in the region as well as with neighbouring South Asian countries.“I want to tell every youth in Assam and North East, your dreams are my vision. To fulfill your dreams, Modi will not spare any effort…This is Modi’s guarantee,” said the Prime Minister at the Khanapara field in Guwahati.However, in his nearly 32 minutes-long speech, there was no mention of the turmoil and bloodshed in conflict-ridden Manipur — an important inland gateway to Southeast Asia that is crucial to India’s ‘Act East Policy’ which aims to enhance trans regional, cross-border connectivity and trade with Myanmar and neighbouring countries.Since 3 May, Manipur has been embroiled in deadly clashes between the Kuki community and the Meiteis. At least 200 people have died, and tens of thousands displaced. Many fear they will never be able to return home.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government at the Centre has been stressing on economic reforms as it woos voters across the country, a glimpse of what was witnessed in Assam Sunday as the PM announced development projects worth Rs 11,600 crore.Reacting to Modi’s speech, former Manipur Minister and veteran CPI leader Dr M Nara said, “This is beyond our belief that a PM didn’t say anything on the Manipur issue. His attitude is not a transparent one, he and his Government are now busy campaigning for the upcoming Lok Sabha election.“We never came across such a Prime Minister. He thinks that Manipur is not one of India’s States. We are feeling very sad about his attitude towards Manipur,” he added.Another former Manipur Minister, Okram Joy Singh, termed it “a sad moment” for the State. “A Prime Minister of this country reaching Assam is just like reaching Manipur. Even though his visit and his speech might be related with the Lok Sabha election campaign, mentioning nothing on the Manipur issue while being the PM is a very sad moment for the State.”Veewon Thokchom, research scholar from Manipur, told ThePrint: “As the PM of this country, it hurts us that he has not addressed the pain and suffering we have been going through for more than 9 months now. To many, the silence only solidifies the belief that the Central Government is deliberately prolonging this violence for reasons it knows best. The historical fact of the alienation of our land and people from National politics and psyche has reached a new height today.”‘Earlier govts made a trend of being ashamed of their own culture’Modi arrived in Guwahati Saturday evening, and stayed the night at Koinadhara, the state guest house.Greeting the crowd Sunday, the PM identified himself as “aapka saathi” (your friend), and said that the “Northeast believes in Modi’s guarantee” (of development). Chants of “Modi, Modi” and “Jai Sri Ram” could be heard as the Prime Minister continued his speech, emphasising the tourism potential that religious sites like Kamakhya Temple hold.“Today, connectivity to Southeast Asia is enhanced through the Northeast, under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) programme, many road upgradation projects have started. When these connectivity projects are completed, the region would be part of the bigger economic growth,” said Modi.Taking a dig at the Congress, Modi said that previous governments failed to understand the significance of places associated with faith which “symbolise an indelible mark of our civilization over thousands of years”.“Unfortunately, even those who ran governments in the country for a long time after independence could not understand the importance of these holy places of faith. They had made a trend of being ashamed of their own culture, their own past for political gains. No country can ever develop by erasing its past, forgetting it like this, cutting its roots. In 10 years, India’s situation has changed,” said the prime minister.Speaking about the BJP’s policy of “Vikaas and Virasat” (progress and heritage), the PM spoke about the BJP government’s contribution in Assam and the Northeast in the past 10 years — in the fields of connectivity, healthcare, tourism and sports.Modi said that he had been a party worker in Assam for many years. “I have travelled to every area of the state. And I remember the obstacles along the way around that time — roadblocks, protests…I even witnessed bomb blasts in Guwahati. Today, all of it is in the past. People are living in peace.”“The Northeast believes in Modi’s guarantee. Look at Assam, places that were once disturbed areas are now peaceful. Border disputes between northeastern states are getting resolved. After the BJP government was formed, more than 10 big peace agreements (with insurgent outfits) have been signed. In the past few years, thousands of youth in the Northeast gave up arms and chose the road to progress,” said the prime minister.He further said that more than 7,000 youth from Assam have surrendered weapons and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been removed from several districts.  The  Print"

What-is-there-to-show-that-there-is-a-Government-in-place-at-Imphal-The-answer-is-best-left-to-the-people-wh,"What is there to show that there is a Government in place at Imphal ? The answer is best left to the people who matter, but even as 37715 students are set to appear for one of the most important stages in their academic pursuit, the Class X exams conducted by the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur comes the news of a 48 hour bandh which is set to come into force from midnight of March 14. Just 24 hours before the bandh was announced for everyone to hear and digest, came the news of a pharmacy fired at in the high security zone Thangal Keithel and a little earlier a JCB operator or driver and a helper were brutally assaulted by four armed persons on the road leading to Toubul from Mayang Imphal. This is apart from the on and off gun attacks launched on the Meitei villages at the foothills and Manipur is clearly living up to the image of the Wild West. A term synonymous with Hollywood but while this is about the celluloid world, Manipur seems to be living up to the understanding of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The only hitch is there nothing to suggest that the Good is anywhere on the horizon and that he would come riding on his horse, set things right and ride into the sunset. This is about the romance of the Westerns, but the reality in Manipur today is something far removed from the celluloid world and there is nothing romantic about the presence of gun wielders who do not hesitate to throw their weight around and in the process make victims out of the civilians, people who may be out on the road to make a living. Any Government worth its salt would have woken up to the grim reality and instilled confidence in the common people that their rights would be protected and no one is above the law. But when more and more start to ‘rise above the law,’ flex their muscles, impose diktats expecting everyone to fall in line then surely the path to anarchy is paved. This is what is extremely worrying and situation has come to such a pass that to many, the golden line is ‘silence is the better part of valour.’ Confronting the foe is something far removed from flexing one’s muscle and this dividing line should be clear to all, especially those who have the ‘power and the influence’ to thrash anyone who they think have crossed their path, impose their diktats but in the process gain a certain degree of legitimacy amongst some sections of the public. The last point should underline the ‘absence’ of the Government and in such a reality, it is the rule of law which is the first casualty. How long will Manipur be made to pay the price ? Not something which has been vocalised, but at times the unsaid but intensely felt reality will only peg Manipur down on the index of everything that humanity stands for.It is amidst this grim reality that over 37 thousand young students are set to appear for their Class X examinations from March 15. The exact figure is not with The Sangai Express but of the over 37 thousand candidates there must be some, if not many, staying at any of the relief centres set up across the length and breadth of the State.    This is where it becomes important to give some thoughts to the plight of the young students holed up in one of the relief centres and a bandh on day 1 of their first public examinations will not help them at all. Perhaps some thoughts on this may be given by the bandh sponsors for the sake of the young students. Manipur is passing through a very critical phase and this is where the Government should demonstrate that it is aware of the situation and the best way to show that it emphatises with the people is to ensure the rule of law. The ethnic violence has taken a stranglehold on the lives of the people for over 10 months now and one primary reason why numerous power centres have emerged all over the place is the failure of the Government to dispense with its duties effectively. What steps has the Government taken up to fill up the vacuum created since the evening of May 3 ? Questions which only the Government can answer, but let it also be very clear that this is not the time for grand announcement but to ensure the rule of law. And the first step towards this is to ensure that Manipur starts taking her step towards normalcy. That a talk has been initiated with the Kuki leaders with the HAC Chairman leading the way is welcome, and one hopes some concrete, positive results come out from the initiative."
May-3-2023-to-March-10-2024-and-what-are-the-lessons-that-Manipur-has-learnt-from-these-days-of-turmoil-Ov,"May 3, 2023 to March 10, 2024 and what are the lessons that Manipur has learnt from these days of turmoil ? Over 200 killed, that is officially, 28 still missing, with the Government still unable to officially confirm their status and if dead, recover their bodies, numerous houses torched and levelled to the ground, over 60,000 people surviving in different relief centres spread across the nook and corner of the State, business down and crippled and apart from the question of when Manipur will truly start taking the first few steps towards normalcy, the other equally important question would be ‘what lessons has Manipur learnt’ from the days of turmoil ?’ It may not be possible to put the lessons learnt or ought to have been learnt in black and white, but the first test on whether any lessons have been learnt will obviously be the coming Lok Sabha elections. How will Manipur vote is the question, but here again there will be no answer in black and white but this is perhaps the finest opportunity for the people to demonstrate that they have learnt a lesson from the turmoil. Already names are doing the round on who will be nominated by the big two, especially in the Inner Parliamentary seat, but remember these are all speculations, worked out after learning who have stood up to be counted as potential candidates. As in the past, the final word may lie with the high command or whatever term one may like to give, but the inputs from the State unit will be very, very important. So who is best placed to present the case of the people and Manipur on the floor of Parliament and before the Nation as a whole ? The importance of this poser should not blow over the head of the voters, for ultimately the man representing Manipur on the floor of Lok Sabha will reflect the mentality of the voters, the people who voted for him or her. It is also equally important for everyone to acknowledge that in as much as it is the candidates who have to slug it out in the election ring, it is also a test of the character of the people and how they are able to choose from amongst the people who have come forward. As a young man shared in his social media post the other day, election is not about choosing a King, but is about electing someone to represent the interests of the people and the place. The elected should do the bidding of the people and not the people toeing the line of the elected. This is the bottomline and the coming Lok Sabha election is the best time to demonstrate that the people have matured enough not to be swayed by lies, money and muscle power.Now is the time for the people to start preparing questions, jotting down the points that ought to be raised and start studying the antecedents of each and every candidate or at this stage the intending candidates. It will also help to study which of the political parties have the best interests of Manipur in their scheme of things. Situation should have warranted that the people are now able to distinguish between  what are populist measures and steps announced or promised with a long term vision, keeping Manipur at the centre of everything. Early days yet but it is important for everyone to remember that the person they elect will represent them in Parliament for the next five years and this is not something to be taken lightly. Manipur, more particularly the Meiteis, should also come to the point that their focus need not only be on the Inner Parliamentary seat, for even though people in the eight Assembly seats, do not have the right to contest, they can be the key in deciding which candidate gets elected. Afterall the MP from the Outer Parliamentary Constituency will also be representing them in the Lok Sabha. In a way the opportunity to have a say in the politics of the hills should be capitalised upon and this is what the voters in the 8 Assembly Constituencies should demonstrate. Much will depend on how the different political parties, which have a presence in the hills of Manipur, are able to reach out to the Meiteis in the said Assembly Constituencies. Time to show the mettle and character of Manipur."

We intend on dealing with Hamas who have turned hospitals into fortified positions,"" it said in response to the question of whether it planned to enter Gaza hospitals at some point.Hamas has denied using civilians as human shields and health officials say growing numbers of Israeli strikes on or near hospitals put at risk patients, medical staff and thousands of evacuees who have taken shelter in and near their buildings.Qidra said Israeli army snipers commandeering rooftops of buildings near the hospital fired into the medical complex from time to time, limiting the ability of medics and people to move.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The hospital suspended operations after fuel ran out, Qidra said, adding: ""As a result, one newborn baby died inside the incubator, where there are 45 babies.""Hamas denies using the hospital for its military purposes and has asked the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to send missions to Shifa to investigate the Israeli allegations.The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - separated from Gaza by Israel and run by a rival administration to Hamas - said separately that 39 babies were at risk at the hospital.Minister Mai Alkaila had initially said they had died because they could not get oxygen or medicine to them and electricity was cut off, but the ministry later corrected the information to say that one had died and 39 were at risk.""39 premature babies in Al-Shifa Medical Complex are threatened with death at any moment, and one of them died this morning. Failure to bring fuel into the hospitals will be a death sentence for the rest. The incubators will only be able to work until this evening, after which the fuel will run out.""Contacted again about the ministry's statement, Qidra reiterated that there was no electricity at the hospital and no internet.""We are working hard to keep them alive, but we are afraid we may lose them in the coming hours,"" he said. ""There is no electricity in the hospital completely.""On Friday, Gaza officials had said missiles landed in a courtyard of Al Shifa, killing one person and wounding others. Israel's military said later that a misfired projectile launched by Palestinian militants in Gaza had hit Shifa.World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said health workers the group was in contact with at Shifa had been forced to leave the hospital in search of safety.""Many of the thousands sheltering at the hospital are forced to evacuate due to security risks, while many still remain there,"" Tedros wrote on social media on Friday.                Reuters"

This kind of role-play simulations helps students understand the nitty-gritty of working on projects in a real world scenario and encourages them to think, be creative and use communication skills to collaborate, she further said.Young students need to inculcate the philosophy of tolerance from an early age to contribute in Nation building as well as the State.

Islamabad-Jan-30Former-Pakistan-prime-minister-Imran-Khan-was-sentenced-Tuesday-to-10-years-in-prison-less,"Islamabad, Jan 30Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in prison, less than two weeks before the country votes in an election his party has been hamstrung from contesting.Khan's sentence was handed down inside Adiala jail, where he has been confined for much of the time since his August arrest and buried under an avalanche of court cases he says have been orchestrated to prevent his return to office.The same sentence was handed down on Shah Mehmood Qureshi, vice-president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party who served as foreign minister under Khan.""Former prime minister Imran Khan and PTI vice-president Qureshi have been sentenced to 10 years each,"" a spokesman for the party told AFP.State media also reported the convictions and sentences.The case against both men related to allegations they leaked classified state documents.Khan was prime minister from 2018 to 2022 -- when he was ousted in a no confidence vote after losing the backing of the nation's military kingmakers.As opposition leader he waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the top brass, accusing them of ousting him in a US-backed conspiracy and of plotting an assassination attempt which wounded him.Khan was briefly arrested last May, and Islamabad used the resulting unrest to justify a sweeping crackdown on PTI which has seen many senior leaders defect or go underground.""This is murder of justice,"" said Tauseef Ahmed Khan, a human right activist and political analyst.""But his popularity among the people will grow in leaps and bounds as his sympathisers will increase because of this gross injustice.""PTI has been largely absent from the public sphere in the runup to elections.The party has been stripped of its election symbol, and candidates forced to run as individuals.At the same time Nawaz Sharif -- head of one of the dynastic parties which have historically helmed Pakistan -- has returned from self-imposed exile and seen his myriad convictions dissolve in the courts.Analysts say it's a sign the three-time former prime minister is the favoured candidate of the top brass, who have directly ruled Pakistan for much of its history.According to Pakistan's constitution, elections must be held within 90 days of parliament being dissolved -- which happened five months ago in August.The election commission blamed the delay on the need to redraw constituency boundaries following a new census in 2023.In the interim Pakistan has been ruled by a caretaker govt regarded as pliable by the military establishment.

Kromah’s strike also helped NEROCA return to winning ways. The last time NEROCA had won a match was back in November last year, when they edged past Delhi FC 4-3.The win helped NEROCA leapfrog TRAU to 12th in the league. While both teams are on 10 points from 19 matches, the former are ahead on the head-to-head record.Understanding the significance of the match, both for morale and positioning in the league, NEROCA approached the game with a clear intent to seize control and capitalise on their chances.NEROCA goalkeeper Soram Poirei was alert to the dangers in the early exchanges and pulled off a good save to keep Danish Aribam out in the 24th minute.The very next minute, NEROCA’s Darius Snorton Perwood found himself in a similar position, and took a shot at the TRAU goal that Aaryan Anjaneya saved.The first half’s best chance went to TRAU when Deepak Singh floated a cross from the left flank. An unmarked Issahak Nuhu Seidu connected with the ball sweetly but his shot hit the woodwork.The second half panned out similarly before NEROCA’s David Simbo hit the crosspiece with a powerful long-distance strike in the 70th minute.NEROCA’s persistence finally paid off when Ansumana Kromah scored in the 79th minute. Adama Coulibaly exchanged passes with Kromah before setting up the Liberian forward with a cross from the right. Kromah didn’t make any mistake as he volleyed home a crucial goal that fetched the points for his side. AIFF Media Team"

IMPHAL-Oct-9-Urging-all-to-understand-the-threat-posed-by-the-rapidly-increasing-population-of-non-indigenous-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 9: Urging all to understand the threat posed by the rapidly increasing population of non-indigenous people in the State, Thangmeiband AC MLA Kh Joykisan has demanded the State Government to hand over the task of identifying non-indigenous people to the Constituency itself.Speaking to media persons at his residence at Khoyathong today, Joykisan said that the people of Manipur are rooting against CAB and the Chief Minister himself even claimed that a clause for the protection of the indigenous people will be inserted.However, how much protection will this specific clause be able to provide for the people, he asked explaining that when there is a Government which can scrap Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir without flinching, how much faith should the people of Manipur and the North East have in the assurance that a protective clause will even be included.If such a clause can indeed be included, then it can also be taken out at another point of time in the future which raises questions about the future of the indigenous people, Joykisan claimed.Appealing all to settle any difference amicably, the MLA stressed on the importance of coming together and uniting to face the threat posed by CAB.He urged the people to start identifying the non-indigenous people within their own locality and also demanded the Chief Minister to direct all the 60 MLAs to identify and calculate how many non-locals are living in their respective Constituencies.Asking who will bear the responsibilities if any non-locals  are found in the voter list of Thangmeiband, Joykisan announced that if anyone can provide proof that any non locals were enlisted in the voter list for the Constituency as vote bank, he himself will retire from politics and he would also welcome social boycott from the people.Stating that he has heard of rumours that more than a thousand non-locals have been enlisted in the voter list of his Constituency, the MLA appealed to all to work together and find out who did the act of enlisting the non-indigenous people and to punish the officials or politicians who are involved in the act.He continued that just bidding time, waiting for assent from the President of the country to the Manipur People Bill, will not bring any positive change in the State and no one till date, has been able to provide any assurance that the Bill will even be approved. The MLA further demanded immediate termination of the officials responsible for enlisting the non-locals in the voter list and added that nowadays, there seems to be many CSOs or social activists, who appear to be working for the welfare of the people but in reality are tainted with political preference."

Sir-Apropos-the-news-item-Dialogue-is-the-way-forward-TSE-25-12-23-the-people-of-Manipur-sans-some-h,"Sir,Apropos the news item ‘Dialogue is the way forward…..’ (TSE 25.12.23.) the people of Manipur sans some hot headed Kuki Mizo Leaders are deeply disappointed at the failure of Central and local Governments to take any concrete step to bring to an end the Kuki onslaught on the Meiteis even after 8 months. It seems the Governments are hoping for a natural death of the unprovoked and unwarranted violence.It was hoped that the 40,000 army and paramilitary forces would be enough to frighten the Kuki militants and subdue the violence. But it only encouraged them.Government authorities say efforts to resolve are underway, but no visible actions can be seen. The Kuki militants are firing at will almost in a sadistic manner at the innocent valley people.The unilateral violence is unfortunately being referred to as Meitei- Kuki fight. It is not quite so. The Meiteis never invade or cause violence on the Kuki villages, except in the few weeks at the beginning which was a panic reaction to the onslaught on them.People are tempted to believe that the Central leaders are not very concerned and are disinterested in solving the problem.Thankfully, Sri Himalay, Lt Gen (Retd) who has a vast knowledge of conflict resolution has put forward a pragmatic approach to make a beginning to solve the problem (TSE dt 25.12.23).. He has called for “a collective effort of administrative mechanism, security forces, civil organisations (CSO) and media…..”Hope the political leaders will now take the lead and sincerely work to end the conflict.Personally speaking I am at a loss to this day why the violence is being referred to as a communal clash between Meitei and Kuki. In the first place the demand of the Kuki is something which the former can’t decide and grant nor there had been any tension earlier between the two communities.Yours  faithfully,AD Singh,Keishamthong,Imphal"
CAIRO-GAZA-Dec-19Israel-kept-pounding-the-shattered-Gaza-Strip-on-Tuesday-while-Yemen-s-pro-Palestinian-Hou,"CAIRO/GAZA, Dec 19Israel kept pounding the shattered Gaza Strip on Tuesday while Yemen’s pro-Palestinian Houthi movement vowed to defy a U.S.-led naval mission and keep hitting Israeli targets in the Red Sea.Israel’s campaign to eradicate Hamas militants behind an Oct. 7 massacre has left the coastal enclave in ruins, brought widespread hunger and homelessness, and killed nearly 20,000 Gazans, according to the Palestinian enclave’s health ministry.Under foreign pressure to avoid killing innocents, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will not stop until a remaining 129 hostages are freed and Hamas is obliterated after its fighters’ slaying of 1,200 Israelis.The conflict has spread beyond Hamas-ruled Gaza, including into the Red Sea where Iran-aligned Houthi forces have been attacking vessels with missiles and drones. That has prompted the creation of a multinational naval operation to protect commerce in the area, but the Houthis said they would carry on anyway, possibly with a sea operation every 12 hours.“Our position will not change in the direction of the Palestinian issue, whether a naval alliance is established or not,” Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters, saying only Israeli ships or those going to Israel would be targeted.“Our position in support of Palestine and the Gaza Strip will remain until the end of the siege, the entry of food and medicine, and our support for the oppressed Palestinian people will remain continuous.”Announcing the naval operation, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Bahrain that joint patrols would be held in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which encompass a major East-West global shipping route. “This is an international challenge that demands collective action,” he said.British maritime security firm Ambrey said on Tuesday it received information of a potential boarding attempt west of Yemen’s Aden port city, adding that the attack was unsuccessful and all crew were safe.Some shippers are re-routing around Africa.Deaths mountIn Gaza, Israel’s latest missiles hit the southern Rafah area, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees have amassed in recent weeks, killing at least 20 people and wounding dozens of others, according to local health officials.Residents said they had to dig in the rubble with bare hands. “This is a barbarian act,” said Mohammed Zurub.Among the dead was Palestinian journalist Adel Zurub and several members of his family, medics said. That raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed to 97, according to the Hamas-run government media office.In the north, another strike killed 13 people and wounded about 75 in the Jabalia refugee camp, the health ministry said.Israel says it warns of strikes in advance so civilians can escape, and it accuses Hamas of hiding in residential areas.The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA said more than 60% of Gaza’s infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, with more than 90% of the 2.3 million population uprooted. “This is a staggering and unprecedented level of destruction and forced displacement, taking place in front of our eyes,” it said.In the ground war, where Israel has lost 132 soldiers, tanks advanced further into the southern city of Khan Younis and shelled a market area but met heavy resistance, residents said.Thousands of Hamas fighters, based in tunnel networks, are waging guerrilla-style war against Israeli forces.“The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is continuing to operate against Hamas terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement.Child amputees killed in hospitals, UN saysThe Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday that 19,667 Palestinians had been killed and 52,586 wounded since Oct. 7.U.N. officials voiced disbelief about the situation in hospitals, which lack supplies and safety.“I’m furious that children who are recovering from amputations in hospitals are then killed in those hospitals,” said James Elder, spokesperson for the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, saying Nasser Hospital, the largest operational one left in the enclave, had been shelled twice in the past 48 hours.U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk reiterated an appeal for a ceasefire and work towards a two-state solution.Despite 11 weeks of attacks against it, Hamas said it had still been able on Tuesday to fire a salvo of rockets towards Israel’s commercial capital Tel Aviv, where sirens sounded.      Reuters"

GAZA-Dec-31The-border-zone-between-the-Gaza-Strip-and-Egypt-should-be-under-Israel-s-control-Israeli-Prime,"GAZA, Dec 31The border zone between the Gaza Strip and Egypt should be under Israel’s control, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, as he predicted the war in the Palestinian enclave and on other regional fronts would last many months.As Israel entered the 13th week of its war in Gaza on Saturday, Netanyahu held a news conference where he renewed his promise to eliminate Hamas and bring home all Israelis held captive in Gaza.“The Philadelphi Corridor – or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] – must be in our hands. It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,” he said.Israel has said it intends to destroy Hamas in Gaza and demilitarise the territory to prevent any repeat of the October 7 cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by the armed group.“The war is at its height. We are fighting on all of the fronts. Achieving victory will require time. As the [Israeli army] chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months,” Netanyahu said.He also added a rare threat to attack Iran directly over the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border.“If [the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group] Hezbollah expands the warfare, it will suffer blows that it has not dreamed of – and so too Iran,” Netanyahu said without elaborating.The war has triggered fears of a regional conflagration amid rising tensions with other Iranian-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.Israel’s relentless bombing and ground offensive on Gaza since October 7 has killed at least 21,672 people, most of them women and children, with thousands of others buried under the rubble. The military operation has also displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population of the besieged territory.About 1,140 people were killed by Hamas in Israel in the October 7 attacks.Al Jazeera, Reuters"

Guwahati-Feb-13-Nestled-in-the-majestic-foothills-of-the-Patkai-hill-range-of-Charaideo-the-Moidams-the-e,"Guwahati, Feb 13Nestled in the majestic foothills of the Patkai hill range of Charaideo, the Moidams, the earthen mound-burial of the Ahom kingdom shines as a testimony to its past glory and culture.Charaideo, a Tai Ahom word meaning “a prominent city on the hilltop” (Che=a city, Rai=prominent, Doi=hill), was the original capital of the Ahom Kings and was established by its first King, Chao Lung Sukafa in 1253.For many, either from the State itself or visitors from outside including the writer, the Moidams, at first glance, would look like another small mound along the foothills. But it is much more than that. Deep down inside the mound lies the chamber/s that exhibits the centuries-old culture practices and events of the Ahom Kingdom.Tai AhomSome say the history of Assam is never complete without Tai Ahom. The Ahom or Tai Ahom is one of the ethnic groups in the present State of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in the North Eastern part of India. According to historians, King Chao Lung Sukafa along with around 9,000 people including all his royal family members, officials, and soldiers came down from Mong Mao under Yunnan province of the People’s Republic of China.They crossed the Patkai range of Nagaland and finally reached Tipam in Namrup of Dibrugarh district of present-day Assam. Later, the King chose Charaideo as the first capital of his Kingdom in 1228. Though the capital was moved many times by the 39 Kings from one place to another during its nearly 600 years of rule over Assam, Charaideo remained the symbolic power of the Ahom Kingdom.Not only royal palaces and historical monuments built by those Kings over a while, one of the main tourist attraction centers of Charaideo is the sacred burial grounds of the Ahom Kings and Queens, which are commonly known as “Moidams” in the local language.The Tai Ahom Kingdom of Assam was one of the oldest three Independent Kingdoms in the  Southeast Asian countries. Others are the Manipur Kingdom and Tripura Kingdom. The 598-year-old dynasty of Ahom Kingdom lost its independence after the ‘Treaty of Yandaboo’ in 1825 with the Burmese King and slowly became a part of the British empire.MoidamsA Moidam is a tumulus or mound of the royalty and aristocracy of the medieval Ahom Kingdom, where the Kings, Queens, and nobles were buried after their death. Architecturally, it comprises a massive underground vault with one or more chambers having domical superstructure and covered by a heap of earthen mounds and externally it appears as a hemispherical mound. At the top of the mound, a small open pavilion chow-chali is provided. An octagonal dwarf wall encloses the whole Moidam.According to Mrindul Kanwar, a historian of Tai Ahom, all the kings, queens and other officials were laid to rest in these Moidams after their deaths. Interestingly, as a practice not just the dead bodies of Kings or Queens, some of the servants and officials were also buried alive, to serve their ‘heavenly God’ under this mound. The practices were stopped after the Kings adopted Hinduism as their main religion from Taoism in the middle of the 18th century, Kanwar told The North East Affairs.According to a report published by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), a typical Moidam had five parts and the excavations revealed that the Moidams were massive structures of burn-bricks plastered with lime-surkhi mortar. The height of the structure measures approximately 9 m externally and 5 m internally. The entrance to the Moidams was thought to be a semi-circular brick-built archway; the passage resembles a tunnel. The entrance to the tomb proper was sealed by a thick wall of brick and ashlar stone masonry joined together by iron clamps.Internally, the plan of the Moidam is rectangular, the brick-built walls rise from the floor level to a height of about 2 m and thereafter rise the domical roof.Under protectionCurrently, the Moidams in Chairaideo are divided into two – Core and Buffer zones. The Core zone has again split into two where the first one has 30 Moidams and the latter 60. The first 30 Moidams have been under the protection of ASI since 1970 and the remaining under the Assam Archaeological Department since 1985. The total area of Moidiams under the core zone is about 842 bighas (one bigha = 0.62 acres, one acre = 43560 sq. ft, or one Bigha = 26910.66 sq. ft).Under the buffer zone, there are around 150 Moidams with a total area of nearly 7000 bighas.  The Moidams in the Core zone are almost well protected by the concerned authorities, but the remaining Maidams in the Buffer zone are unprotected and are encroached on by many people.World Heritage siteIn March last year, the Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed that Charaideo Moidams had met all technical requirements of the UNESCO Secretariat. Moidams is India’s nomination for UNESCO’s World Heritage Site status in the culture category for 2023.In a tweet, Sarma said, “With great pride, happy to share a landmark achievement in our endeavour to get World Heritage Site status for Charaideo Moidams.”Soon after his announcement, a one-member team of UNESCO visited the site of Charaideo Moidams in October last year. During his visit, senior officials of the State Archaeology Department had submitted a dossier including ninety questions and answers that claimed to fulfil all technical requirements for a World Heritage Site Status. An official meeting of UNESCO will likely be held in July in Delhi this year and will decide whether the site deserves to be a Heritage Site or not.When this writer visited the site, many constructions or refabrication appeared to be going on, but at a slow pace. Domestic animals like cows and goats were seen grazing on the top of mounds. Local people, when asked, disclosed that many boundary walls are yet to be completed. Garbage and pieces of waste, plastic bottles scattered all over the street. Parking spaces are not properly maintained. Many vendors are seen parking in their way. Solar posts around the Moidams are not working at all.Another local man, when asked, confided that he would be so happy if his dream of Moidams becoming a world heritage site was fulfilled. But if the authorities want to make the area clean they should appoint more local people. Many of the tourists come either from Sivasagar town or far-flung districts. The Government should consider developing more hotels, guest houses, and wide roads in the nearby area so that more tourists would come and it can become a major tourist attraction centre.The North East Affairs"

Don-t-delay-MCSCC-Main-Exam-Group-of-Aspirants,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Dec 18: The Group of Aspirants has appealed Government not to delay the MCSCC (Main) Examination 2016.In a statement today, they reminded that a review petition filed by some of the then successful candidates, now terminated officers, had been dismissed by the High Court on December 17 last year.The review petition was filed after the High Court quashed the MCSCC (Main) Examination 2016 on October 18, 2019. The Supreme Court had also upheld the order of the HC quashing the examination on November 22, 2019 and ordered the MPSC (Manipur Public Service Commission) to conduct the MCSCC (Main) Exam 2016 afresh.The terminated officers and Government of Manipur had challenged the judgement on the ground that wards of members of the members of the inquiry committee, which probed the alleged irregularities in the examination, had appeared in the MCSCC Preliminary Examination  2016 and accordingly, the committee had submitted a “biased  report”, said the Group of Aspirants.While the inquiry was conducted on the Main examination only, the wards of the members of the inquiry member were not successful in the Preliminary Examination.In addition, the inquiry committee was formed by an order of the High Court on November 20, 2017 with the knowledge of Counsels of all the involved parties in the matter. No one had challenged the appointment of the members. The Supreme Court had also granted permission to the committee to inspect all the answer sheets including that of the successful candidates. Accordingly, the inquiry committee submitted its final report on July 9, 2018.The inquiry committee had reported gross illegalities and irregularities. As many as 5,764 answer scripts were found without the signature of Supervisor while 93 were found lacking signatures of the examiners.The MPSC was found violating rules in the conduct of the examination such as conducting the examination by Secretary MPSC by taking the charge of Controller of Examination, conducting the examination by the Additional Secretary MPSC again taking the charge of Controller for 10 days while Secretary was out of station, no Head Examiner in the said examination, no instruction or guidelines was provided to the officials involved including the examiner, no moderation and scaling  and providing extra answer sheets to some of the candidates violating instruction to the examinations, said the Group of Aspirants.Considering all these facts, the High Court had clearly mentioned in its October 18, 2019 order that the MCSCC (Main) Examination 2016 was “not an examination at all” and directed the MPSC to quash the said examination. The Court also directed the Department of Personnel, Government of Manipur to cancel the appointment of the successful candidates.Stating that the State Government had filed the review petition after Supreme Court upheld the High Court order of quashing the Main Examination, the Group of Aspirants asked if the Government would further go to the Supreme Court to defend the matter by “wasting maximum resources” of the State and precious time of the candidates.The Group of Aspirants has been pursuing to make the MPSC clean and transparent and ensure corruption free recruitment with the help of the public, it said, appealing for public support.The group urged the Government and MPSC to conduct the MCSCC (Main) Examination 2016 without further delay."
New-Delhi-Mar-17-As-the-country-gears-up-for-the-world-s-biggest-electoral-exercise-messaging-platforms-li,"New Delhi, Mar 17 : As the country gears up for the world's biggest electoral exercise, messaging platforms like WhatsApp and social media influencers have emerged as the go to mediums for political parties to influence voter psychology, ad gurus and political analysts say.In the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, political parties are extensively using social media to propagate their achievements and seek support from voters.The BJP is trying to engage with the voters by sending them a personalised 'Letter from the Prime Minister' on WhatsApp—which has over 500 million active users monthly in India—highlighting the achievements of the Narendra Modi Government and seeking feedbacks from voters.The party launched the website 'My First Vote For Modi,' which allows visitors to pledge to vote for Modi and submit a video stating the reason behind their choice. The website also hosts several short videos highlighting the development work done under the NDA Government.On the other hand, the Congress runs a Rahul Gandhi WhatsApp group in which the leader is said to interact with people and respond to their queries.The circulation of WhatsApp information is monitored at the district level to ensure it reaches the masses and corrects the party's voter base.""Whichever political party has higher WhatsApp groups under its banner can communicate faster and better with the voters. It helps them to highlight their achievements instantly with a large user base and influence the voters by drawing parallels with the opposition,"" Amitabh Tiwari, an election analyst and commentator, said.According to Tiwari, Facebook, once the most preferred platform for social media campaigning, has seen a downslide due to many restrictions on advertisements on political pages.Facebook boasts 366.9 million users according to Statistica, a data-gathering and visualisation platform.""Parties opt for social media platforms which help them connect with the masses instantly without much restrictions and have a large user base. There are many other platforms like Instagram or Twitter, which cater to a specific audience and have different formats,"" he said.According to the data from the Election Commission, the Bharatiya Janata Party spent a total of Rs 325 crore for media advertisement (print and electronic, bulk SMS, cable website, TV channel, etc) during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, while Congress incurred an expenditure of Rs 356 crore.After the COVID-19 pandemic, perspective towards social media as a tool of information significantly changed, Ankit Lal, founder of Politique Advisor and former IT Cell head of Aam Aadmi Party, said.""Many political parties now adopt a digital-first strategy for their poll campaigns to connect with the voters who heavily depend on social media to get information. Social media influencers have become another important medium through which parties try to influence the floating audience of those who do not vote but engage in consuming the narratives,"" he said.Social Media Influencers Take The Lead in the last few months, several political leaders have appeared on YouTube channels of popular social media influencers to connect with the younger audience.BJP leaders like S Jaishankar, Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal, and Rajeev Chandrasekhar have given interviews to podcaster Ranveer Allahabadia, who has over 7 million followers on YouTube.In the 2014 general election, BJP had the first mover's advantage in utilising social media for election campaigning as many leaders were not there on these platforms, Tiwari said.""Because others (Opposition) didn't realise the importance of social media for campaigning then, the ruling party was able to create more impact,"" he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi joined X in 2015 (when it was still Twitter) and has 25.1 million followers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who joined X in 2009, is followed by 96.3 million people.Explaining the importance of social media campaigning on poll results, Lal said, ""With the internet penetration of 40 per cent, in an assembly constituency of an average of two lakh people, it is possible to influence 75,000 to 80,000 people through digital mediums. Even a difference of 5,000 votes is a good win-loss margin in any assembly election."" Other analysts, however, have their doubts about the power of social media to turn people into voters.It requires more analysis and research, they say.Chambi Puranik, Professor of Political Science and a poll analyst, said election campaigns on social media may not influence the opinions of traditional voters or party supporters who have their loyalties fixed.He said loyalty factors such as caste and local affiliation weigh far more for traditional voters as the elections come closer. ""The popularity, credibility and charisma of the party face contesting in the election also swing the voters.""Meanwhile, highlighting the need to regulate social media campaigning by parties, former Chief Election Commissioner of India SY Quraishi said that the EC should speak to tech companies to strengthen their mechanism to take down reported posts that violate the rules of the poll body.Tiwari observed that the money spent by parties for campaigns does not necessarily impact who wins or loses.Various factors contribute here, including the party's face, public image, and issues raised by the party, among others, he said.On Thursday, the Election Commission published data on electoral bonds bought between April 2019 and February 2024.According to the data, the BJP received the highest contributions, Rs 6,566 crore or 54.77 per cent, through the bonds, followed by the Congress, which received Rs 1,123 crore or 9.37 per cent of the total.  PTI"

The-first-25-days-of-2024-have-been-no-different-from-the-last-8-months-of-2023-This-is-the-reality-but-can-o,"The first 25 days of 2024 have been no different from the last 8 months of 2023. This is the reality but can one hope to see something different in the remaining months of 2024 ? Equally important and significant to Manipur would be, how long will Prime Minister Narendra Modi continue with his  silence ? Or will the Prime Minister ever take a stand and come out with a formula which may be acceptable to people on either side of the clash divide ? Or has the State Government worked out any formula on its own which can be presented to New Delhi to act upon ? Only questions at the moment and no one will have any answer to this, but as stated in an earlier commentary here, Manipur cannot afford to continue  like this and there are some steps which need to be taken up. And all steps taken up should ensure the interests of Manipur and her people. This is the bottomline. To take the first step towards this, it is then imperative to demonstrate that there is a Government in place here at Imphal. It is only when the Government fails to dispense with its duties that power centres of different hues and colours will emerge and this is what Manipur has been witnessing and experiencing for long. Can Manipur afford to continue with this ? The answer should come from Imphal and Delhi, but with a Prime Minister who has preferred to keep mum, a silence bordering on indifference, no one knows how long such a situation will continue. On the other hand, it stands that the longer the state of unrest, the longer the muscle flexing exercise continues, the longer people’s dissatisfaction with the conduct of the State Government continues, Manipur stands to lose. Such a situation can only add more muscle and teeth to the machinations of those who have openly challenged the very idea of Manipur. A point which Manipur can ignore only to her own peril. The substance and truism of this observation should be clear when viewed against the slogan ‘Peace later, solution first,’ a slogan coined and used to deadly effect by the Committee on Tribal Unity and Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum. From this very slogan it should also be clear to Delhi who stands to gain from prolonging the state of unrest and the spate of violence which keep on erupting now and then at the convenience of one side of the party in conflict. Moreh is a case that comes to mind here.No easy way forward and it has been like this since the evening of May 3, 2023. More than eight months now, and this is precisely the reason why Manipur and the State Government need to stay strong and not dilute the understanding of a Government by playing to the gallery. It should also be clear to all that the world is watching. Manipur was caught napping in the early days of the clash and this is the reason why the false narratives were peddled so successfully. It is armed with the knowledge of this reality that Manipur should proceed with any step to deal with the crisis. Certain demands have been laid down and this is where the Government will need to work out and see which of the demands Delhi can meet sooner and which may come later. Delisting illegal immigrants from the ST list of the Scheduled Tribe list of India will need the conduct of a National Register of Citizens and this is something which will take time. If Delhi is intent and sincere in addressing the issue, it should seriously study the demand that the Suspension of Operation pact with the Kuki militant groups be abrogated. Geo-politics may be important, but more important is the sanctity of the country and how Imphal manages to put forward this point can go a long way in influencing how Delhi responds to this demand. Abrogate the SoO pact, go ahead with preparation to conduct an NRC here in Manipur with the base year put at 1951 and let it be demonstrated that there is a Government in place at Imphal. Manipur has suffered long enough and it is time to rein in all those who have been challenging the existence of the place as a distinct geo-political reality."
Aizawl-Dec-30-Amid-fierce-fighting-between-Myanmar-s-ruling-military-and-resistance-forces-at-least-151-My,"Aizawl, Dec 30Amid fierce fighting between Myanmar’s ruling military and resistance forces, at least 151 Myanmar army perso-nnel crossed the border and entered Tuisentlang village in south Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district Friday with the intent to surrender to the Assam Rifles, ThePrint has learnt.According to a senior Mizoram police officer, personnel of the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadaw, entered Lawngt-lai district with arms after fleeing from their camp in Chin State’s Paletwa in Myanmar, across the international border.Based on a preliminary inquiry conducted by the State police, the Myanmar army base near Parva village — located close to Tuisentlang — was captured Thursday by Myanmar People’s Army, popularly known as the People’s Defense Force (PDF) or the Chin Defense Force (CDF), and the Chin National Army (CNA).The 151 Myanmar army personnel who fled their camp crossed the international border at pillars number 2 and 4, to reach Tuisentlang. More Tatmadaw members are likely to reach the border village, it is learnt.Lawngtlai district police officers told ThePrint that the Assam Rifles have initiated the repatriation process. The surrendered Myanmar army personnel have been taken to Parva, and State police personnel are working in close coordination with the Assam Rifles in border areas.With the entry of these 151 Myanmar army personnel, the number of Tatmadaw members who have crossed the 404-km Mizoram-Myanmar international border to surrender to Indian authorities since 13 November has risen to 255.Camp after camp of the Tatmadaw has fallen to the local resistance militia and CNA forces in Myanmar’s Chin State adjoining Mizoram since 2022, as Myanmar’s National Unity Government in exile called for the overthrow of the military junta by force.Myanmar has been in the throes of civil war since 1948. It was under military rule between 1962 and 2011. In February 2021, the military wrested power again after toppling Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian Government. Now, the junta, as it is called, could be facing its biggest threat yet, in the form of a sustained attack on multiple fronts by ethnic armed groups that include pro-democracy fighters. These attacks have been ongoing since October.The Mizoram police said that the 151 soldiers would likely be flown from Parva to Moreh in Manipur and then handed over to the Myanmar junta, as has been done before.Earlier, 45 Myanmar soldiers who fled from their camps at Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi villages, near the Zokhawthar Indo-Myanmar border trade centre in Champhai district, came to Mizoram on 13 November and were flown back from Hnahlan village the next day.Another group of 29 Tatmadaw soldiers left their camp at Tuibual, near Mizoram’s Saikhumphai village, on 16 November and were flown on 19 November after being stuck at Vaphai Assam Rifles camp because of bad weather.The final group of 30 soldiers was flown from Tuipang helipad in Siaha district on 29 November.

GUWAHATI-Dec-31-Paresh-Barua-leader-of-the-anti-talks-faction-of-the-United-Liberation-Front-of-Asom-or-UL,"GUWAHATI, Dec 31Paresh Barua, leader of the anti-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom or ULFA (Indepen-dent), has termed the tripar- tite peace agreement signed with the pro-talks faction of the outfit as ""shameful"", asserting that ""political settlement is not possible when revolutionaries give up their goals and ideals"".""We are not surprised, concerned or angry but ashamed of the pact. We were aware of the outcome as when revolutionaries give up their goals, ideals and ideology, a political settlement is not possible,"" Barua told Assamese television channel 'Pratidin Time' in a telephonic interview.Asked about Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's conversation with him on possible talks with his faction, the rebel leader said, ""Yes, he did speak to me. He is a catalyst for negotiations. We will not sit for talks just for the sake of it. We have demanded a political settlement and will not waver from this goal and betray the people of the State.""If political demands are not met and only a package is given, it is not acceptable. We have been saying from the beginning that they (pro-talks faction) are proceeding on the wrong path of a so-called arrangement,"" he added.The hardliner ULFA(I), led by Barua, was unwilling to come to the negotiating table unless the issue of 'Assam's sovereignty' was discussed, with the faction engaging in sporadic incidents of violence as security forces intensified operations.Asked whether he had discussed these issues with his former comrades-in-arms, the ULFA(I) leader said the outfit's general secretary Anup Chetia had spoken to him and he tried to convince Chetia about a political settlement but Chetia informed him that this demand was turned down by the negotiators stating ""there was no such provision in the Indian Constitution"".""Did they go for talks without knowing what was in the Constitution? Talks will have to be held outside the ambit of the Constitution,"" he said. Barua claimed that Chetia had told him they had no other option. If there was no other option, they should tell the people that they have been deceived,"" Barua said.Barua further claimed Chetia said he was not there since the beginning of the dialogue process and it was ""not possible to do a correction now"".The ULFA general secretary had joined the talks process after he was released from a Bangladesh jail in 2015 after serving a term of 18 years since 1997.""We cannot cooperate with them (pro-talks faction) as we have not given up our ideals and ideology. We are not sitting at the negotiating table unless there is discussion on the lines of the Naga Framework Agreement, which includes control over resources, a separate constitution and flag,"" Barua said.Regarding missing ULFA leaders and cadres during security operations, including 'Operation All Clear' in Bhutan, the rebel leader said, ""Those who have signed the accord had an opportunity to ask about them (the missing militants), whether they are dead or alive, and if so their whereabouts.""""They should have firmly exerted their right to know the details but when they do not have any ideals left, they will not have the courage to ask these questions,"" Barua added.Referring to a photograph taken after the signing of the accord where the pro-talks ULFA leaders, including its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and general secretary Anup Chetia, were seen standing behind Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior officials, Barua alleged that ""they were denied the basic respect which was insulting for the Assamese community, and this really hurt"".""During the signing of their respective accords, the Naga and the Bodo leaders were seen sitting with the Ministers and officials but I don't know why the ULFA leaders were denied this basic respect,"" he added.A tripartite Memorandum of Settlement was signed between the ULFA (pro-talks) faction, Central and State Governments in New Delhi on Friday in the presence of Shah and Sarma.

The-ground-reality-demands-it-and-Manipur-also-demands-it-This-is-not-the-time-to-identify-political-parties,"The ground reality demands it and Manipur also demands it. This is not the time to identify political parties on the basis of where they sit inside the Assembly, whether on the Opposition bench or on the Treasury bench, but for all to strike a common stand and present a united face to the people. Whether any attempts have been made towards this end or not is best known to the political parties themselves, but it is significant to note that the Congress walked out of the Assembly on March 1, the day the House reaffirmed its earlier stand to update the National Register of Citizens. The Congress has its reason for lodging such a protest and it is best left to the people to decide whether their mode of protest was in line with the need of the time to address the many issues besieging the State or not, but the very fact that the single largest Opposition party decided to walk out should also jolt the BJP to the fact that this is the time to take everyone along. Or if the Kangla Meepham of January 24 is a subject not desirable to be discussed on the floor of the Assembly, the same could have been explained to the Congress. Whatever the case it may be, it certainly did not paint the two political parties in any good light. There is also food for thought in the points raised by Sugnu Assembly Constituency MLA K Ranjit of the Congress, who pulled no punches in asserting that the Chief Minister  did not deem it fit to even pick up the phone and inquire how situation was like at Sugnu, a place which has been hit hard by the ongoing clash. Sugnu AC was amongst the first Constituencies in the State to form a peace committee, the members of who were drawn from different communities and while Manipur went up in flames on May 3, 2023, evening, a sense of peace and normalcy reigned at Sugnu till May 27. And the credit for this should go to MLA K Ranjit, who wasted no time in reaching out to different communities. It was only on May 28 that violence engulfed Sugnu AC and readers and the people of Manipur will know how it became a sort of an epicentre of the violence for quite a number of days. In fact today Sugnu AC stands as one of the most hard hit Assembly Constituencies and MLA K Ranjit has every reason to feel being let down by the Government. One does not expect a direct answer to come from the Government on the points raised by the Congress MLA, but it is significant to note that there are misgivings between some legislators and the Chief Minister and this cannot be good for Manipur as a whole.The challenges before Manipur are many. The ongoing clash between the Kukis and the Meiteis obviously tops the list but there are also other issues which the State Government will need to deal with. The emergence of different power players and power centres is one such reality. This is where the moderates, those who are able to see beyond the immediate and study where Manipur may find itself four or five years down the line need to start raising their thoughts and suggestions. Given the dicey situation at the moment, this will seem too far fetched but how long can Manipur afford to continue like this ? Apart from the need to raise the voice of sanity under the knowledge that the longer the situation is allowed to continue it is Manipur which will lose out more in the long run, it is the Government here at Imphal which should start exploring ways to start the process of talking things over with both sides. This is where the announcement of the Chief Minister that due process has been initiated for a dialogue sounds encouraging.  Letting Nungba AC MLA and Chairperson of the Hills Area Committee of the Assembly D Gangmei get in touch with folks on either side of the clash divide to create a conducive atmosphere to sit down and talk things over is perhaps one of the better news that Manipur has heard in a long, long time. Apart from this, efforts may also be made to get in touch with voluntary organisations such as the United Naga Council, the Naga People’s Organisation of Senapati, Tangkhul Naga Long of Ukhrul, Chandel Naga People Organisation etc and urge them to take up some proactive roles to set the ball rolling for a dialogue. As noted, Manipur cannot afford to continue like this and maybe New Delhi may step in and see what more it can do to defuse the situation."

Kohima-Jan-27Nagaland-Governor-La-Ganesan-on-Friday-expressed-concern-that-the-unresolved-Naga-political-is,"Kohima, Jan 27Nagaland Governor La Ganesan on Friday expressed concern that the unresolved Naga political issue has posed constraints in the development and growth of the state and appealed to all to push for a solution at the earliest.Addressing a Republic Day programme at the Secretariat Plaza here, he said the state government is 'keen for an early solution' to the problem.“Nagaland was formed six decades ago with special Constitutional safeguards that protect the culture, identity and interest of our people. The state has been an active partner in contributing to the overall development and growth of our great nation. However, we are all aware of the constraints posed by the Naga political issue, and the solution to which still eludes us, in spite of the best efforts and good wishes of everyone concerned,” Ganesan said in his Republic Day speech during the state level celebration.However, he thanked all the stakeholders who are working tirelessly to find a peaceful, honourable and acceptable resolution to the issue.While asserting that “the state government is keen and committed to an early solution”, he appealed to all the stakeholders to rise above their differences and to ""make a united final push to arrive at the eagerly awaited solution"".The first breakthrough was made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland, which started around India's Independence in 1947.The Naga political issue is considered one of the longest insurgency problems of the country while the Centre has been holding separate negotiations with NSCN-IM since 1997 and the WC NNPGs since 2017.A framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015, by NSCN-IM and the government. The Centre had in November 2017 inked another agreement with the Working Committee of Naga National Political Groups (WC NNPGs).However, the final solution is yet to see the light of the day mainly because of the unwillingness of the government to accept the NSCN(IM)’s persistent demand for a separate flag and constitution.

Let me tell you that we undertake developmental works as part of a mission to build the nation, not to form a government (by winning elections). We want to ensure that our youth do not suffer what their past generations had suffered. This is Modi's guarantee,"" the PM said.Modi said that in the last 10 years, his government spent around six times more amount for the development of Railways than was done earlier.In just two months of 2024, his government inaugurated and laid the foundation of Rs 11 lakh crore projects, he added.The PM said the railway sector in the country suffered heavily after the country's independence because the past governments prioritised ""political motives"" rather than development.""Earlier, lawmakers used to clap in Parliament over the railway minister's announcement of giving stoppage to a train or increasing the number of coaches. This was the thinking back then. What would have happened if such an attitude persisted in the 21st century too? That is why the first thing I did was to merge the railway budget with the main Union budget so that the Centre's fund is made available for the development of Railways,"" he said.Earlier, it was very common for trains to get late. Everything was left on the fate of the passengers, he said.Till 2014, only 35 per cent of the railway lines were electrified. The common people were suffering due to long queues, agents demanding commission and hours of waiting to get train reservation, the PM said.""I know this very well because I started my life on railway tracks,"" he said.Modi said his government has shown a strong willpower to pull the Railways out of a ""hell-like situation"" and this sector's development is among their topmost priorities.The previous governments did not give priority to the doubling of railway tracks, he said.PTI"

For pedestrians it is also a nightmare as most of the footpaths are piled with goods from the nearby shops, making it impossible to use them while passing through the market areas on foot."

That measure is still pending with the Rashtrapati Bhawan.The State unit is hoping that it goes through and some of the negative perception over the CAB in the State can be ameliorated. The CAB aims at providing a path to Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Parsis and Buddhists fleeing religious persecution from India's neighbouring countries. With a porous border with Bangladesh, North Eastern States have been nervous that it could lead to swamping by Bengali Hindus."

Neeraj-ChopraSportspersons-serve-the-Nation-through-their-dedication-perseverance-and-teamwork-It-is-both,"Neeraj ChopraSportspersons serve the Nation through their dedication, perseverance, and teamwork. It is both a privilege and a responsibility to wear the National colours, whether at home or abroad. But as sportspersons, and young Indians, a part of the world’s most vibrant democracy, there is another privilege we aspire to-that of voting.Elections are the bedrock of democracy, granting citizens the vital privilege to elect their representatives. However, this right is not passive; it is a duty, especially incumbent upon the youth, to actively engage in the electoral process. Historically, young people have spearheaded societal change, and their involvement in elections is crucial. Strengthening democracy requires the active participation of youth at every stage, from voter registration to grassroots campaigning.The first-time voters bring fresh perspectives and champion ideals such as transparency and inclusi-vity. The energy and tech- savvy nature of a young voter inject dynamism into the electoral landscape, fostering accessibility and responsiveness to citizens’ needs. Youth play a pivotal role in holding elected officials accountable, utilising social media to amplify voices and advocate for issues that resonate with the public, thereby safeguarding democracy’s integrity and vitality.In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, “The future depends on what you do today.” As the wheels of democracy turn once again, gearing up for the upcoming general election in India in 2024, it is imperative to underscore the pivotal role that the youth play in shaping the destiny of the Nation.In his monthly radio programme “Mann Ki Baat,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of youth participa- tion in the electoral process, highlighting the Election Commission’s “Mera Pehla Vote Desh Ke Liye” campaign aimed at first-time voters.Urging first-time voters to participate in record numbers, he stressed their crucial role in shaping the country’s destiny. PM Modi called upon influencers across various sectors to join the campaign and motivate young voters, recogni- sing their influential role in driving societal change. Amidst the electoral fervour, he urged the youth to not only participate in political activities but also stay informed about ongoing discussions and debates.The Election Commission of India is spear heading “Mera Pehla Vote Desh Ke Liye” aimed at fostering universal enlightened participation of youth in elections. Union Minister Anurag Thakur launched the campaign anthem, symbolising the Nation’s commitment to encouraging young voters to exercise their democratic right.The initiative is also witnessing Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) conducting comprehensive voter awareness activities nationwide and stressing the value of voting for a more representative democracy.Whereas HEIs are hosting physical events, online competitions are also being organised on the MyGov platform, including blog writing, podcasts, debates, and more, to encourage creativity in content creation. Workshops, seminars, flash mobs, and voter pledge drives are further engaging and educating students on the electoral process, with NSS volunteers and institution clubs actively participating in the campaign.Responding to Prime Minister’s appeal, influencers from across various platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, and the entertainment industry are actively supporting the campaign,motivating the first-time voters. Prominent names from across all corners of the country, who have made a mark in spheres like Sports, entertainment, business and industry, have come together to spread the message far and wide.My fellow sportspersons like Jasprit Bumrah, Ravichandran Aswin, Mohammed Siraj, Avani Lekhara, Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, film personalities industry leaders such as Ritesh Agarwal, BVR Mohan Reddy, and several Padma Awardees have participated in this campaign, turning it into a ‘National movement’ of voter awareness.This ‘people’s movement’ underscores the collective power of voices of the youth and the importance of their active participation in shaping the country’s democratic landscape. Let’s unite in embracing this responsibility and celebrating the strength of our collective voices. Let us rise to the challenge, let us raise our voices, and let us empower others to do the same.As athletes, we are champions of track and field; but as youth, we are ‘champions of change’. For in the game of democracy, every vote counts, and every voice matters.The writer is a track and field athlete and reigning Olympic and World Champion in Men’s Javelin Throw.  Views expressed are personal.  PIB"
K-Yugindro-Singh-M-Manihar-Singh-Sh-Janaki-Sharma1-Compulsive-Reasons-for-enlisting-as-ST-i-After-int,"K Yugindro Singh, M Manihar Singh & Sh Janaki Sharma1. Compulsive Reasons for enlisting as ST(i) After integration of Manipur into India in October 1949, various laws framed by the Government of India have reserved the Hill Areas of Manipur (92%) exclusively for Scheduled Tribes (ST). Meetei, because of being not ST, have been restricted to live only in the tiny Central Valley areas (8%) with people from all communities of different castes, colour, creed and religion including those belonging to Scheduled Tribes.(ii) All land laws currently in force in Manipur including MLR & LR Act 1960, Article 371(C) of Constitution of India, were framed during the period 1950-1972, prejudicially to subdue forever the growth of Meetei under hectic lobby and masterstroke of a crafty Kuki IAS officer who had mind-boggling strategical vision of establishing a ‘Kukiland’ by dismembering Manipur. The malafide long-drawn design of the Kukis may be curtailed by including Meetei in the ST list.(iii) Since the first notification of ST list of Manipur on 20th September 1951, all ST communities of Manipur including the migrant Kukis have developed at a fast pace in all spheres as they have been enjoying all the benefits, rights and privileges meant for STs under the Constitution of India. On the other hand, the socio-economic conditions of Meetei have been deteriorating steadily day by day as they have missed to avail those benefits, rights and privileges extended to STs.(iv) An anomalous situation happening in Manipur is that while the Kukis who are refugees/migrants have been granted Scheduled Tribe status right from the Notification of the first Scheduled Tribes list of Manipur, 1951 with the privileges guaranteed under the Constitution of India, the indigenous Meeteis have been denied to enjoy the Scheduled Tribe status till date although Meeteis fulfill the set criteria for inclusion in the ST list under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India right from Manipur’s merger into India in 1949.(v) Meetei’s holding of land in the Central Valley is continuously shrinking fast due to selling of their land to people of other communities and it stands today just at about 3% of Manipur’s total area. The situation is likely to aggravate faster with arrival of railways and Trans-Asian Highways.(vi) The annual population growth rate of Meetei during the period 1881-2011 was 7.17 which is the least as compared to those of other communities. In particular, the annual population growth rate of Muslim during the same period was 37.03. Since the growth rate of Muslim is more than 5 times that of Meetei, it is obvious that Muslim will overtake Meetei in population in the next few decades. The census data of Manipur for the years 1881 and 2011 reveals an imbalanced picture of demography as shown below:(vii) According to the Report of the 5th National Family Health Survey (2019-2020) conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the Meitei community in Manipur is 1.77. The critical minimum value of TFR required by a community for sustenance of its survival is 2.11. The TFR value (1.77) for Meetei community is much lower than the critical TFR value of 2.11 and it signifies that the population of Meitei is decreasing fast. The low value of TFR is related to poor economic condition of the Meetei community in Manipur. Thus, it is true that the Meitei community is near the verge of extinction at not much distant future, unless drastic corrective measures such as protection under ‘ST’ tag are taken up as soon as possible.(viii) Combining all factors viz, shrinking of land area, declining rate of population growth and low value of TFR, it is readily projected that Meetei will become a minority community in Manipur in the coming decades, that too with no sufficient land to accommodate their populace and subsequently, waiting for extinction in their own homeland Manipur.(ix) Since the British Government of India recognized Meetei as a primitive hill tribe right from the Census of India 1881, as may be verified from many sources of authority such as census reports published by the British Government of India, various books and research articles authored by contemporary British ethnographers, linguists and administrators, the ethnic Meetei community qualifies all the criteria for inclusion as a Scheduled Tribe under Article 342(1) of the Constitution of India.2. What does the Constitution say ?According to Clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, ‘Scheduled Tribes’ are those tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342(1) of the Constitution which says that “The President may after consultation with the Governor of a State, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State.”3. Procedure to be followedThe Government of India, Ministry of Tribal Affairs vide their No. 12026/09/2013-C&LM dated 06.03.2019 addressed to the Home Secretary, Government of Manipur conveyed the following procedure“Government of India on 15.6.1999, and further amended on 25.6.2002, has approved the modalities for deciding the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the Orders specifying list of Scheduled Tribes. According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the State Government/UT Administration concerned, can be processed further. Thereafter, it has to be concurred with the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) for consideration for amendment of legislation. As per extant modalities, recommendation of State Government with ethnographic report in support is pre-requisite for processing the proposal.”4. Ethnography of MeiteiNotably, the British Government of India identified and classed Meitei as a primitive hill tribe of the erstwhile Assam province essentially on the basis of the ethnography of Meetei/Meitei, provided in the Annual Administrative Report for the year 1868-1869 authored by Dr R Brown, the then Political Agent of Manipur. On the ethnography of Meitei Dr. Brown wrote:  “Should it be a correct view that the valley of Munnipore was at no very distant period almost entirely covered by water, the origin of the Munnipories from the surrounding hill tribes is the proper and only conclusion to be arrived at. I think it probable that when only a small part of the valley skirting the hills was capable of cultivation, the hill-men bordering it used to descend and cultivate the little land there then was, returning to their homes in the hills after reaping their harvests: as, however, land increased, some few of them settled permanently in the plain, gradually increasing in numbers. The various tribes thus settling in different parts of the valley would in time come into contact, and, after a struggle for supremacy, amalgamate. That this is what actually did take place is borne out by the traditions of Munnipore.” (Brown, 1870, p.27).The official definition of ‘tribe’  used by the British Govt.  of India is enshrined in authority books such as ‘The Imperial Gazetteer of India, The Indian Empire, Vol. I Descriptive’ by Henry Frowde, Oxford University (1907, pp.308), ‘Census of India, 1901 Volume I Part I – Report’, by HH Risley& EA Gait (1903, pp. 514), ‘The People of India’, by Hebert Risley & W Crook (1915, p.62) etc. The anthropological devices used by the British Govt. of India for identification of tribes and castes were ethnography, ethnology and anthropometry which are well described in authority books such as ‘The Tribes and Castes of Bengal’ by HH Resley (1891).(i) ‘Ethnographical Gallery, Guidebook No. 2 (The Andamanese, Nicobarese and Hill Tribes of Assam)’ by AM Meerwarth, Publisher : Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta (1919, pp. 15-34).(ii) ‘Ethnography (Castes and Tribes)’ by Athelstane Baines, Publisher : Strasburg, Verlag Von Karl J.

The-pro-talk-group-of-the-United-Liberation-Front-of-Assam-ULFA-is-clear-that-granting-Scheduled-Tribe-ST-,"The pro-talk group of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) is clear that granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to five communities of Assam will help save Assam. The greater objective behind this move is to keep the illegally settled Bangladeshis at bay. The argument is simple enough and as reported in a National daily sometime in July last year ST status will ensure land rights for the communities, prevent alienation of land, not to talk about reserved seats in the Assembly of Assam. As widely reported earlier, the five communities are Moran, Matak, Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi and Tai-Ahom, and one is left wondering whether the Meiteis are so much more advanced than these five communities that so many objections should be raised to the demand that the Meiteis be included in the ST list of the Constitution of India. Objections, and as long as the objections fall within the realm of debates and discussions then it should be acceptable to everyone, but when this is used as an alibi to pursue something very dangerous, then it is time to call the bluff. It is on this fabricated premise that the Tribal Solidarity Rally of May 3, 2023 and which kicked off the violent clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis, was staged and the farce of it all should be clear to all. Coming back to the objections and the debates it has kicked off, it should also be clear to everyone that violence has never ever been associated with the movement to demand ST status for Meiteis. Not when the Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee, the World Meetei Council, Meetei/Meitei Tribe Union and others raised the call to include the Meiteis in the ST list of the Constitution of India and this is primarily the reason why The Sangai Express finds it totally unacceptable to toe the line that the Tribal Solidarity Rally was staged against the ST for Meiteis demand. The ruling of the High Court of Manipur was also just a directive to the State Government to send the report to the Centre and nothing more and as argued many times in this column, it is not the job of the Judiciary to decide whether the Meiteis should be granted ST status or not, but Parliament. This is where one is left wondering why such a hue and cry should have been raised against the directive of the High Court to the Government of Manipur. Isn’t the opposition to the directive of the High Court enough evidence that the Meiteis fulfil the criteria to be included in the ST list of the Constitution of India ?Let there be debates and discussions and The Sangai Express has been willingly carrying the diverse viewpoints of different personalities on the said topic. Earlier it was a debate between the World Meetei Council and some members of the All Tribal Students’ Union, Manipur (ATSUM) and soon other personalities too jumped into the debate, each detailing their own points. Such debates are always welcome for it gives more insights to the people but let it be clear to all that ST categorisation is the mantra to ensure a level playing field for everyone. It is also time to look beyond Manipur and understand the competition in the job market in the all India context. Just opposing the case of the Meiteis while turning a blind eye to other cases, such as the most recent move to grant ST status to six communities of Assam, sounds like a farce, a pathetic farce that will fool no one. For the State of Manipur, internal arrangements can always be made, just as the Government of Nagaland has come up with job reservations based on socio-economic status of each tribe. The same approach can and should be applied when it comes to State Government jobs here. Likewise a model for land reservation within Manipur can be explored and implemented. That Meiteis fulfil all the criteria to be tagged a Scheduled Tribe has been spelt out here on more than one occasion with experts and knowledgeable folks having chipped in with their bit. Another interesting development has been the call and the opinion sought from the State Government by the Centre to delist the Kuki-Zos from the ST list of the Constitution on the ground that they are not indigenous to the land. That they are not indigenous to the place but are refugees is a point which has been laid down in black and white by a certain Mr Paolienlal Haokip in a publication of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies way back on May 23, 2002, under the heading ‘Suffering in oblivion : Burmese refugees in North East Region of India.’"
Certain-points-should-be-clear-to-everyone-The-Free-Movement-Regime-FMR-was-implemented-to-promote-free-mov,"Certain points should be clear to everyone. The Free Movement Regime (FMR) was implemented to promote free movement of people across the Indo-Myanmar border and in the process not disturb their daily interactions with people on either side of the international border, promote trading activities and ensure that people with close filial ties do not remain cut off from each other through the border demarcated by the British in the latter part of 1800s. It however never meant that people from either side can be given the leeway to spread out, cut down trees in the forests to make way for human habitation and set up villages on the sly. In short the FMR, which has been proposed to be scrapped, never meant that this is to allow setting up new villages, lead to deforestation and give a totally new understanding to the demographic composition of a place or a State like Manipur. This is precisely the reason why Manipur has raised the demand to update the National Register of Citizens, amid the ongoing clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis. The voice of concern and opposition to the proposed decision to scrap the FMR by the All Naga Students’ Association, Manipur should be understood and it should be taken along with their stand that the FMR should stay along with the conduct of an NRC in Manipur. It should also be clear to all that the FMR means easing the movement along the border but not coming into Manipur to lay claim on ‘ancestral land.’ As one of the two indigenous folks of Manipur, the Naga student body will understand the point that has been raised here. Easing trade and commerce and encouraging cross border contact should not mean giving anyone the license to come, lay claim on a piece of land, clear the forests and hills and set up a village, under a chief. This is something which should be understood in its correct perspective and the call to conduct an NRC here should be seen and understood in the context of the demographic imbalance in the last many decades and in the capability of any particular community to send their representatives to the Assembly. This line should be understood in the context of political representations and political equations, which are so important in today’s world.The voice of concern raised by ANSAM should be understood in its correct perspective and so do too the demand for NRC raised amid the ongoing clash. It should also be noted that the demand of ANSAM not to scrap the FMR is qualified by the words ‘not in Naga areas’ and this is where it would help for all to look back at the demographic composition of Moreh back in the 1970s or before the ethnic clash of 1992-95. If even without the Free Movement Regime the demography of a place along the Indo-Myanmar border can change so drastically, one can imagine how the situation could be like if free movement of people across the border is allowed to carry on for decades. It would help for the Government to study and try to understand the importance of standing against the decision to scrap the FMR and yet back the call for an NRC. View this against the opposition from some quarters to the call for NRC and things should become more than obvious. It would also help to get a better understanding of the gun and fire power that has been demonstrated from the evening of May 3, 2023 at Churachandpur and Torbung. The BJP led Government should go back to the earlier days and study the demographic composition of places like Moreh and understand the call for NRC. It should also study the border area at Kamjong side to get a better understanding of why the Naga student body has called for the FMR to continue in Naga inhabited areas. The very fact that the opposition to scrap the FMR came with the rider ‘in Naga areas’ should say so many important things and this is a point Manipur should understand."
Anand-LaishramAnyone-who-has-been-paying-attention-to-the-news-especially-business-news-or-tech-news-whet,"Anand LaishramAnyone who has been paying attention to the news, especially business news, or tech news, whether in the form of newspapers or online articles or videos etc., will have heard the term “innovation” being used quite frequently.Even if one is not really an innovation manager or an academic studying innovation, even if one is just a casual consumer of news, they are likely to have a few common ideas about what innovation is or what the term connotes.Commonly, innovation is associated with novelty, with imaginative new products/ trends that draw everyone’s attention, that could turn entire industries upside down, the innovative iPhone that unleashed the smartphone revolution and brought the computing power of a supercomputer into a device that fits into one’s pocket.Innovation conjures mental images of scientists working in sophisticated labs or engineers working with sophisticated machines, developing something never seen before. Innovation makes people think of the lone genius, working away quietly in a lab or a garage, who finally comes up with something totally new and possibly revolutionary.The idea of innovation can inspire people, especially young students, who may want to create an impact or develop that revolutionary drug or come up with the next Google (Alphabet) or Facebook (Meta).The same idea can also intimidate people, and can seem like a distant dream, especially for those from the emerging parts of the world.This article is an attempt to clarify the concept of innovation, what it really means, how it can be achieved. It will also attempt to dispel some of the myths surrounding the concept.This article is for everyone in Manipur who is running a business or wants to run a business. It is for the students who want to study business or go into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathe- matics). It is for those who want to see Manipur do better, economically and otherwise, because innovation and economic develop- ment are strongly correlated.Therefore, let’s start by understanding what the concept means. And to do that, we need to consider another related, but different concept, that being “invention.”Invention is what most people seem to conflate innovation with. Invention refers to the creation of a new technology or a new scientific process or principle.Innovation, on the other hand, refers to the successful commercialization of that new technology/scientific process/principle. This can take place through the development of a new product that solves certain problems for consumers, or a new production process that allows existing products to be made in a more efficient manner, thereby allowing more people to buy and access those products.Innovation can also take the form of new business models/new ways of doing business, enabled by new technologies.An example would be Uber. Taxis and taxi service companies existed before Uber arrived. But new technologies and the widespread use of smartphones, allowed a new way of doing business, wherein people could take a ride in a car owned by another person (not necessarily a full-time professional taxi driver) through the use of an app on their smartphone. Passengers could get a taxi ride at drastically lower prices while owners could put their cars to productive use.  Uber, the company, became the largest provider of taxi services in the world, in a very short period, without the need to buy and own fleets upon fleets of cars.Or Airbnb, which became the largest hospitality service company in the world, not by building hotels and making them available to customers, but by leveraging new technologies and taking advantage of the ubiquity of smartphones, to instead allow customers to stay in empty rooms in other people’s houses.Innovation can be radical, meaning a new development that is a massive change compared to what existed before. For example, the first Apple iPhone was a drastic shift away from all the phones that came before.Innovation can also be incremental. For example, each new generation of the iPhone compared to the existing one.In terms of economic returns, incremental innova- tions are just as, if not more, important than the radical innovations that dominate headlines and draw massive media coverage.However, innovation doesn’t always have to be new to the world. It can also be new to the company or new to the local economy.And therein lies the key lesson for the readers in Manipur.Innovation doesn’t have to be only of the new-to-the-world type that can only be achieved in places like the Silicon Valley.Innovation can also be in the local context, through the development of products that weren’t available before in the local market or the use of new machines/technologies/ processes that weren’t used before.Why is that important?Innovation, or more precisely, technical change, accounts for a major percentage of productivity growth, seen in the world, since the first Industrial Revolution. This was demonstrated by the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow.Innovation of the product type can help businesses solve the problems faced by the people of Manipur more satisfactorily. By developing products/processes that are more customised to the requirements of the people in Manipur.Innovation of the process type can help businesses make their offerings more affordable and accessible for the customers in Manipur.Innovation of the business model type, can help businesses solve problems for customers in new ways, based on the opportunities & constraints available in Manipur. An example would be the clever use of WhatsApp messaging and Google Maps by restaurants to serve customers directly.We need businesses to be more innovative if we are to keep growing. The world is changing rapidly, at speeds even humans can’t keep up with today.Manipuri businesses need to keep up or risk falling behind. Manipur produces a significant number of STEM students, has many people working in tech companies or doing cutting edge research. Manipur has promising enterprises and ambitious entrepreneurs.If we adopt the mindset and culture of innovation, of coming up with new products to solve problems in unique ways or solve problems never solved before, if we adopt newer practices & newer technologies, invest in more advanced machines/ equipment, if we develop new business models that will allow meeting the needs of customers in better ways, faster, more affordable, simpler, more accessible etc. and if we keep this going, we will keep growing as a State. Today we contribute a tiny percentage to India’s GDP, but we have the tools and the people to grow a lot more."

By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-12-YWC-Langthabal-and-NAPSA-Kha-Imphal-complete-the-semi-final-line-up,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 12 : YWC, Langthabal and NAPSA, Kha Imphal complete the semi-final line up of the 1st Khomdram (O) Hijam Mema Memorial Veteran Cricket Tournament being underway at Langthabal Public Ground.YWC pulled off a 59-run victory over LCCC, Lilong Chajing to set a semi-final date with Model Club, Chingamakha. They gathered 147/5 after LCCC chose to field first and rode on Kumarjit, Tejkumar and Samananda to destabilise LCCC and bundled them out for 88 runs in 17.1 overs.Sasi 29, Basu 26, Prakashmani 22, Gojendro 21, Kumarjit 13, Bisma 23 not out and Samananda 6 not out fired YWC to 147 in an innings which saw LCCC's Ashok, Krishna and Sanjit sealing a wicket apiece.In the chase, LCCC experienced a collective failure with eight batsmen failing to reach double figures and succumbed to 88 all out as Kumarjit (4/6 in 2.1 overs), Tejkumar (2/15 in 4 overs) and Samananda (2/8 in 3 overs) wreaked havoc across their batting line up. Gulshannanda was the highest run getter for the team with 36 runs to his name and Jinta added 10 runs.Kumarjit of YWC was adjudged man of the match.Meanwhile in the last quarter final match, NAPSA outshone KCC, Kongba by 9 wickets with Somorendro scoring an unbeaten 59-ball 72 to lead NAPSA in the chase of 134 runs for the victory.Put in to bat first, KCC piled up as many as 133 runs for 5 wickets courtesy an unbeaten half century from Iqbal (45-ball 51) and contributions from Sanjoy 24 not out, Robertson 15, Kiran 14 and Devkanta.In reply, Somorendro and Simon (not out 45 off 37) produced an unbroken second wicket stand to steer NAPSA to 136 in 17 overs.For NAPSA, Simon (2/23) and Johni (2/24) shared four wickets as Premananda picked one wicket.Simon who enjoyed a two wicket haul and added an unbeaten 45 was adjudged man of the match.Model Club will play YWC in the first semi-final match on March 14 before CYCLONE play NAPSA in the second semi-final match later in the day."
The-tryst-with-infamy-is-complete-Even-as-former-office-bearers-of-the-All-Tribal-Students-Union-Manipur-mi,"The tryst with infamy is complete. Even as former office bearers of the All Tribal Students’ Union, Manipur minced no words in asserting that the Churachandpur based Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) and the Kangpokpi based Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU) do not carry the mandate of the tribal people, came the news of the office of the ITLF being vandalised in the dead of the night of March 17 at Chura-chandpur. Why the office of the ITLF was targeted is something best left to the investigating agency concerned, but what the former leaders of ATSUM have pointed out is extremely relevant and perhaps it would have helped if this had come earlier, say in the first few days of the violence after it erupted on May 3, 2023. It is there on record that the Tribal Solidarity March of May 3, 2023 was organised under the aegis of ATSUM, but within a blink of the eye, or within the first few matches being struck at Torbung and Churachandpur on the said day, it was the ITLF which emerged in all its ugliness. Same is the case with CoTU at Kangpokpi. The very fact that the former officer bearers of ATSUM admitted to The Sangai Express that the rally wounded up peacefully in the Naga dominated districts of Senapati, Ukhrul, Tamenglong and other places but turned violent only at Chura-chandpur and soon spread to Kangpokpi and Moreh, should be an open and shut case. A case which squarely says that ITLF and CoTU are fronts of the gun wielding elements who took part in the Tribal Solidarity March and led from the front in attacking Torbung and Meitei residences at Chura-chandpur. It was also with a reason why The Sangai Express had on more than one occasion cocked a snook at the move to tag the term ‘Indigenous’ to the name ITLF as well as the intention of putting words ‘Tribal Unity’ as in CoTU. Now with former leaders of ATSUM openly asserting that these two entities do not carry the mandate of the tribal people, The Sangai Express stands vindicated. This is also the stand of Manipur. That the Tribal Solidarity March and the reason cooked up for organising the rally was just an alibi is something which must be clear to anyone who have something between their ears and it is under this lie that ITLF and CoTU have been staying in the limelight and dictating how the people of Churachandpur and Kangpokpi must think, vocalise and even eat, drink and sleep. Goebbels, or to give his full name, Paul Joseph Goebbels surely has dedicated followers who have cooked up the name ITLF and CoTU and managed to upstage him in so far as spreading false propaganda is concerned.Lies, lies and more lies. And it is on the premise of these lies that the call for a Separate Administration has been rung out and obviously the longer the clash continues, the more it would benefit those who seek to tear apart the understanding of Manipur. It is this point which Imphal should understand and acknowledge that throwing one’s weight around and indulging in muscle flexing exercise all under the assertion of doing something for the people amounts to playing right into the hands of these elements who are out there to disfigure Manipur. The politics at play here-the politics of muscle and money power, the politics of one upmanship, the politics of instilling fear and intimidation-and perhaps the mastermind behind these politics must be under the impression that the ongoing violence is the time to assert one’s presence in the lives of everyone. This is what Manipur should be on guard against, even as the fight is on to protect and nurture the understanding of Manipur as a distinct geo- political reality. The focus should be on how to show the ITLF and CoTU for what they are and obviously the manner in which the Tribal Solidarity March of May 3, 2023 was so expertly hijacked and given a totally different direction at Churachandpur is something which need to be told and retold in such a manner that it convinces the people who matter. And certainly letting chaos rule Imphal and cocking a snook at the understanding of the rule of law will run counter to the idea and suggestion of calling out the ITLF and CoTU."
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-21-Even-though-election-notification-has-been-issued-for-both-Inner-Manipu,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 21: Even though election notification has been issued for both Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency and Outer Manipur Parliamentary Constituency, neither the ruling BJP nor the Opposition Congress has made any official announcement on their candidates.Except for CPI’s L Sotinkumar and NPF’s Kachui Timothy Zimik, no other party has officially announced its candidate for the two Lok Sabha seats of Manipur which would go to polls on April 19 and April 26.While L Sotinkumar would contest the election in Inner Manipur PC, Kachui Timothy Zimik would fight in the Outer Manipur PC.Nonetheless, sources informed that Indian National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may announce their candidates for both the Lok Sabha seats on Friday.Though no official announcement has been made as yet, INC is most likely to field Alfred Kangam Arthur in Outer Manipur PC as no other names were forwarded to the AICC by MPCC.Alfred Kangam Arthur has already started informal election rallies in Ukhrul.Although a number of aspiring candidates applied for INC ticket in Inner Manipur PC, JNU Delhi Associate Professor Bimol Akoijam is said to be the frontrunner for the INC ticket, said the sources.Even though the constituent parties of INDIA bloc favour a common candidate, there is no consensus on a common candidate within the alliance at least in Inner Manipur PC as CPI has already named Laishram Sotinkumar as its candidate.While INC and CPI are poised for friendly contest in Inner Manipur PC, there are reports of other alliance partners exerting strong pressure to field a common candidate, said the sources.However CPI has not said anything on whether it would withdraw its candidate or not. Whether CPI withdraws its candidate or not, INC is determined to field its candidate.Some Congress leaders, requesting anonymity, said that the party has already identified its candidates for both Inner Manipur PC and Outer Manipur PC although they are yet to be announced officially.Even though BJP Manipur Pradesh has already forwarded names of four aspiring candidates, the BJP Central election committee has not made any official announcement till date.It is not yet clear whether the BJP Central election committee would choose the party’s candidates from amongst the names forwarded by the State BJP or someone outside the list.Well placed sources informed that the potentials of two individuals are being studied minutely at Delhi. One of them is retired Lt General Konsam Himalay. The other is not a BJP member nor related to the party.Incidentally, the Chief Minister was also projected as a potential candidate in Inner Manipur PC by some quarters.The four individuals whose names were forwarded by the State BJP for party ticket included BJP Manipur Pradesh president A Sharda, Lok Sabha Member Dr RK Ranjan, Rajya Sabha Member Leishemba Sanajaoba and a key political figure.Although two names have been put in the spotlight for the party ticket in Inner Manipur PC, the BJP Central election committee has been deliberating intensively with regard to the Outer Manipur PC. There was even a proposal of supporting the NPF candidate instead of putting up any BJP candidate.Notably, BJP and NPF are partners of the ruling coalition, and the latter has already named Timothy Zimik as its candidate.BJP Central has also been studying another option of fielding a candidate from amongst the Zeliangrong community.Even though it is said that the Kuki-Zo communities have not been talking much about the Lok Sabha elections, the Kuki-Zo commu- nities have been working to field only one candidate.The sources however refused to divulge the name    of the proposed lone candidate of Kuki-Zo commu- nities. Nonetheless, it is being speculated that the pro- posed candidate may be one who fought the Lok Sabha elections earlier in Outer Manipur PC and served as the Manipur unit president of a National party.In view of the protracted violent conflict which erupted on May 3 last year, Kuki-Zo communities are not expecting votes from the Meitei voters of Assembly segments clubbed under Outer Manipur PC in favour of their candidates. As such, they have been planning to fight the Naga candidate(s) by fielding a lone candidate, the sources said.Earlier, well known Congress leader Dr Lamtinthang of Kangpokpi was projected as the lone candidate of Kuki-Zo communities but these days another man has taken his place.The man who is being speculated as the possible lone candidate of Kuki-Zo communities may fight the Lok Sabha election on Kuki People’s Alliance (KPA) ticket, the sources added."
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-20-Shija-Hospitals-and-Research-Institute-SHRI-has-completed-100-kidney,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 20 : Shija Hospitals and Research Institute (SHRI) has completed 100 kidney transplants.SHRI celebrated the milestone with an event  at its auditorium today where people living with transplanted kidneys, representatives of Mohan Foundation and All Manipur Kidney Transplant Association were present.Shija Kidney Care Card was also launched at the function.Speaking at the event, SHRI chairman cum managing director Dr Kh Palin said that 109 kidney transplants have been completed till date.He said that people with chronic kidney disease and a history of renal transplants can register for the Shija Kidney Care Card.Those with these cards would be given 20 per cent concession on laboratory investigations, 10 per cent discount on radiology investigations and procedures and up to 10 per cent discount on medicines.Even though dialysis is covered by CMHT and PMJAY, Erythropoietin is not covered by any of the two.Erythropoietin is an injection generally given to patients soon after undergoing kidney transplants.SHRI would provide this injection to kidney transplant patients free of cost with immediate effect, Dr Palin said.Medicines taken by people after undergoing kidney transplants must be taken for the whole life. SHRI would take up necessary measures to provide these medicines too free of cost, he said.Around two lakh chronic renal diseases are reported across India in a year but not all of them require kidney transplants. Many of them can survive with dialysis, he continued.Out of the two lakh cases, only around 12,000 undergo kidney transplants. A large number of patients who require kidney transplants cannot undergo the same medical procedure on account of various reasons,  unavailability of organ and limited number of donors being the main ones.When a person dies suddenly, eight organs are not dead. If these organs are donated, another person will survive, otherwise the living organs will either be cremated or buried along with the dead body, Dr Palin said.Now organ swapping has been permitted. This would certainly raise the number of kidney transplants, he said.JNIMS has also started performing kidney transplants and RIMS would also follow suit soon, he said.On the other hand, SHRI has been working hard to provide world-class health- care to the people of Mani-pur and beyond.The Governments of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have empanelled SHRI for treatment of their citizens at the hospital.SHRI has already performed more than 100 cornea transplants and it is working to start liver transplants, Dr Palin added."
Sir-I-m-a-young-soul-an-indigenous-resident-of-Manipur-and-a-citizen-of-India-The-return-of-BJP-Government,"Sir,I’m a young soul, an indigenous resident of Manipur and a citizen of India. The return of BJP Government as a “double engine” under the leadership of Pabung N Biren Singh as a single majority in the 2022 Manipur State Legislative Assembly Election gave me several hopes on seeing the progress they have made in the previous term.Unwanted incidents had happened from 3rd May 2023 and now the outcome we see has been horrible. Many events have occurred that could be intervened timely by the Government and save many consequences that we witnessed today. Several Questions come to everyone’s mind “whether the ongoing chaos in Manipur have Government’s hand or isn’t sponsored by some Government machinery ?”I sometimes studied Indian Polity and asked questions to myself many a thousand times “Is this the type of democracy that we want to show to the younger generation?” “Where is the rule of law?” “Is the Constitution a lie to us?”We are in the 21st century where our countrymen witnessed Digital India 2.0 and on the verge of achieving $5 trillion Indian Economy in the next few years. Yet in Manipur banning internet has become a regular tool for the Government to curb any undesirable event since decades undermining the growth of digital era in the field of technology, education, trade etc even when some States have proposed to include “right to internet” as a Fundamental Right and some institutions statically showed with figures about the loss in the economy for the same.We have heard many successful stories and exemplary acts by the Indian armed forces in the past both domestically and internationally but where are they when the State needs them the most. We have 4th largest military and advancing equipment in the field of technology, but what is the use of it when her State was burned and many civilians were dead. Isn’t the Central Government capable of controlling some areas of 22327 sq. km and some sections or % of 2855794 population of Manipur (census 2011) which merged with her (India) in 1949 ? Or Is the violence a plan by the Government for a specific purpose to be served?Manipur become a full fledged State in 1972. We are lagging behind (now) in many fields like education, per capita income etc. Taking the field of education, in Manipur modern education was started in 1890s. Manipur University came in 1980 as a State varsity and later became a Central University in 2005. On the other hand, Universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were set up in 1857, Punjab university in 1882 and Allahabad University in 1887. Despite this people of Manipur are putting their best foot forward. COVID-19 gave devasting impact to the student’s community as a whole around the globe including Manipur. Students in Manipur faced irreparable loss during Covid pandemic yet they are facing similar loss due to present man-made disaster (violence happening today). Youth and students are the pillars of our country but in Manipur they are facing another dimension of loss in their career due to inadequate actions of the Government.I saw hope, future and prosperity in the eyes of the youth and students of Manipur but now I see terror, violence and destruction in their eyes which will last many years and its impact many decades. Government should take up immediate appropriate action to curb the present menace otherwise the future of our younger generation is doomed which is a loss for our country.Yours faithfully,Tongbram Shivaraj SinghImphal."

For CHPC, Pritam scored the first goal in the first chukker and Bhupendrajit scored the second in the second chukker.Abung scored twice in the third chukker to give RKPC a 6-2 lead before L Rohit scored his second in the last chuker  which also saw Manisana add one for CHPC.In another quarter final match of the day, UYPC rallied back to edge out Major Karan Polo Club (MKPC), Kakwa 9-7.MKPC enjoyed a 5-3 lead after two chukkers but UYPC rode on Th Nongpoknganba's briliance to pump in three goals apiece in the last two chukkers to seal the 9-7 comeback win.S Bimol scored thrice for UYPC (one each in the first two chukkers and one in the last chukker) as Alex Aheibam and S Saolin scored a goal each respectively in the first and the third chukker.For Major Karan Polo Club, Kh Sushilo scored five goals alone including three goals in the second chukker as Riyakat Ali and M Kuber scored a goal apiece in the first and the third chukker."
The-clash-between-the-Meiteis-and-the-Kukis-continues-The-silence-of-the-Prime-Minister-continues-And-Manipu,"The clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis continues. The silence of the Prime Minister continues. And Manipur continues to sink deeper and deeper into the abyss of  confusion, madness and lawlessness with everyone under the impression that anyone with the necessary muscle and gun power can cock a snook at the law. This is the pit and one wonders if such a situation would have been allowed in any other State of the country. The fallout is there for all to see. It is chaos everywhere and as usual it is the media again which has been placed at the firing range of different power players, forcing the print and local electronic media to shut shop for two days. Not the first time that the media in Manipur has been caught in such a situation and there is nothing to suggest that such a thing would not happen in the coming days. This at a time when the Imphal based media has been increasingly dubbed a Meitei media with the Editors’ Guild of India leading the way. Obviously there is no magic mantra to resolve the situation and put Manipur on the track of normalcy, but the least that everyone concerned, particularly the different power players, can do is not to make matters worse by throwing their weight around and expecting everyone to toe their line. Ideally the energy of all concerned should be focused on how to neutralise the forces which are hellbent on compromising with the idea of Manipur but when one’s ego and one’s personal inclination and likes and dislikes are allowed to ride over the more pressing issues facing the people and the land, the script is ready to drive one more nail into the understanding of Manipur as a distinct geo-political reality. Remember the demand for a Separate Administration raised by the 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs still stands and now is actually the time for all concerned to pool their thoughts together and work out strategies to meet the challenge ahead. The SoO pact is set to be reviewed and possibly extended when the term of the agreement ends on February 29, and with the growing demand that the pact should be abrogated, the focus of all concerned should be on the pact. However when the game of one upmanship, stooping to the level of even claiming a precious life, continues, then rest assured Manipur is witnessing the scripting of a tale which can mark the beginning of the end of the place.  There seems to be a method behind the madness that has engulfed Manipur since the evening of May 3, 2023, and this should inevitably raise the question of what the State Government has been doing in the last 10 months.The task at hand is tough and as observed earlier here, one does not expect a magic formula to resolve the situation. It is however important for the Government to take cognizance of the fact that apart from resolving the ongoing clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis, equal attention will also have to be paid to let the rule of law prevail. With the emergence of different power players all over the State, no one seems to know who exactly is calling the shot. This is what is scary and has given a big push to what is generally understood as anarchy. Manipur will have to work doubly hard to ensure that its credibility is not erased and the emergence of different power players, each with its own set of agenda coupled with muscle and gun power, will first have to be acknowledged. It is only after the reality is acknowledged that corrective measures can be taken up, but the question is whether the State Government will have the sincerity and the political gumption to acknowledge the reality. For too long the law has been hijacked and it is time for the Government to convey the message that it is there to govern. And obviously governing or governance is something far removed from the understanding of tough talks and hot air. Acknowledge the reality. Mark the emergence of different power players and take steps not to leave any vacuum in governance, for it is only when such vacuums are created that forces will emerge to fill up the vacuum. This is what Manipur is witnessing presently. Manipur definitely deserves something better than what is being dished out almost on a daily basis, since May 3 last year."
-Nagaland-Govt-rejects-Guv-RN-Ravi-s-observation-on-failure-of-law-order-,"KOHIMA, Jul 4Nagaland Government has termed the claims on failure of law and order in the State made by Governor, RN Ravi as “non-factual” and even rejected the latter’s assess-ment stating that his obse- rvations “do not appear to be factual”.Ravi had previously penned a serious letter to Chief Minister, Neiphiu Rio highlighting the extortion and disregard for law and order by rebel groups where it was mentioned that “arm-ed gangs” are running and ruining the State’s welfare.Nagaland’s Department of Information & Public Relations (DIPR), in reply to the Governor’s appeal, said that the State's law and order situation is normal so far.Recalling how the Naga indigenous tribe attained Statehood, the Information Department said that the State was born out of so much hardship and remains to be so. It also informed on the pending and unresolved peace talks which have been going on with Naga Political Groups (NPGs) since 1997.The DIPR said incidents of serious and heinous crimes in Nagaland have seen a gradual decrease over the years, and efforts are on to minimise them.Ravi had warned that he would act as per the provisions of Article 371A  (1)(b) of the Constitution, which gives him special power to take the responsibility in his hands. In respect to his warning, the DIPR replied that this law  was ruled out by a resolution in December 2013.“The State Government is of the view that any decision to put the clock back in contravention of such a resolution in the guise of discharging special responsibilities under Article 371(A)(1)(b) would be against the principles of democracy and viewed as anti-people,” the statement added.

The commando team caught one person who was inciting the mob and later identified him as Md Sattar @ Ithem.After convincing the locals, the commando team searched the house of Tahish Khan and spotted one black plastic bag just outside the house.On checking the black plastic bag in the presence of witnesses the cops found 3.136 kilograms of brown sugar wrapped in a white cloth inside the plastic bag.On enquiry Md Sattar disclosed that his son in law Bogimayum Tahish Khan is a big drug dealer and also revealed that on seeing the commando team, he alerted his son in law and concealed the drug just behind the back door of the house.   The recovered brown sugar was seized after observing necessary formalities in the presence of witnesses and Md Sattar was arrested and handed over to Wangoi police station for necessary action."
By-Our-Staff-ReporterIMPHAL-Mar-19-Hard-work-always-pays-off-and-such-is-the-case-of-Ebumna-Farmer-s-Grou,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Mar 19 : Hard work always pays off and such is the case of Ebumna Farmer's Group which has been giving a source of income to dozens of people in Chandel district by letting them plant turmeric on large tracts of fields.Despite still employing many women, the farmer's group has lately become a  shadow of its former self like many other business establishments due to the situation the State has been in since the evening of May 3, 2023.Despite the downturn, the farmer's group has been showing entrepreneurial resilience and is still hopeful that better days will come.Based in Salamthar village near Komlathabi in Chandel, Ebumna Farmer's Group was established three years back.Speaking to The Sangai Express, chairman of Ebumna Farmer's Group HB Kobor Anal said that they used to let different self help groups of women plant turmeric at Machi Sub-Division (5 hectare approx), Saibol (2-3 hectare approx), Khudei Khullen (5 hectare approx) and at 15 different villages before Manipur was hit by a series of crises triggered by the madness Manipur saw on the evening of May 3 last.He said  that Ebumna Farmer's Group procures the raw turmeric at around Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg depending on the season and availability.Saying that drying the turmeric takes about a week, Kobor Anal continued that five kilograms of turmeric can normally produce about a kilogram of dried turmeric.He further stated that they used to sell the dried turmeric at around Rs 140 to Rs 150 per kg to companies outside Manipur and got about Rs 5 or Rs 6 (profit) per kilogram before violence broke out in Manipur on May 3, 2023.Kobor went on to state that they got the inspiration to plant turmeric widely after one  non local bought 200 kilograms of turmeric from them and spoke highly of the quality of the turmeric planted in their area.About four companies based outside Manipur used to buy dry turmeric in bulk regularly before clash erupted in Manipur, Kobor Anal said and rued that the companies have stopped ordering for dry turmeric due to the situation in Manipur.Even if there is order for dry turmeric, there is a problem in transporting the turmeric due to  frequent imposition of bandhs and blockades, Kobor Anal said.He said that the content of curcumin is lower in turmeric grown in Chandel as compared to the Lakadong turmeric of Meghalaya.Saying that they used to  produce about 200 metric tonnes of turmeric annually, he added they can now grow only about 30 metric tonnes of turmeric owing to the situation and sell them at Pallel, Thoubal and some other places.Ebumna Farmer's Group employs a few dozen women to wash, slice and dry the turmeric and give them about Rs 300 to Rs 400 per person daily.The machine used to slice turmeric was bought at Rs 50,000, he added.Saying that they haven't received any assistance from the Government as of yet, Kobor Anal continued that they also sell ginger but couldn't make much profit from it.Ebumna Farmer's Group also procures cinnamon from people at the Indo-Myanmar border at around Rs 110 to Rs 120 per kg, he said."
It-was-a-political-decision-and-it-is-with-a-political-objective-that-New-Delhi-has-continued-with-the-Suspens,"It was a political decision and it is with a political objective that New Delhi has continued with the Suspension of Operations (SoO) pact with the armed Kuki groups coming under two broad groups, the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and the United People’s Front (UPF). The political decision may be understood in the context of the fact that the peace deal or dialogue deal was inked though the Kuki armed groups had never ever raised its hands or trained its guns against the Indian security forces or demanded anything that falls outside the Constitution of India. So why was the peace deal signed then ? Different theories have been doing the round, such as the pact falling within the larger political objective of the Government of India to neutralise the Naga armed movement spearheaded by the NSCN (IM) and later the other Naga armed groups which have come under the NNPGs and the Manipur armed groups or Meitei rebels. There could be other reasons, such as leveraging the changing political dynamics in Myanmar, more so after the latest military coup and the armed revolt launched by different ethnic armed groups in the neighbouring country. The growing clout of China in Myanmar and India’s Act East Policy and the larger political ambition of spreading its influence and clout in South East Asia, of which Myanmar is the gateway in so far as India is concerned could be another reason. Nothing has been laid in black and white on why SoO was first inked between New Delhi and the Kuki armed outfits in 2005 with Imphal made to come on board in 2008 and since then it has traversed the path of others known as peace process with an Interlocutor being appointed and the pact being renewed every year by the end of February. Call it a coincidence for want of a better term, but even as the Manipur Assembly passed the resolution to urge the Centre to scrap the SoO pact, there has been no official statement on whether the pact has been extended, as is normally announced by February 28 or in the case of a leap year by February 29. Manipur has solid reasons to demand that the SoO pact be scrapped or abrogated and the push given to this demand as the Gregorian calendar inched towards the last day of February this year should underline this point but the matter of greater import is whether the State Government will be able to present a politically viable proposal before New Delhi to have the pact scrapped. Early days as yet, but remember this is the first time that the State Assembly has taken such a decision and this significance is something which should be sold to the powers that be at New Delhi in a convincing manner. Perhaps this is where the political acumen of Chief Minister N Biren and his men will be tested. A test by fire, one may add.That the SoO cadres have been violating the groundrules of the pact should be clear and the groundrules is one of the fundamentals of the pact. What evidence the State Government has been able to collect on this count remains to be seen but to the people of Manipur, this is something as clear cut and simple as 2+2 equals 4. Go back to the Tribal Solidarity March of May 3, 2023 and the video recording of gun toting men in full battle fatigues taking part in the rally has gone viral on the social media. Eyes don’t lie and New Delhi too must have taken note of it. Plus no one would buy any story that the sniper rifle that was fired and killed Moreh Police SDPO Chingtham Anand on October 31, 2023 was executed by a village volunteer. Ask anyone well versed with the use of firearms or a jawan of the Assam Rifles or Border Security Force and the standard reply would be that it takes a trained person to be able to fire a sniper rifle with such precision. Plus the attacks launched on the security personnel and  State police personnel at the border town should leave no one in doubt of the involvement of motivated persons who could only have been trained in the use of firearms. If not the SoO outfits then which entity would have the expertise and the resources to train such persons ? Just some points that come to mind, but remember the Assembly has already taken a decision and approaching the Centre to get it abrogated will need political acumen and present a case not only on behalf of Manipur but also on how it poses a threat to the integrity and sovereignty of India."
It-certainly-evokes-a-mixed-feeling-Of-course-we-are-referring-to-the-Chief-Minister-s-appeal-to-the-people,"It certainly evokes a mixed feeling. Of course, we are referring to the Chief Minister’s appeal to the people not to create troubles in the valley districts and entrust the responsibility of protecting the State’s unity and integrity to the government. The first part of the appeal is okay. It is the second part which is problematic and hard to digest. The failure of the state vis-a-vis the current violent crisis is stark and unmistakable. The state failed miserably not once, not twice but repeatedly. The failure of the state started even before the pre-planned and premeditated aggression erupted and it is still unable to fully discharge its responsibilities and duties. A few days after the offensive was launched and Meiteis were attacked from all directions, Chief Minister N Biren admitted that there were security lapses as well as intelligence failure. The failure of the state started when it failed to apprehend the sinister intention and objective of the so-called Tribal Solidarity Rally, particularly the one planned and taken out at Churachandpur on May 3, 2023. This failure of the state proved to be extremely costly to thousands of innocent people as well as to the idea of Manipur as a whole. It is also equally perplexing and shocking that the state (state here refers to both Imphal and New Delhi) and its armed forces did not make any attempt to stop the infamous Churachandpur rally, participated by armed hoodlums and automatic rifles-wielding combatants, from making its way to Torbung Bangla. Once they reached Torbung Bangla, it was total mayhem. Hundreds of houses were vandalised and burnt down within minutes. Again, neither the state nor its armed forces made any attempt to stop the mayhem. Such is the abject failure of the state. Even after buffer zones were created to contain the violence, Kuki militants managed to sneak into Kwakta after crossing a buffer zone manned by security forces and slew three sleeping men on August 5, 2023.The terror attack at Kwakta is not any isolated case of the state’s failure to protect its citizens. There are several instances of Kuki militants sneaking into Meitei villages and murdering innocent villagers. To recall a few incidents, four villagers who went to collect firewood were murdered by Kuki militants on January 10, 2024 at Kumbi Haotak. This was followed by the gruesome murder of four other innocent villagers at Ningthoukhong Kha Khunou on January 18. The list of the state failures is simply too long. It is the repeated failures of the state which compelled untrained villagers to shoulder the responsibility of defending their villages. The villagers are no combatants but they have no other option. All civilian youth who have taken up arms are not combatants nor are they trained in using firearms.  But the sustained offensive launched by Kuki militants and their supporters, and the state’s miserable failure to  respond appropriately compelled the youth to take up arms  and shoulder the responsibility of defending the integrity of Manipur. Had the state and its security agencies protected the unarmed civilians from the heavily armed aggressors, no one might have thought of looting weapons from the state armoury because they would have no need for weapons. If civilians arming themselves is a headache to the state, it is the state’s own making. Civilians arming themselves is neither a good sign nor desirable but what is even more disappointing is the state’s failure to protect its citizens. It is the state’s failure which enabled Kuki militants and their supporters to cleanse Meiteis from Churachandpur, Kangpokpi and Moreh. Coming to the appeal of the Chief Minister to entrust the responsibility of protecting the state’s unity and integrity to the government, many would like to question if the state is in a position to effectively defend its citizens from the aggressors, even if it is not ready to neutralise them completely."
NSCN-K-announces-ceasefire-returns-to-peace-talks,"Kohima, Dec 23Naga insurgent group NSCN-K, led by dreaded militant Niki Sumi, on Wednesday announced a ceasefire and said that it has contacted the Central Government for initiating peace dialogue.The NSCN-K had signed a ceasefire with the Centre in 2001 but unilaterally abrogated it in 2015 when the then ‘chairman’ of the group, SS Khaplang, was alive.Sumi is the prime accused in the killing of 18 Indian Army soldiers in Manipur in 2015 and the National Investigation Agency had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for his head.In a statement, Sumi said the NSCN-K has been striving all these years to achieve an honourable and acceptable political solution to the Naga issue and the group is also conscious of the overwhelming sentiments among the Naga people for an early solution to this long standing matter.It said that the NSCN-K is aware of the “sincere and genuine efforts” made by the Central Government in the recent past to find a final and lasting solution to the Naga issue with the involvement of all the stakeholders.“Therefore NSCN has resolved to strengthen and support the peace process at this crucial juncture. Our leaders have established contact with the officials of Government of India in this connection.“To facilitate the process and keeping in view the desire of the Naga people particularly Naga civil society organisations and NGOs, the NSCN has further decided to revive the ceasefire with immediate effect by revoking the earlier decision of unilateral abrogation of the ceasefire in 2015,” the statement said.The group also said that it expected the Central Government to respond positively by honouring the group’s decision as a confidence building measure in the larger interests of peace in Nagaland and Naga people in general.A Home Ministry official said, “this is the last group of Indian origin leaders and cadres operating from Myanmar.“Their joining peace process will give a boost to Naga peace process as the remaining chunk of NSCN-K is Myanmar centric and is irrelevant to the Government,” the official said.The other dominant group–the NSCN (IM)–had entered into a ceasefire agreement with the Central Government in 1997 and since then engaged in peace negotiations.The NSCN (IM) had signed a Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015 in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find a permanent solution.The Framework Agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India’s independence in 1947.However, the talks with the NSCN (IM) is currently going nowhere as the group has been insisting for a separate Naga flag and Constitution, a demand rejected by the Central Government.PTI"
-We-have-seen-our-mothers-go-around-and-collect-the-bodies-of-our-fathers-and-uncles-We-don-t-want-a-repeat-of-the-,"DIMAPUR/KOHIMA/NEW DELHI, Oct 6""We have seen our mothers go around and collect the bodies of our fathers and uncles. We don't want a repeat of the situation,"" says Sawmi Leyri, joint secretary of Naga Mothers' Association (NMA).NMA has ceaselessly worked for peace over the decades by requesting and bringing militant organizations to the negotiation table. ""What we want is peace, to raise healthy children in loving, warm homes,"" says Leyri.The sense of fear is palpable, as people believe the Naga peace talks could be at a make-or-break juncture. Nagaland's new Governor RN Ravi, who is also the Interlocutor for the peace talks with NSCN(IM) - the biggest Naga rebel group - and seven other outfits, called Naga National Political Groups, said in August that he had been given three months by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to wrap up the negotiations.""Before my appointment as Nagaland Governor, the PM had expressed the need to conclude the peace process within three months time... that is a long enough time because we have been talking and negotiating for the last 22 years,"" Ravi was quoted as saying in Kohima by media outlets. The NSCN (IM) has been in talks with the Government since it signed a ceasefire agreement in 1997.Nagaland has been caught in phases of violence since the 1950s due to a secessionist movement and armed struggle for self-determination.Hopes were brightened and a solution to the protracted Naga political issue seemed inevitable with the signing of the Framework Agreement between NSCN (IM) and the Centre in August 2015.But the issue has become much more complicated after special status of J&K was withdrawn last month that also did away with its flag and statute. A separate flag and a Constitution are among the core demands of NSCN(IM).""The Framework Agreement is yet to have its fruition as the Government of India is going slow in taking its stand on core issues (of Naga flag and Constitution)... Without these two core issues solved, any solution would be far from honourable because Naga's pride and identity is deeply entrenched here,"" the NSCN(IM) said in a press statement reacting to Ravi's three-month-deadline remark.The outfit also complains of ""aggressive postures"" by Assam Rifles and says that ""the pictures are almost back to pre-ceasefire period"". With both sides unrelenting, people fear violence and bloodshed could return to their lives.""Naga women have never experienced lasting peace. We have never known the life that other people are living,"" says 60-year-old Ramyola Duidang, who had joined the rebel Naga Army in her teens and has handled various sophisticated weapons while fighting on the eastern Nagaland front.Her husband, 'brigadier' Brunning, was killed in a factional fight in 1988, eight years after their marriage. Ramyola now heads the Naga Freedom Fighters' Widows Welfare Foundation, which works for around 400 women whose husbands were members of NSCN (IM) and lost their lives either fighting the security forces or in internecine clashes.""We are on our own. There is no major financial support from NSCN (IM),"" says Ramyola, who single-handedly brought up her two daughters. Her eldest daughter is now married to an Indian Army Major. ""A full-blown armed conflict in Nagaland is the last thing we want. How can I even imagine my son-in-law, who is more than a son to me, to be my enemy?"" she adds.This precarious situation is not new. Women in Nagaland, across all tribes, have walked this tightrope, for ages. Often, they had the mortification of watching their family members (father and brothers' village ranged against that of husband and in-laws') on two opposite sides of warring groups, baying for one another's blood.Naga women, the worst victims of violence through generations, have bled, wept and, inevitably, shouldered the full burden of the healing too.But never have they been silent spectators, taking up the spear or the white flag, as the situation demanded. Their contributions, though, have gone largely undocumented.World's 'Oldest' Peace GroupThe NMA has played a pivotal role in getting Nagaland out of the worst phase of bloodshed with its members trekking for days to camps of proscribed outfits in Myanmar and bringing them to the talks table. Men were scared to venture to those camps, so the responsibility fell upon the women.""The first initiative into Burma jungles to initiate peace was led by then NMA president Neidono Angami and secretary Khesheli Chishi who went to meet NSCN (Khaplang) to get them into a ceasefire,"" says NMA adviser Rosemary Dzuvichu.In January last year, Abeiu Meru, president of NMA, and Dzuvichu travelled to the Khaplang faction's headquarters in Taga in Myanmar to meet top leaders for cessation of hostilities. The 11-day journey to and from the NSCN(K) camp was through jungles and made on foot, motorbikes and boats. The proscribed militant outfit has carried out several attacks on Indian security forces. This January, the Khango Konyak-led faction of NSCN(K) joined the peace talks with the Centre. ""The time and circumstances that followed were responsible for bringing them to think of the appeals from this side seriously and move for ceasefire,"" says Dzuvichu.But this isn't a recent phenomenon. Naga women have for centuries worked as peace activists and that is what gave rise to 'Phukhareila', which, according to Tangkhul expert, Awo Varah, can be termed as one of the oldest peace efforts in the world.Inter-village or inter-tribal marriages have been common in Naga society. So, it was common for daughters of one village being the daughters-in-law in another. All Naga tribes are very territorial, and most battles they have fought have been over land.So, when two villages, despite repeated talks and negotiations, failed to sort out differences, they used to decide upon a time and place where all the able-bodied men of the two villages would fight and decide the winner.""Women of the villages went to an elevated spot near the designated battle zone and, from a distance, watched their brothers, fathers or husbands slaughter each other,"" says Varah.After one group won decisively, these women rushed down to intervene. ""Using fork-shaped branches, they pushed aside the machete-wielding men, telling them that they were the victors and there was no need for further bloodshed,"" Varah says. ""Even in the heat of the moment, the men heeded to these women,"" he reminisces.Naga women, cutting across tribes, have played a dominant role in conflict resolution through generations, says Toshimenla Jamir of the Sociology Department of Nagaland University. ""Through these efforts, women appropriated whatever public space was available to them in the patriarchal Naga society,"" Jamir says. Women, known as 'demi', have played commendable role as mediators in resolving inter-village feuds even in situations where no man dared to intervene.Naga women have not confined themselves to the role of peace activists alone, they have been active combatants too.""Our political history has been very silent on women's contribution to the Naga movement for decades. In the mid-50s, women joined the struggle in huge numbers, as leaders of the women's wing of the Naga National Council (NNC), as active combatants, and as couriers collected rations in villages and supplied food to the armed men in far-away locations,"" says NMA's Dzuvichu, who's also the head of the Department of English at Nagaland University.The NNC, which was formed in the 1940s, has fought for Naga sovereignty and is the parent organization from which outfits like the NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K) sprung up.""We are a nation by right. Our country belongs to Nagas,"" says Adinno Phizo, president of NNC and daughter of Angami Zapu Phizo, the father of armed struggle in the North East.The NNC under AZ Phizo had declared a ""Federal Government of Nagaland"" in 1959 and formed a military wing to take on the Indian security forces. The NNC, which is currently part of the peace talks with the Centre for a solution to the vexed Naga issue, still maintains a small army.""Every Naga is an NNC member by birth. We have active members across Nagaland but desist from maintaining a full-scale army to avoid conflict with other Naga outfits. When the need arises, every Naga will rise for NNC,"" says the 85-year-old Adinno, who lived for decades in exile in London with her father.A small team of armed 'Naga Army' members is stationed near her house in Kohima. Naga Army men in larger numbers are said to be based at the peace camp in Chedema, on the outskirts of the State capital.Adinno believes she is the head of a functional Government. ""Our Parliament, or Tatar Hoho, has two to three sessions in a year and we get monetary support from the people to sustain our army and the Government,"" she adds.But Adinno isn't very hopeful about the Framework Agreement signed between NSCN (IM) and the Centre in 2015. ""How can leaders of an outfit who have been hosted by the Indian Government in Delhi freely negotiate for the Naga people,"" she asks. Adinno didn't marry and chose to ""live for the cause"". Does she expect to see the results she wished for in her lifetime? ""We leave it to God,"" she says.Nothing much has ever been written about the contribution of the women cadre of NSCN (IM) or any other Naga outfit. Nor have the struggles of the war widows been documented.Mercy Shimray's husband, 'captain' Ashang, was killed in 2001 by police in Assam. That was just after four years of their marriage. She brought up her three children with the money she earned from weaving and making pickles.""We widows are standing on faith,"" she says at the NSCN (IM) Peace-Monitoring Cell in Dimapur. Her eldest son is pursuing a bachelor's degree in science in Hyderabad.Asked what would she do if any of her children wants to join the armed struggle, she says: ""My husband has made the supreme sacrifice. If my sons want to join the movement, I will tell them to struggle differently. You don't need to pick up arms to serve the cause. There are more powerful weapons.""And do the war widows see any glimmer of hope that enduring peace might come to Nagaland?""We have fought a long war and both parties now understand that it is a political problem and it has to be resolved politically.That reinforces our belief that there will be an end to the conflict soon,"" says Ramyola.Times of India"

KOHIMA-Mar-1The-fourth-session-of-the-14th-Nagaland-Legislative-Assembly-in-its-concluding-session-on-Frid,"KOHIMA, Mar 1The fourth session of the 14th Nagaland Legislative Assembly, in its concluding session on Friday, passed a resolution on the Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar Border.The House resolved to request that the Government of India to work out regulations for the movement of people across borders in close consultation with the people inhabiting the border areas and for suitably bringing in the village council authorities concerned in the entire system of regulations.Nagaland Deputy Chief Minister Y Patton, who also holds charge of Home and Border moved the resolution.The resolution stated that the recently announced decision to suspend the Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar border and also to fence the Indo-Myanmar by the Government of India, will cause immense hardship and inconvenience and also agony to the Naga people living in the Indo-Myanmar border areas due to the fact that the traditional land holding system straddles across the international border in many areas. People also have to cross the international border on a daily basis for their normal cultivation activities.It stated that these measures will seriously disrupt the age-old historical, social, tribal, and economic ties of the Naga people living on both sides of the international border.""Now, therefore, in view of the special and unique situation mentioned above, this House, hereby, resolves to request the Government of India to reconsider its decision, and to abandon the plan of suspending the FMR and fencing along the Indo-Myanmar border,"" it stated.Earlier this month, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced for ""immediate suspension of Free Movement Regime (FMR)"" between India and Myanmar to ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India's North Eastern States bordering Myanmar.""It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's resolve to secure our borders. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has decided that the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar be scrapped to ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India's North Eastern States bordering Myanmar.Since the Ministry of External Affairs is currently in the process of scrapping it, MHA has recommended the immediate suspension of the FMR,"" Shah said in the post.The 1,643-km-long India-Myanmar border, spanning Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, currently operates under the FMR, which permits individuals living near the India-Myanmar border to travel 16 km into each other's territories without a visa. Initiated in 2018, the FMR policy was a component of India's Act East Policy.  ANI"

Interesting-stage-one-may-say-The-Big-2-have-not-yet-announced-their-candidates-either-in-the-Inner-Parliam,"Interesting stage, one may say. The Big 2 have not yet announced their candidates, either in the Inner Parliamentary Constituency or the Outer Parliamentary Consti- tuency but this has not stopped numerous ‘poll pundits’ from coming forward and sharing their thoughts and ideas, all based on speculations. And perhaps no other Lok Sabha election has elicited as much interest as this time around and one just has to look back at 2019, 2014, 2009 and 2004 in the current millennium to get an idea of the point that is being sought to be made here. This is particularly true in the case of the Inner Parliamentary Constituency and one does not need to look far to understand why this is so. The day for all voters to remember is May 3, 2023 and the days that followed thereafter and despite the mayhem, the deaths, the displacement of thousands, one positive that can be pinpointed is the realisation of the people that they are as much political beings as the professional politicians. It has also awakened quite a large number of people to the immense responsibility they have in sending their representative to the floor of Parliament and hence the talk seems centred around the ability, the professional expertise of the intending candidates, their background, their past conduct and this is something which Manipur badly needs at this point of time. One only hopes that this trend sustains for years to come and does not get blown away by the ‘enticements’ usually offered in the run up to any election. How were the interests of Manipur put forth before the audience during the height of the conflict is a question that each voter must ask himself or herself. How did the stand spelt out by the respective intending candidates go to deflate the false narrative that had been lapped up across the country during the initial days of the conflict ? In short how were the interests of Manipur succinctly put across the discerning folks of not only the country but across the world ? Remember the ethnic conflict had come up for discussion in the European Parliament. All these are immediate points that need to be kept in mind and much will depend on how the voters exercise their choice. It is also important for everyone to keep in mind that the button they push on the EVM on voting day will go a long way in how the interests of Manipur will be presented on the floor of Parliament. This is a point which should have ideally been raised in all the past Lok Sabha elections that Manipur has seen, but the need to reiterate this is not felt as much as now.Just five days to go for the nomination papers to be filed on March 27 and while the BJP and the Congress have not officially named their candidates, all plans must have been drawn up. It also stands that the candidate the BJP names can have a bearing on the ongoing ethnic clash and it is not likely for the Central leadership of the BJP to have missed this. How it goes about addressing this point remains to be seen but the prognosis of Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju some time back that the issue will be resolved after the Lok Sabha elections is significant. The hows and  whys ‘after the LS polls’ were not spelt out, but it is in the unspoken that so many possibilities can be read into, adding more interest in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections. As stated in an earlier commentary here, the Lok Sabha election will be a sort of a referendum on the BJP led Government at Imphal especially on its dealing with the ethnic clash and the steps it has taken up to address the grievances of the people. To the Congress, perhaps this is the best time to capitalise on the situation given that the violence has dragged on for 10 months and despite the deaths of over 200 persons, many missing, thousands displaced and houses razed and levelled to the ground, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not uttered a single word, other than the outburst when two girls were paraded naked in the initial days of the violence. Will the voters vocalise their stand against the silence of the Prime Minister is a point which the Congress will surely try to capitalise on. On the other hand the BJP too will capitalise on the suspension of the Free Movement Regime, the decision to fence the Indo-Myanmar border and the fact that the popularly elected Government has been allowed to continue despite the ten months old violence."
What-is-the-way-forward-Manipur-obviously-cannot-continue-to-live-like-this-and-it-is-more-than-obvious-that,"What is the way forward ? Manipur obviously cannot continue to live like this and it is more than obvious that more ought to be done to start the process of normalcy. It was with a reason why Lt General (Retd) Dr Konsam Himalay vociferously batted for the  idea of a dialogue between the two warring communities. How to start the process of talking things over is the duty of the Government and Imphal and Delhi should take note of this. Other than the Government, it is also imperative for people on either side of the clash divide to sincerely look for ways to sit down and talk things over the table. This is where the service of personalities like Dr Konsam Himalay can be utilised. It was more than a month back that the former Army officer talked about the need for a dialogue during an interaction with The Sangai Express and fast forward to the first day of the second month of 2024 and there is nothing to suggest that anyone is making any effort to start the process of talking things over. Far from coming anywhere near the understanding of sitting down and talking, Manipur continues to see deaths and more deaths regularly. Take the recent standing call from the ‘Kuki volunteers’ not to sell anything to State police personnel at Moreh and things cannot get worse than this. In less than 48 hours, Manipur would have completed nine months of the violence, with over 200 killed, thousands of folks forced to become refugees in their own land and having to live in relief centres, many more missing and Imphal and Delhi clueless about what should be done to defuse the situation. This is the reason why The Sangai Express has repeatedly questioned the continued silence of the Prime Minister and to many the continued silence reflects a mindset of utter indifference. The silence of the Prime Minister speaks so much about where Manipur stands in the overall scheme of Delhi and this cannot be good for anyone in the long run. A nudge or a push from the Prime Minister can go a long way in setting the ball rolling for a dialogue, a need which has been more than made clear by Dr Konsam Himalay in his interaction with The Sangai Express on December 24, 2023.Dialogue is the way forward. There can be no other way. No one will emerge a winner from the ongoing clash. This is a given and something which everyone on either side should acknowledge and see how to take things forward. Delhi should initiate the process for a dialogue between the two communities at war. Other States, such as Assam and Nagaland can perhaps step in and see how to bring the two sides to the negotiating table. Given the reality and looking back at the past nearly nine months, it should also be clear that the lop sided stories championed in other parts of the country will only lead to further prolonging the crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis, a real crisis that is being played out there, more so at the foothill areas. Dialogue is the only way forward and as stated many times in this column, for dialogue to become a reality, all should stop selling fabricated tales, to suit their own agenda. All should also realise the fact that the longer the crisis continues, more deaths and more missing persons will only lead to the loss of Manipur.  How long can Manipur continue to be in a state of war and conflict ? Time to reflect on this and recall what the first Lt General from the amongst the Meiteis advocated not so long back. The lethargy shown by the political leaders of Manipur too should be addressed for it is they who the public will ultimately hold responsible in the final analysis. It should also not be overlooked that while the Nagas have been maintaining a neutral stand, the clash would have also impacted on their lives and this is something which all should acknowledge."

India will be building Coastal Surveillance System in Bangladesh which will be the second surveillance system to be built by New Delhi in the neighbourhood after the Maldives.As many as 20 units are expected to be placed by New Delhi and the aim is to increase Bangladesh's maritime domain and keep an eye on the shared Indo-Bangla coast. PM Modi said, ""India-Bangladeshi ties are an example of good neighbourly ties"" with PM Hasina saying ""cooperation will be strengthened in future.""Both PM Modi and Bangladeshi PM inaugurated three projects in energy, skill and social areas through remote control. On the energy front, Dhaka will be providing India, LPG to the northeastern states by using Bangladeshi trucks. This PM Modi said the project will be a ""win-win"" for both sides. This will be the second ""energy bridge"" after the ""maitree pipeline"", a 130 km pipeline which will connect Siliguri in West Bengal to Parbatipur in Bangladesh.The leaders also inaugurated e-plaque for Bangladesh-India professional skill development institute at the institute of diploma engineers Bangladesh, Khulna and Vivekananda Bhavan at Ram Krishna mission Dhaka.At least 12 projects have been inaugurated by both sides in last year including three on Friday and nine through video conference in the last few months. Seven agreements were exchanged including MoU on withdrawal of 1.82 cusecs of water from Feni river by India for drinking water supply for the Sabroom town in Tripura.Contentious issues including Teesta were discussed by both the leaders. PM Sheikh Hasina highlighted that the ""people of Bangladesh are awaiting early signing and implementation"" of Teesta waters sharing agreement, to which PM Modi informed that ""his government is working with all stakeholders in India for the conclusion of the agreement soonest possible.""Both sides are looking to ink the agreement for water sharing for seven rivers--Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Feni River. Prime Minister Modi appreciated ""Bangladesh’s generosity in sheltering and providing humanitarian assistance"" to Rohingya refugees displaced from Myanmar.New Delhi will soon supply the fifth tranche of humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. India has been providing assistance since September 2017 under operation 'Insaniyat' for which PM Hasina conveyed gratitude of the Bangladeshi government.The NRC or citizen's roll in Assam was raised by the Bangladeshi side to which, according to sources, an Indian government official said, ""Matter did come. We pointed out that it was the ongoing process and we have to wait for the outcome. It's court-mandated and court directed.""There was a passing reference of developments in Kashmir and revocation of special status during Hasina-Modi talks and Bangla- desh's ""clear position which is appreciated by New Delhi and their statement is on record"", the government source further said.SAARC was not discussed in Modi-Hasina meet, although BIMSTEC was discussed with both sides agreeing ""to streamline the activities of BIMSTEC""To boost people to people ties and connectivity, Bangladesh has decided to remove restrictions on products being traded through Akhaura- Agartala port. Frequency of Maitree Express has been increased from four to five times per week and that of Bandhan Express from one to two times per week. Both sides have agreed on the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the use of Chattogram and Mongla Ports for movement of goods from India's northeast to rest to India over Bangladeshi territory.PM Modi likely to visit Bangladesh in March 2020, on the occasion of 100th birth anniversary of the father of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will take place and this could be the occasion of PM Modi's visit.A government source said, ""we keen to participate in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Birth Centenary in 2020"" and ""an invitation has been extended and accepted."" Bangladeshi PM last week participated at the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in United Nations in New York.The issue of high onion prices was not raised during PMs level meeting but India's trade minister Piyush Goyal has assured that all contracted supplies to Bangladesh in the pipeline should go through as soon as possible. On Friday, Bangladeshi PM publically highlighted the high cost of onions in her own country after India banned the export of the staple. Zee News"
GAZA-CAIRO-Dec-10Israeli-tanks-battled-their-way-to-the-centre-of-Khan-Younis-on-Sunday-in-a-major-new-push,"GAZA/CAIRO, Dec 10Israeli tanks battled their way to the centre of Khan Younis on Sunday in a major new push into the heart of the main city in the southern Gaza Strip.Residents said tanks had reached the main north-south road through the middle of Khan Younis after intense combat through the night that had slowed the Israeli advance from the east. Warplanes were pounding the area west of the assault.The air rumbled with the constant thud of explosions and thick columns of white smoke rose over the city, which is sheltering hundreds of thousands of civilians who fled other parts of the enclave. As morning broke near a city-centre police station, the constant rattle of machinegun fire could be heard. Streets there were deserted apart from an old woman and a girl riding on a donkey cart.“It was one of the most dreadful nights, the resistance was very strong, we could hear gunshots and explosions that didn’t stop for hours,” a father of four displaced from Gaza City and sheltering in Khan Younis told Reuters. He declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.“In Khan Younis tanks reached Jamal Abdel-Nasser Street, which is at the centre of the city. Snipers took positions on buildings in the area,” he said.Israel launched the storm of Khan Younis this week after a truce collapsed, extending its ground war to Gaza’s southern half in a new, expanded phase of its two-month-old campaign to wipe out Hamas militants. International aid organisations say this has left the enclave’s 2.3 million people with nowhere to hide.At the site of one Khan Younis home that had been destroyed by bombing overnight, relatives of the dead were combing the rubble in a daze. They dragged the body of a middle-aged man in a yellow T-shirt from under the masonry.“We prayed the nighttime prayer and went to sleep, then woke up to find the house on top of us. ‘Who’s alive?!'” said Ahmed Abdel Wahab.“The civil defence forces came and rescued who they could, and this is what’s left. Three floors above collapsed down and the people are under it. God is our saviour and the disposer of our affairs. My mother and father, my sister and brother, all of my cousins.”Israel rejects ceasefireMilitant group Islamic Jihad, allied to Gaza’s Hamas rulers, said its fighters were battling Israeli forces in the area. The Israeli military said it bombed underground tunnel shafts in Khan Younis and attacked a squad of Palestinian gunmen preparing an ambush, but said nothing about any tank advance there.Both sides also reported heavy fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Israel had previously said its troops had mainly succeeded in their mission last month. Explosions rang out at dawn there and columns of smoke could be seen from across the fence in Israel.Israel vowed to annihilate Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, after militants burst across the fence on Oct. 7 and went on a rampage through Israeli towns, gunning down families in their homes, killing 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages.Since then, Gaza’s health authorities say at least 17,700 people have been confirmed killed in Israeli strikes, with thousands more missing and presumed dead under rubble. The toll no longer includes figures from northern parts of the enclave, beyond the reach of ambulances and where hospitals have ceased functioning.The vast majority of Gaza’s residents have now been forced from their homes, many fleeing several times with only the belongings they can carry. Israel says it is doing what it can to protect them, but even its closest ally the United States says it has fallen short of those promises. An Israeli siege has cut off supplies, with the United Nations warning of mass hunger and disease.At an international conference in Doha, capital of Qatar which acted as the main mediator for a week-long truce that saw more than 100 hostages freed, Arab foreign ministers criticised the United States for vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday that demanded a humanitarian ceasefire.Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said the war risked radicalising an entire generation across the Middle East.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he would “not give up” appealing for a ceasefire.“I urged the Security Council to press to avert a humanitarian catastrophe and I reiterated my appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared,” Guterres said. “Regrettably, the Security Council failed to do it, but that does not make it less necessary.”Israel has spurned demands it halt the fighting. Briefing his cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had told the leaders of France, Germany and other countries: “You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas, and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas.”Washington has backed Israel’s position, rejecting any ceasefire as a step that would only benefit Hamas. But with the death toll soaring and U.N. agencies warning of humanitarian catastrophe, other Western allies have balked: France voted in favour of the U.N. ceasefire resolution and Britain abstained.

Dipak-KurmiManipur-a-State-that-has-seen-its-fair-share-of-unrest-and-conflict-finds-itself-once-again-tee,"Dipak KurmiManipur, a State that has seen its fair share of unrest and conflict, finds itself once again teetering on the edge of instability. As tensions mount, a 48-hour general strike has gripped the region, sparked by the controversial arrest of three top leaders from the Pambei led United National Liberation Front (UNLF).The events unfolded on the morning of March 13th, when an SUV was stopped near Kwakeithel in Imphal by a joint team comprising members of the Manipur Police Commandos, Assam Rifles, and personnel from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in civilian attire. The individuals apprehended were no ordinary citizens but rather high-ranking officials of the Pambei led UNLF– Thokchom Shyamjai, the Army Chief, Laimayum Ashok, the Chief of Intelligence, and Salam Ibomcha, another intelligence cadre.The arrests have sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from various civil society organizations, including the Federation of Civil Societies (FOCS) Manipur, an umbrella organization representing 12 other groups. They have condemned the arrests as a violation of the ceasefire agreement signed between the UNLF and the Indian Government on November 29, 2023, a historic moment hailed by Union Home Minister Amit Shah himself.The UNLF, formed in 1964, has been engaged in a long-standing struggle against the Indian state, seeking to liberate Manipur. However, the Pambei led UNLF agreed to a ceasefire last year, signaling a potential shift towards peace and reconciliation after decades of conflict. The recent arrests have not only jeopardized this fragile truce but also ignited a firestorm of protests across the valley.As dusk fell on the day of the arrests, the clanking of electric posts echoed through the streets of Imphal, serving as a rallying call for women to take to the streets. Thousands of women bearing flaming torches gathered, halting vehicles and urging businesses to close their shutters in solidarity with the arrested leaders.The FOCS and its affiliated groups have demanded the unconditional release of the trio within 24 hours and had called for a 48-hour (curtailed to 24 hours later) general strike across the State. The situation is further complicated by the involvement of the NIA, a powerful Central agency, known for its uncompromising stance on granting bail to those in its custody.Chief Minister Biren Singh has attempted to distance himself from the arrests, claiming innocence and stating that he is in contact with the Central leadership, urging for the earliest release of the arrested leaders. However, the involvement of Manipur Police officers in the operation raises questions about the State Government’s role in the incident.The Pambei led UNLF cadres have responded defiantly, brandishing weapons in public and threatening retaliation against the police for their involvement in the arrests.Observers suggest that the Indian Government’s decision to ink the ceasefire agreement with the Pambei led UNLF was not solely based on their firepower or cadre strength but rather an attempt to encourage other groups to follow suit and return to normal life.However, the recent arrests have cast a dark shadow over these fragile gains, jeopardizing the prospects for peace in the strife-torn State of Manipur. The NIA’s involvement and the likelihood of prolonged legal battles further complicate the situation, raising fears of escalating tensions and potential retaliatory actions from the Pambei led UNLF (cadres.As the general strike unfolded, the people of Manipur find themselves caught in the crosshairs of a conflict that has plagued their State for far too long. The successful resolution of this crisis will require not only the unconditional release of the arrested leaders but also a concerted effort by all stakeholders to uphold the spirit of the ceasefire agreement and pave the way for lasting peace and reconciliation.(The writer can be reached at[email protected])"

Bengaluru-Feb-11-Asserting-that-he-could-prove-that-the-state-s-treasury-is-not-empty-because-of-the-guarant,"Bengaluru, Feb 11: Asserting that he could prove that the state's treasury is not empty because of the guarantee schemes, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday challenged Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is in the state, to participate in a public debate with him.Mr Shah arrived in Mysuru this morning and visited Chamundeshwari temple in the Chamundi hills and attended a fair before participating in meetings with state BJP leaders to discuss preparations for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.Countering Mr Shah's alleged claims that the state government's treasury is empty because of the guarantee schemes, Siddaramaiah said, ""If this is Amit Shah's firm opinion, he should participate in a public debate with me. I can prove that our treasury is not empty because of the guarantee schemes, and instead, there is an unfair distribution of taxes from the Centre to the state. This is also a challenge to Amit Shah.""Accusing BJP leaders of trying to ""destabilise"" the guarantee schemes of his government, the chief minister questioned if they harboured hatred for the people of Karnataka and claimed that those opposing them will not get the blessings of Goddess Chamundeshwari and will not have the mercy of Lord Ram.""If there are any objections to the guarantee schemes, BJP leaders should clearly state their opposition immediately, and announce that all guarantee schemes will be discontinued in the states governed by the BJP. Why are BJP leaders trying to destabilise guarantee schemes in Karnataka? Do they harbor hatred for the people of Karnataka,"" Siddaramaiah asked.The chief minister also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""stealing"" the state's guarantee schemes, including the word 'guarantee' and ""advertising"" it under the same name, despite allegedly opposing them.In a statement released by his office, he called out the hypocrisy of BJP leaders opposing guarantee schemes in Karnataka on one hand, and promising to implement similar ones in states they govern on the other. ""This shows the anti-poor stance and intellectual bankruptcy of that party (BJP),"" he said.Claiming that the BJP leaders' real opposition is not the guarantee schemes, but the beneficiaries of these schemes - the poor - Siddaramaiah alleged that there is a history of BJP and the Sangh Parivar opposing programmes intended for the needy.""Even when the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi called for 'Garibi Hatao' (Eradicate Poverty), the same RSS-BJP opposed it. They have always opposed social justice programmes including land reforms and reservations. The poor should give a fitting reply to this,"" he said.To buttress his claims, Siddaramaiah alleged that the Central government, which had refused to provide rice for the state's 'Anna Bhagya' scheme (an additional 5 kg free rice for every member of BPL household), is now selling the same under the brand 'Bharat'.He also claimed that during his first term as chief minister, the BJP leaders had shown their ""intolerance and jealousy"" towards welfare programmes introduced for the poor.""The Central government, which had refused to provide rice at ? 33 per kilo when we (Karnataka govt) asked (for free supply to poor), is now selling it at ? 29 per kilo. In summary, the BJP is intolerant towards the poor, farmers, women, and workers of Karnataka,"" he added.Opposition to the Kannada flag, attempts at Hindi imposition, and the conspiracy to favour Amul over Nandini (state's milk brand) are all ""achievements"" of Amit Shah, the chief minister said.""If the Central government has to provide disaster relief, a high-level committee meeting chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah has to decide. Amit Shah, who is antagonistic towards Kannadigas, does not even call for such a meeting. Such people come to our state and lecture us,"" Siddaramaiah said.PTI"
Lahore-Dec-10Pakistan-s-former-prime-minister-Nawaz-Sharif-on-Saturday-said-he-was-ousted-from-the-governme,"Lahore, Dec 10Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday said he was ousted from the government in 1999 by (late) Gen Pervez Musharraf for opposing the Kargil misadventure, as he underlined the importance of having good relations with India and other neighbours.The three-time prime minister questioned why he was ousted from the office of the prime minister prematurely.""I should be told why I was ousted in 1993 and 1999. When I opposed the Kargil plan saying it should not happen... I was ousted (by Gen Pervez Musharraf). And later what I said proved right,"" Mr Sharif said here while talking to the aspirants of his party tickets for upcoming polls.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader said that on all three occasions being the premier he was delivering but he was sent packing and that he did not know why.""I want to know why I was ousted every time,"" he asked.Mr Sharif also talked about the visit of two Indian prime ministers to Pakistan only when he was the prime minister of Pakistan.""We have delivered on every front. During my tenure as PM, two Indian prime ministers visited Pakistan. Modi sahab and Vajpayee sahab had come to Lahore,"" the former prime minister said, stressing improved relations with India and other neighbouring countries.""We will have to improve our relations with India, Afghanistan, and Iran. We need to make more stronger relations with China,"" Mr Sharif said.He regretted that Pakistan lagged behind its neighbours in economic growth development.Lashing out at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party's jailed former chairman Imran Khan, Mr Sharif said he did not know why an inexperienced man was given the reins of the country.""The economy witnessed a downfall during Imran Khan's government (2018-2202). Then the Shehbaz Sharif government took over in April 2022 and rescued the country from default."" Mr Sharif reiterated his demand for accountability of former military generals and judges for ruining the country by ousting his government in 2017.""Those who brought this country to this level should be made accountable as patriotic people can't do this to their country,"" he said.On Friday, Mr Sharif had said: ""We do not want to come into power to roam around in luxury cars but we want accountability of those (who) ruined this country and made false cases against us.""A month before his return to Pakistan after four years of self-imposed exile in the UK, Mr Sharif had hinted at bringing former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, former ISI head Lt-Gen Faiz Hamid, and former chief justices of Pakistan Saqib Nisar and Asif Saeed Khosa for their crime of ousting his government and causing economic disaster.Mr Sharif is holding meetings daily to award party tickets for the February 8 general elections next year.

BEIJING-Dec-14China-has-mediated-peace-talks-between-Myanmar-s-ruling-military-and-rebel-groups-and-the-pa,"BEIJING, Dec 14China has mediated peace talks between Myanmar’s ruling military and rebel groups, and the parties agreed on a temporary ceasefire and to maintain dialogue, Beijing said on Thursday.“China hopes that concerned parties will exercise maximum restraint and together realise the soft landing of the situation in Myanmar,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.The fighting, largely in northern Shan State, has caused worry in neighbouring China. Around 300,000 people have been displaced since a rebel offensive began on October 27, according to the UN, which says more than 2 million people have been made homeless since Myanmar’s military coup in February 2021.The talks were held in China in recent days, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement, without giving more details.China hopes that the parties concerned in Myanmar will implement the agreements and the consensus reached, exercise maximum restraint and take the initiative to ease the situation on the ground, it said.“China has been working tirelessly to stop the war and promote talks among the relevant parties in Myanmar, and has pushed for the de-escalation and cooling-down of the situation,” Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.Mao said there had been a marked decline in the number of clashes and exchanges of fire in northern Myanmar, “which not only serves the interests of the relevant parties in Myanmar, but also contributes to the maintenance of tranquillity along the China-Myanmar border”.Myanmar’s military had said on Monday it met with the rebels and other parties in the conflict, and another round of talks was due by the end of the month, without elaborating.On Wednesday, however, the ethnic minority insurgent alliance reaffirmed its commitment to defeat what it called Myanmar’s “dictatorship”, and made no mention of peace talks or a ceasefire.Beijing is a major arms supplier and ally of the junta but ties have been strained in recent months over the junta’s failure to crack down on online scam compounds in Myanmar that Beijing says target Chinese citizens.The rebel alliance comprises three groups–the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and the Arakan Army (AA).The alliance has taken over 200 military positions, including several towns in Shan and western Rakhine State, since the start of the offensive, dubbed “Operation 1027,” after its launch date, October 27.Myanmar has over 130 ethnic minority groups spread across seven major ethnic states.  Reuters"

Ranjan-K-BaruahThere-may-be-different-definitions-of-happiness-or-being-happy-No-one-may-exactly-define-wha,"Ranjan K BaruahThere may be different definitions of happiness or being happy. No one may exactly define what happiness means, as definition may vary from person to person and community to community. It is a positive and pleasant emotion, ranging from contentment to intense joy. Moments of happiness may be triggered by positive life experiences or thoughts, but sometimes it may arise from no obvious cause. The causes may be different for different reasons as there is no definite cause or reason that would make someone happy. It is really challenging to be happy but people are living to be happy and enjoy every moment though many do not get the opportunity to live happily.The General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution 66/281 of 12 July 2012 proclaimed 20th March as the International Day of Happiness (IDH), recognizing the relevance of happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world and the importance of their recognition in public policy objectives. It also recognized the need for a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes sustainable development, poverty eradication, happiness and the well-being of all peoples.The resolution was initiated by Bhutan, a country which recognized the value of National happiness over National income since the early 1970s and famously adopted the goal of Gross National Happiness over Gross National Product. It also hosted a High Level Meeting on ""Happiness and Well-Being: Defining a New Economic Paradigm"" during the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.It’s a day to be happy, of course ! Happiness is a fundamental human goal. The United Nations General Assembly recognizes this goal and calls for “a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes the happiness and well-being of all peoples.” World Happiness Report 2024 lands on 20 March, to mark the UN’s IDH.Governments and international organizations should invest in conditions that support happiness by upholding human rights and incorporating well-being and environmental dimensions into policy frameworks, such as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The effectiveness of Governments in upholding peace and social order, as well as in the fields of taxation, legal institutions and delivery of public services, strongly correlates with average life satisfaction.One of the interesting projects related to happiness began in 2014 by UNESCO Bangkok. It is the Happy Schools Project which offers an alternative approach to improving learning experiences by prioritizing school happiness. By focusing on well-being, engagement, and sense of belonging at school, the Happy Schools Project helps foster a lifelong love of learning. In 2022, a guide and toolkit were developed. The Happy Schools Project is going global with its advocacy for prioritizing well-being and happiness in schools, with renewed focus on bettering learning experiences.Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) led by its Chief Executive Member Shri Pramod Boro has started a community happiness programme. It has launched the happiness mission to spread happiness and bring more unity and amity amongst different communities living in the region. Under the happiness mission different activities are being carried out to spread the importance of happiness. The international day aims to make people around the world realize the importance of happiness within their lives.All of us should try to be happy and we must concentrate on activities which make us happy. Being positive in attitude shall help one to be happy. Negative person may not always be happy. Happiness matters because when people are happy then only society and Nations prosper. Poverty must end from the earth because poor people may not always be happy. Not only poverty but all other negative things must be eliminated from the planet to keep people happy.

New-Delhi-Dec-27Scientists-have-developed-an-electrically-conductive-soil-which-they-say-can-lead-to-50-p,"New Delhi, Dec 27Scientists have developed an electrically conductive ""soil"" which they say can lead to 50 per cent more growth of barley seedlings on average in 15 days.This soilless cultivation method, known as hydroponics, uses a root system that is stimulated electrically through a new cultivation substrate.""The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it's clear that we won't be able to cover the food demands of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods,"" said Eleni Stavrinidou, an associate professor at the Linkoping University in Sweden.""But with hydroponics we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings,"" Stavrinidou said.The team developed an electrically conductive cultivation substrate, tailored to hydroponic cultivation, that they call eSoil.Their research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that barley seedlings grown in the conductive ""soil"" grew up to 50 per cent more in 15 days when their roots were stimulated electrically.Hydroponic cultivation means that plants grow without soil, needing only water, nutrients and something their roots can attach to - a substrate.It is a closed system that enables water recirculation so that each seedling gets exactly the nutrients it needs. Therefore, very little water is required and all nutrients remain in the system, which is not possible in traditional cultivation.Hydroponics also enables vertical cultivation in large towers to maximise space efficiency. Crops already being cultivated in this manner include lettuce, herbs and some vegetables.Grains are not typically grown in hydroponics apart for their use as fodder.In the latest study, the researchers show that barley seedlings can be cultivated using hydroponics and that they have a better growth rate thanks to electrical stimulation.""In this way, we can get seedlings to grow faster with less resources. We don't yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it's not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process,"" said Starvrinidou.Mineral wool is often used as cultivation substrate in hydroponics. Not only is this non-biodegradable, it is also produced with a very energy-intensive process, the researchers said.The electronic cultivation substrate eSoil is made of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, mixed with a conductive polymer called PEDOT, they said.This combination as such is not new, but this is the first time it has been used for plant cultivation and for creating an interface for plants in this manner, according to the researchers.Previous research has used high voltage to stimulate the roots. The advantage of the Linkoping researchers' ""soil"" is that it has very low energy consumption and no high voltage danger.Stavrinidou believes that the finding will open the pathway for new research areas to develop further hydroponic cultivation.""We can't say that hydroponics will solve the problem of food security. But it can definitely help particularly in areas with little arable land and with harsh environmental conditions,"" she added. PTI"

IMPHAL-Oct-11-The-CorCom-has-called-a-general-strike-all-over-Manipur-Kangleipak-on-the-National-Black-Day-,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Oct 11: The CorCom has called a general strike all over Manipur (Kangleipak) on the ‘National Black Day’ (October 15) from 6 am to 6 pm.A statement issued by the CorCom publicity committee appealed to all the people to observe the National Black Day in complete manner by suspending all normal daily activities during the general strike hours including trade and commerce, games and sports, movement on public roads and all forms of entertainment programmes.Medical services, emergency services, media and religious activities would be exempted from the purview of the general strike.After the lapse of British paramountcy, and when India did not have a Constitution of its own, Manipur had drafted its own Constitution, election was held and an elected Government was formed.Under the Manipur Constitution Act 1947, a democratic election based on universal adult franchise was held in August 1948. Subsequently, a 54-member independent Manipur Legislative Assembly was elected.King Bodhachandra opened the first Manipur Legislative Assembly on October 18, 1948 and the responsibility of State administration was handed over to the Chief Minister and his council of Ministers, said CorCom.But the following year, Bodhachandra was called to Shillong and he was kept there under house arrest by the Government of India. The Government of India forced the king to sign Manipur Merger Agreement there under duress, threats and all kinds of coercion on September 21, 1949.Later Manipur was taken within the Indian Union forcibly on October 15, 1949 without consent of the people and the elected Government which was already there, the CorCom recounted. Thus Manipur which existed as an independent Nation in South East Asia for thousands of years was reduced to the humiliating status of a district within the Indian Union.Since the time of the deceitful merger till date, people of Manipur have been opposing the Indian rule and they have been fighting a war of liberation, said CorCom.Several conferences, conclaves, seminars, workshops and public meetings held across the State at different points of time unanimously resolved that the Manipur Merger Agreement is invalid from legal perspective and it was not merger but annexation, alleged the CorCom.Now it has been 70 years since India ‘annexed’ Manipur soon after a democratic Government was set up in the State. During these 70 years, GoI has been suppressing the people of Manipur politically, economically and culturally, it alleged.At the same time, Government of India has been following a policy of population invasion with diabolic objective to render the indigenous communities minority in their own homeland and ultimately exterminate them, it further alleged.The death or survival of all the indigenous communities would be determined by the ongoing liberation movement, it said while appealing to all the people to join the liberation movement."

The ECI posted a brief statement on X (formerly Twitter) that said dates for four Assembly polls-scheduled to be held around the same time-would also be released.The Model Code of Conduct will come into force from the time the dates are announced. The 2019 election was held over seven phases from April 11 to May 19, with results declared four days later.The four States expected to vote in April/May are Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Sik-kim; Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand scheduled to vote later this year. Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, are also set to vote, in line with a Supreme Court order directing the conduct of Assembly polls by September 30 as the first step towards restoration of Statehood.In a first, the poll panel has given 24-hour notice of a press conference to announce voting dates, polling phases, and other details, including deployment of security personnel in States where post-poll violence and clashes with Maoist or rebel forces is a factor that needs to be considered.Bengal's ruling Trina-mool has already underlined its position, calling for a single-phase election for the State's 42 seats and demanding Central security forces not ""threaten/intimidate voters"".Election Commissioners Case In Supreme CourtThe ECI's pre-announcement comes a day after two new Election Commissioners were inducted, after the retirement of Anup Chandra Pandey in February and Arun Goel's surprise resignation last week. Former IAS officers Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu have been named to the panel.The nomination of Mr Kumar and Mr Sandhu was challenged by the Association for Democratic Re- forms, a non-partisan organisation working on elec- toral and political reforms. The ADR, which also petitioned the top Court in the electoral bonds issue, had sought a stay on the two appointments, challenging the decision to exclude Chief Justice DY Chandra-chud from the selection panel.The top Court-which was hearing the petition as the ECI posted its tweet-has refused to stay Mr Kumar and Mr Sandhu's appointment, and said the matter will be heard next on March 21.Under current laws, Election Commissioners are appointed by the President based on the input of a three-member panel chaired by the Prime Minister. The panel also includes a Union Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, which is currently the Congress' Adhir Chowdhury.In March 2023, however, the Supreme Court had said the panel should consist of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice. However, in an addendum seen by many as giving the Government an out, the Court said the order would remain till passage of a law that said otherwise.In December the Government passed a law that establishes a new mechanism-swapping the Chief Justice for a Union Minister-to appoint all, or any one, of the three Election Commissioners. The poll panel is headed by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.NDTV"

New-Delhi-Jan-3The-Free-Movement-Regime-FMR-which-allows-people-residing-close-to-the-India-Myanmar-bord,"New Delhi, Jan 3The Free Movement Regime (FMR), which allows people residing close to the India-Myanmar border to venture 16 km into each other's territory without visa, will be ended soon, a senior Government functionary said on Tuesday.The 1,643-km-long India-Myanmar border, which passes through Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, currently has FMR. It was implemented in 2018 as part of India's Act East Policy.Under the FMR, every member of the hill tribes, who is either a citizen of India or a citizen of Myanmar and who is resident of any area within 16 km on either side of border can cross over on production of a border pass with one year validity and can stay up to two weeks per visit.""We are going to end the FMR along the Indo-Myanmar border soon. We are going to put fencing along the entire border. The fencing will be completed in next four-and-a-half years. Anyone coming through will have to...get a visa,"" the functionary said.The idea is to not only to stop the misuse of FMR, which is used by insurgent groups to carry out attacks on Indian side and flee towards Myanmar, but also put a halt to influx of illegal immigrants, and paralyse drugs and gold smuggling networks.Tendering for an advanced smart fencing system for 300 km of the India-Myanmar border is already in pipeline and the work will be started very soon.It may be mentioned that Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had urged the Centre in September 2023 to end the FMR. The State Government has argued that insurgents use the free movement regime to further their activities.Manipur shares around 390 km of porous border with Myanmar and only about 10 km has been fenced so far. In July last year, the State Government shared data that around 700 illegal immigrants entered the State.Besides, Mizoram has seen an influx of anti-Junta rebels in thousands since the military coup in Myanmar on February 1, 2021. According to Government estimates, several thousand refugees are living in different parts of Mizoram since the coup.Mizoram shares a 510-km-long porous border with Myanmar.The Manipur Chief Minister had also said that several persons from Myanmar tried to enter into his State but returned on seeing the presence of a large number of security personnel. Manipur shares a 398-km border with Myanmar.Arunachal Pradesh shares a 520-km border with Myanmar while Nagaland shares a 215-km border with the country.PTI"

BANGKOK-Dec-12-Myanmar-has-become-the-world-s-largest-source-of-opium-thanks-to-domestic-instability-and-a,"BANGKOK, Dec 12Myanmar has become the world's largest source of opium, thanks to domestic instability and a decline in cultivation in Afghanistan, the United Nations said in a report on Tuesday.The 95% decline in opium cultivation in Afghanistan after a drug ban by the Taliban in 2022 has seen global supply shifted to Myanmar, where political, social and economic instability brought about by a 2021 coup drove many to poppy farming, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report said.Myanmar farmers now earn about 75% more from opium poppy farming, as average prices of the flower have reached about $355 per kilogram and the cultivation area has increased by 18% year on year, from 40,100 to 47,000 hectares, boosting the potential yield to its highest level since 2001, the UNODC said.""The economic, security and governance disruption that followed the military takeover of February 2021 continue to drive farmers in remote areas towards opium to make a living,"" UNODC Regional Representative Jeremy Douglas said.Opium cultivation areas expanded most in Myanmar's border regions in northern Shan State, followed by Chin and Kachin States, as yield expanded by 16% to 22.9 kilograms per hectare because of more sophisticated farming practices, the UNODC report said.The surge in fighting between the Myanmar military and armed ethnic-minority groups will most likely accelerate the expansion of opium cultivation, Douglas said.The Myanmar junta did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.The expansion of opium cultivation feeds into a growing illicit economy in Myanmar that include high levels of synthetic drug production and trafficking as well as other criminal enterprises from money laundering to online scam centres run by organised crime.Reuters"
New-Delhi-Feb-18The-BJP-s-national-convention-on-Sunday-amended-the-party-s-constitution-allowing-its-apex,"New Delhi, Feb 18The BJP's national convention on Sunday amended the party's constitution, allowing its apex organisational body -- the Parliamentary Board -- to take a decision related to its president, including his or her term and its extension, in ""emergency"" situations.A proposal to this effect was brought by the party's general secretary Sunil Bansal.The party president is generally elected through organisational polls after a few elections are carried out in at least 50 per cent of its state bodies. The state BJP organisation poll is also contingent upon elections in district bodies and so on.Sources said when the party is busy preparing for assembly or Lok Sabha elections, it is hard to follow the laid down practice for the internal polls.Incumbent president J P Nadda is currently on an extended tenure till June 30 in the view of Lok Sabha polls.Though the party has not elaborated on the details and rationale behind the amendment, sources said it may have to do with the future appointments of its presidents.The two-day convention, which ended on Sunday, also saw the passage of three resolutions.Some party leaders indicated that several leaders from different parties, including the Congress, may join it in the next few weeks as the BJP looks to achieve its target of winning 370 seats in the elections to 543-member Lok Sabha.A party leader said MP Nakul Nath, the son of senior Congress leader Kamal Nath, may join the BJP amid intense speculation that the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister may take the plunge himself.He also named some other Congress leaders, including former Union ministers and current MPs, who may switch over in the run up to the elections.The focus will be on strong leaders in places where the BJP may not be very strong, he added.A meeting of chief ministers and deputy chief ministers of the BJP was held following the convention's conclusion and they discussed the details of the party's strategy to win 370 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and governance issues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nadda also attended the meeting.Later in a post on X, Modi said, ""Had an extensive meeting with chief ministers and deputy chief ministers of states where the BJP is serving in government. Discussed ways to further strengthen the growth trajectory of the states so that we can leverage double engine of growth to build a 'Viksit Bharat'.""PTI"

The retaliatory airstrikes intensified the already heated exchange of fire on the Indo-Myanmar border close to Mizoram. Fortunately, there have been no reported damages on the Indian side of the border.Champhai’s Deputy Commissioner, James Lalrinchhana, stated, “Fighting started on Sunday evening and continued through the night. There are also reports of bombing close to the international border, but there’s no damage on the Indian side.”As tensions flare, Mizoram has once again opened its doors to refugees. Over 1000 individuals have sought shelter in Mizoram, with at least 17 persons, including women and children, being treated for injuries sustained during the bombing and gun battle at the District Hospital in Champhai.The Mizoram Government, defying Government of India’s orders to close its border with Myanmar and collect biometrics of the Chin refugees, continues to provide refuge to those fleeing the army crackdown in Myanmar. The State has been a sanctuary for refugees since the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, with Mizoram Minister of Information and Public Relations Lalruatkima stating that around 60,000 refugees from Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh are currently residing in Mizoram. The Government of Mizoram maintains that the Chin people in Myanmar share a common ethnicity with the Mizos.This unfolding situation highlights Mizoram’s defiant stand to support those affected by the ongoing unrest in Myanmar, despite the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions at the border.Chin Resistance routs Myanmar junta in second Indian border town   (The Irrawaddy) : Resistance forces in Chin State have seized a junta base in Reh Khaw Da, Falam Township, a hub for border trade with India, according to the Chin National Front (CNF).Resistance fighters of the CNF’s Chin National Army (CNA), the Chin Defense Force and its Thantlang drone team attacked around 60 soldiers stationed in the camp at 11 pm on Sunday.After inflicting heavy casualties, they finally occupied the camp at 6 am on Monday, CNF spokesperson Salai Htet Ni told The Irrawaddy.“The terrain made it difficult for us, so the fighting was fierce,” he said.A junta fighter jet that attacked during the battle reportedly caused casualties among Chin resistance forces, but details are still unknown.“We took soldiers prisoner and seized both heavy and small weapons,” Salai Htet Ni said.The combined resistance force is now attacking another military base in the same town.The fierce fighting has forced thousands of residents to flee Reh Khaw Da. Some were wounded when the junta shelled a refugee camp in India, according to locals.The Irrawaddy could not independently verify the reports.Salai Htet Ni said the ethnic armed organizations were working with People’s Defense Forces (PDFs) to root out the military dictatorship.They would continue their attacks to further weaken the military, he added.Resistance forces have now seized border towns on both sides of the country after the offensive, known as Operation 1027, was launched by the ethnic Brotherhood Alliance on October 27.The alliance, comprising the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA), has seized dozens of townships in northern Shan State on the border with China.The resistance offensive has also spread to upper Sagaing Region, where the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), AA and PDFs seized the district-level town of Kawlin on November 6. Elsewhere, Karenni resistance forces launched Operation 1107 in support of the offensive, attacking junta bases in Kayah State’s Loikaw and Mese and southern Shan’s Moebye town.Last Tuesday, the trade town of Khampat on the Indian border in Tamu Township was seized in a coordinated attack by the Chin Nationalities Defense Force, KIA and PDFs."
Normal-OPD-OT-to-re-open-soon-at-RIMS-JNIMS-at-SHRI-from-today,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Dec 22: With the COVID-19 graph falling sharply in the State, normal OPD service and surgical operations would be resumed soon at RIMS.The exact date is however yet to be decided.Presently, only emergency cases are treated at the hospital.RIMS Director Prof A Santa told The Sangai Express that normal OPD service as well as normal operations would be resumed within the next two/three days.He said that hospital beds are being cleaned and sanitized.All the wards which are currently used as COVID-19 wards would be transformed as normal wards except the surgery ward.While the surgery ward would be used as COVID-19 for some more time, patients requiring hospitalisation in the surgery ward would be divided among different wards, said the RIMS Director.Normal treatment of psychiatric patients resumed two/three months after flu clinic was separated from the psychiatric ward. Likewise, normal PMR and radio therapy treatments have resumed, he said.As there is an instruction to reserve around 200 beds for COVID-19 patients, arrangements to keep aside these beds have been occupying a lot of space, Prof Santa said.“Earlier, we were thinking about resuming normal OPD service and normal operations only after arrival of COVID vaccine but we would not wait for COVID vaccine”, he said.A database of around 3500 doctors, staff and students of RIMS has been prepared and sent to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for COVID vaccination in the first phase, he said.OPD service and the Operation Theatres will also open from the second week of January at JNIMS, said sources.Shija Hospitals too has notified that routine OPD for all walk-in patients will resume from December 23.Prior appointment through Shija Helpline will no longer be needed for new as well as follow up OPD consultations. Further Covid test will not be made compulsory for walk-in OPD patients.  However, patients and patient parties must follow the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Covid-19 issued by the Directorate of Health Services."
Brussels-Feb-12The-world-just-experienced-its-hottest-January-on-record-continuing-a-run-of-exceptional-he,"Brussels, Feb 12The world just experienced its hottest January on record, continuing a run of exceptional heat fuelled by climate change, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday. Last month surpassed the previous warmest January, which occurred in 2020, in C3S's records going back to 1950.The exceptional month came after 2023 ranked as the planet's hottest year in global records going back to 1850, as human-caused climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, pushed temperatures higher.Every month since June has been the world's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years.""Not only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5 C (1.7 F) above the pre-industrial reference period,"" C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said.""Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing,"" she said.US scientists have said 2024 has a one-in-three chance of being even hotter than last year, and a 99% chance of ranking in the top five warmest years.The El Nino phenomenon began to weaken last month, and scientists have indicated it could shift to the cooler La Nina counterpart later this year. Still, average global sea surface temperatures last month were the highest for any January on record.Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent global warming surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid it unleashing more severe and irreversible consequences.Despite exceeding 1.5 C in a 12-month period, the world has not yet breached the Paris Agreement target, which refers to an average global temperature over decades.Some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, but have urged governments to act faster to cut CO2 emissions to limit overshooting the target - and the deadly heat, drought and rising seas that this would inflict on people and ecosystems - as much as possible.

Yangon-Jan-16An-armed-ethnic-minority-group-in-Myanmar-has-said-it-captured-a-town-and-several-junta-outpos,"Yangon, Jan 16An armed ethnic minority group in Myanmar has said it captured a town and several junta outposts near the border with Bangladesh and India, in the latest setback for the embattled military.Clashes have rocked Myanmar's western Rakhine and Chin states since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked security forces in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since the junta's 2021 coup.The Arakan Army is one of a dozen armed ethnic minority groups in Myanmar's border regions, many of whom have battled the military since independence from Britain in 1948 over autonomy and control of lucrative resources.The group said late Sunday that Arakan Army fighters had seized the town of Paletwa in Chin state, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Bangladesh border.Paletwa sits on the Kaladan river, which a New Delhi-backed infrastructure initiative hopes to use to link India's landlocked northeast to the Bay of Bengal.The Arakan Army posted pictures it said showed its fighters outside the town's police station and general administration office.It said it was now in control of all of Paletwa township, which had a population of over 64,000 people according to the 2014 census.The Arakan Army also said it had captured six military bases along the border with India's Mizoram state.AFP could not confirm the reports.In October an alliance of the Arakan Army and two other ethnic minority groups launched a joint offensive across Myanmar's northern Shan state, capturing towns and seizing vital trade hubs on the China border.Last week the alliance announced a China-mediated ceasefire in Shan after months of conflict that posed the biggest threat to the junta since it seized power.Agence France-Presse"
SANTIAGO-Feb-3At-least-19-people-have-died-in-forest-fires-raging-near-Chile-s-coast-Interior-Minister-Car,"SANTIAGO, Feb 3At least 19 people have died in forest fires raging near Chile’s coast, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said Saturday, warning the toll was likely to climb higher.Fifteen of the 19 victims “have already been identified,” Toha said Saturday morning, adding that there were 92 active fires, with 43,000 hectares (106,000 acres) burned across the country.Earlier, officials had feared that the wildfires claimed around 10 lives and are threatening hundreds of homes, prompting the president to declare a state of emergency.About a dozen fires have been raging since Friday.The blazes are concentrated in the Vina del Mar and Valparaiso tourist regions, where they have ravaged thousands of hectares of forest, cloaked coastal cities in a dense fog of gray smoke and forced people to flee their homes.Authorities declared a curfew for Saturday morning in the two regions until noon (1500 GMT) to facilitate the movement of evacuees and emergency responders.“We have preliminary information that several people have died, around 10,” said Sofia Gonzales Cortes, state representative for the central region of Valparaiso.In the towns of Estrella and Navidad, southwest of the capital, the fires have burned nearly 30 homes, and forced evacuations near the surfing resort of Pichilemu.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” 63-year-old Yvonne Guzman told AFP. When the flames started to close in on her home in Quilpue, she fled with her elderly mother, only to find themselves trapped in traffic for hours.“It’s very distressing, because we’ve evacuated the house but we can’t move forward. There are all these people trying to get out and who can’t move,” she said.On Friday, Chilean President Gabriel Boric decreed “a state of emergency due to catastrophe, in order to have all the necessary resources” to fight the fires.“All forces are deployed in the fight against the forest fires,” he said in a message posted to social media platform X.Emergency services were set to meet Saturday morning to assess the situation.Around 7,000 hectares have already been burned in Valparaiso alone, according to CONAF, the Chilean national forest authority, which called the blazes “extreme.”Images filmed by trapped motorists have gone viral online, showing mountains in flames at the end of the famous “Route 68”, a road used by thousands of tourists to get to the Pacific coast beaches.On Friday, authorities closed the road, which links Valparaiso to the capital Santiago, as a huge mushroom cloud of smoke “reduced visibility”.The fires are being driven by a summer heatwave and drought affecting the southern part of South America caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, as scientists warn that a warming planet has increased the risk of natural disasters such as intense heat and fires.As Chile and Colombia battle rising temperatures, the heatwave is also threatening to sweep over Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil in the coming days.

Sir-I-am-writing-this-letter-to-highlight-a-critical-concern-that-holds-immense-significance-for-the-educati,"Sir,I am writing this letter to highlight a critical concern that holds immense significance for the educational progress of our State, Manipur. Despite the recent turbulent times caused by outbreaks of violence and subsequent mobile internet ban imposed by the State Govt, the digital divide persists as a prominent barrier, especially for college students in the hills of Manipur. While residents in the valley have access to the internet through broadband connections, those in the hills are deprived of this essential resource due to inadequate infrastructure.Access to the internet has become an essential component of modern education. It opens up a world of knowledge, resources, and oppor- tunities that are crucial for the holistic development of students. Unfortunately, many colleges in the hills of Manipur are still deprived of this fundamental tool.The internet ban has hampered the academic pro-gress of students and limits their exposure to the latest educational materials, on-line courses, and research resources. It also restricts their ability to communicate effectively, collaborate on projects, and participate in the global exchange of ideas.In today's interconnected world, providing internet connectivity to these colleges is not just a matter of convenience, but a matter of equity and inclusivity. It is a step towards ensuring that every student, regardless of their geographical location, has an equal chance to succeed and contribute to the progress of our society.I urge the Government of Manipur to prioritize the installation of reliable and high-speed internet connections to some of the re- nowned colleges of Sena-pati, Manipur like Don Bosco College, Maram, Asufii College, Mao and Mount Everest, Senapati, etc. This endeavour by the State Govt will not only enhance the educational experience for students but also alleviate the Govt's challenges in addressing the economic blockade called by the Senapati District Students’ Association (SDSA).Let us work together to bridge our Manipur and create a more inclusive, empowered, and digitally literate Manipur.Thank youYours sincerely,Abina Ng"

The-Suspension-of-Operation-pact-has-indeed-come-a-long-way-First-inked-between-the-Centre-and-the-Kuki-milit,"The Suspension of Operation pact has indeed come a long way. First inked between the Centre and the Kuki militant groups in 2005, it was only later in 2008 that a somewhat reluctant Congress led Government at Imphal came on board and since then it has been an exercise of reviewing the pact by the last day of February  every year and extending it for another year. What progress the supposedly peace process has made can only be known to New Delhi, the SoO outfits and maybe to a certain extent Imphal. What however is clear is the point that no one seems to know why the SoO pact was signed in the first place, given that the SoO outfits were not exactly at ‘war’ with the Government of India. How does one ink a peace pact with an entity which has never raised the voice of revolt ? This is where numerous theories have been doing the round and which have gained more currency after Manipur went  up in flames on May 3, 2023, after the now infamous Tribal Solidarity March organised by the All Tribal Students’ Union, Manipur. Hours before Manipur, save for the Naga dominated districts, was completely engulfed in flames, one could see gun toting elements marching towards Torbung, obviously as participants of the solidarity march, before the said place was systematically attacked, the inhabitants driven out and the houses set on fire. The process of identifying houses belonging to Meitei people, picking them out, setting the houses on fire and levelling them flat to the ground at Churachandpur town followed not long after Torbung went up in flames and common sense says that the acts of arson and destruction could not have been carried out sans the backing of the armed cadres belonging to the SoO outfits. Imphal and the other valley districts retaliated only late in the evening and this was on May 3, 2023 and fast forward to October 31 of 2023 and the sniper rifle that was fired and which killed the Sub-Divisional Police Officer of Moreh Police, Chingtham Anand Kumar could not have been fired by a novice in the use of fire arms and it had all the writings of a trained man pulling the trigger. No village volunteers would have had the expertise nor the guts to engage with fully armed security personnel, belonging to both the State armed forces and Central forces, in a fire fight and what happened at Moreh for days after the assassination of the said police officer and the arrests of some suspects, should testify this line of reasoning.It was in line with this reality that the Manipur Legislative Assembly unanimously resolved to approach the Centre to abrogate the SoO pact. This was on February 29, 2024 and earlier the State Government during a Cabinet meeting on March 10, 2023 had suspended the pact with two outfits of the SoO outfits, the Kuki National Army and the Zomi Revolutionary Army. That this did not impact on the actual status of the pact is clear to all, but Imphal did convey a strong message that it was not ready to take things lying down in the face of rampant encroachment on Protected Forests and the large scale protests that were mobilised against the eviction drives of the Government. The hands of some powerful and influential entity was obvious and it is this which has prompted many organisations to raise the ‘abrogate SoO’ call and the connect between immigrants and SoO outfits cannot be ruled out. This is something which New Delhi must have noted, for it was no one less than Union Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who have raised the flag of mass scale immigration from across the border as one of the reasons for the ongoing clash between the Meiteis and the Kukis. Again one should also take note of the decision of the Centre to suspend the Free Movement Regime and to fence the entire length of the Indo-Myanmar border. This much is clear but what has added another dimension to the SoO pact is the cloud of uncertainty, given that there has been no formal announcement on its extension, even though February 29 has come and gone. For the past 15 years the SoO pact has been extended by one year on the last day of February, but a deafening silence has marked the last day of February this year. The coming Parliamentary elections may be cited as one reason for no formal announcement being made so far, but remember three general elections have been held in 2009, 2014 and 2019 after the SoO pact was signed in 2008. Why the silence now and also important to note that it was Chief Minister N Biren who announced on the floor of the Assembly on March 5 that the involvement of SoO cadres in the ongoing violence is certain. And hereby hangs a tale."

COCOMI-gears-up-for-special-status-campaign,"By Our Staff ReporterIMPHAL, Dec 22: The Coordination Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) has declared that it would launch a mass civil movement demanding the Government of India to grant special status to Manipur.Speaking to media persons at the Lamphelpat office of UCM today, COCOMI coordinator Sunil Karam pointed out that many communities have been living together in Manipur since ages.However, some communities have been repeatedly challenging the integrity of Manipur in pursuit of their ethno-centric and diverse political aspirations, Sunil said.COCOMI has been exploring exhaustively for a viable means to achieve the common goal of peaceful co-existence, collective development and uniform sharing of rights and opportunities by all the communities instead of pursuing and promoting ethno-centric and communal agendas, and the committee decided on demanding special status for Manipur to achieve the same goal, Sunil Karam said.To kick-start the campaign, a people’s convention on special status for Manipur would be held at the City Convention Centre at 11 am on December 26, he said.He then appealed to all community leaders, academicians, intellectuals, CSO leaders, journalists, senior citizens and legal experts to participate and share their views and opinions at the convention.To a query regarding the connotation of the special status, COCOMI assistant coordinator Longjam Ratankumar said that special status broadly refers to political autonomy but the exact definition has not been worked out yet.When one talks about special status, historical, cultural and social aspects will definitely come in the picture.“Even though we broadly refer special status to political autonomy, its building blocks and structural elements would be determined based on the views and ideas shared by experts and the public”, Ratankumar said.COCOMI is organising a people’s convention on December 26 to give a definite shape to the term ‘special status’, he said.The special status as envisaged by the COCOMI encompasses all communities of Manipur and it is aimed at securing a collective and dignified future for the whole State, Ratankumar said.To another query, Sunil Karam said that they would meet the Union Home Minister if they are invited and resolutions adopted at the December 26 people’s convention would be placed before the Union Home Minister.Notably, it has been already reported that Union Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to visit the State on December"

Laithangbam-Kumarsanu-SinghContd-from-previous-issueOn-the-other-hand-China-s-ambitious-Belt-and-Road-Ini,"Laithangbam Kumarsanu SinghContd from previous issueOn the other hand, China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers immense opportunities for economic development and connectivity, particularly in regions historically underserved by infrastructure investments. By financing and constructing critical infrastructure projects, China positions itself as a key partner in driving economic growth and development in recipient countries. This economic leverage not only enhances China’s geopolitical influence but also facilitates the expansion of its trade networks and access to vital resources.Furthermore, China’s emphasis on cultural diplomacy and exchange programs, exemplified by initiatives like Confucius Institutes and language education programs, serves to deepen cultural ties and enhance mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world. Through the promotion of Chinese language, arts, and traditions, China seeks to foster a global community with shared values and aspirations, thereby bolstering its soft power and influence.However, China’s soft power ambitions are not without challenges and controversies. Critics argue that China’s authoritarian political system and censorship practices undermine the authenticity and credibility of its soft power efforts, tarnishing its image and eroding trust in its intentions.Moreover, concerns over the environmental and social impact of BRI projects, as well as allegations of debt traps and neo-colonialism, have fueled skepticism and resistance among some recipient countries and international observers.Additionally, China’s assertive approach to soft power projection has fueled competition and rivalry with other global powers, particularly the United States. Some countries may seek to balance their relationships between the US and China by participating in BRI projects. This could complicate US efforts to rally allies and partners in pursuit of a common geopolitical goal.ConclusionThe Silk Road of influence woven by China’s soft power initiatives encapsulates both the promise of economic prosperity and the menace of geopolitical competition.As China expands its global footprint through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and cultural diplomacy programs, it emerges as a formidable player in shaping the form of the 21st-century world order. However, the path to Chinese soft power supremacy is fraught with challenges and complexities.While the BRI presents unprecedented opportunities for economic development and connectivity, it also raises concerns about debt sustainability, environmental degradation, and social disruption in recipient countries. Similarly, China’s cultural diplomacy efforts face scrutiny over issues of authenticity, censorship, and ideological coercion, undermining their effectiveness in fostering genuine cultural exchange and understanding.Moreover, China’s assertive approach to soft power projection has fueled competition and rivalry with other global powers, leading to heightened geopolitical tensions and strategic manoeuvring. As China vies for dominance along the Silk Road, it encounters resistance and pushback from rival powers and sceptical recipient countries, underscoring the inherent complexities of soft power dynamics in a multipolar world.In navigating these challenges, China must strike a delicate balance between assertiveness and cooperation, addressing legitimate concerns while leveraging its economic and cultural strengths to build bridges and foster mutual understanding. Ultimately, the Silk Road of influence offers both opportunities and pitfalls for China’s soft power ambitions, shaping the trajectory of global governance and cultural exchange in the 21st century."
