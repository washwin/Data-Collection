real-life-in-the-clutches-of-reels,"Reels are a world of their own. It has become such a problem that it has become difficult to get out of its whirlpool even if one wants to. Today there is no topic left on which reels are not being made. It is surprising that reels are being made even to cure the addiction of reels. According to one figure, about 253 crore people watch reels daily. In India, most reels are made for Instagram.With 327 million users, Instagram in India has become the world’s largest reels market. Whereas America comes second. According to a research, 61 percent of the country’s population uses internet media. This figure is expected to increase to 67 percent in the year 2025. According to a study by Kalaari Capital, there are 80 million professional content creators in India. The report of RedSeer study shows that smartphone users in the country use mobile phones for entertainment on an average for two and a half hours. In which more than 40 minutes is spent watching reels. In this also the largest number is of the young generation sometimes for her own entertainment and sometimes in the name of studies, she remains lost in the world of reels.The craze for reels has increased to such an extent that even small children have fallen prey to it and have sacrificed their hunger, thirst, happiness and peace. Due to less outdoor activity of small children, mental health is also being adversely affected. If the situation continues to be like this, the day is not far when, like drug de-addiction centres, Internet media de-addiction centers will start opening in the country to get rid of the addiction of internet media. Cases of unwanted deaths due to reels are also increasing day by day.Are increasing. Most of them are school-college going youth. In order to make their reels look attractive, many times they get hit by a moving train. There is a lot of obscenity on Instagram. Which is having a very bad impact on the society. Not only this, accidents are increasing day by day due to the construction of reels on Delhi’s Signature Bridge.These youth do not hesitate to put their own lives as well as those of other people at risk. Recently in Pali, Rajasthan, a young man was given a reel by his parents.When he was stopped from making it, he got angry and killed his parents. This incident forces every parent to think how to stop this problem? The urgency of the times says that before this digital disease becomes an epidemic, we will have to collectively find a way to get rid of it.( Vijay Garg is a Retired Principal and Educational Columnist from Malout Punjab) "
benefits-of-mango-leaves,"Mango, the fruit we all love, is rightly called the King of fruits. Many people are familiar with the sweet, tropical fruit that comes from mango trees, but you may not realize that the leaves of mango trees are edible as well. But, do you know, even its leaves are full of health benefits? This may feel strange to you, might not go well with many of us, but once you will read about the Mango leaves benefits, you will not just wait for the mango tree in your backyard to give you the sweet mangoes, but will use its leaves as well! Rich in medicinal properties, mango leaves are there all around the year hanging on the mango trees, unlike the fruit, so you won’t have trouble sourcing them. These reddish leaves with a purple tint are a power bank of super nutrients that you would hardly ever imagine. They are rich in flavonoids, and compounds called phenols, Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Tannins & Antioxidants. Cultivated for thousands of years, these leaves are believed to have been brought to Southeast Asia by the Buddhist monks, and ever since, people have been relying on the powerful uses of these leaves. Let us dig deeper and understand the various health benefits of mango leaves and learn about the different uses of mango leaves. Young green mango leaves are very tender, so they’re cooked and eaten in some cultures. Because the leaves are considered very nutritious, they’re also used to make tea and supplements. The leaves of Mangifera indica, a particular species of mango, have been used in healing practices like Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Although the stem, bark, leaves, roots, and fruit are likewise used in traditional medicine, the leaves in particular are believed to help treat diabetes and other health conditions.Mango leaves contain several beneficial plant compounds, including polyphenols and terpenoids. Terpenoids are important for optimal vision and immune health. They’re also antioxidants, which protect your cells from harmful molecules called free radicals. Meanwhile, polyphenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some research suggests that they improve gut bacteria and help treat or prevent conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Mangiferin, a polyphenol found in many plants but in especially high amounts in mango and mango leaves, is credited with numerous benefits. Studies have investigated it as an anti-microbial agent and potential treatment for tumors, diabetes, heart disease, and fat digestion abnormalities.Here are the emerging benefits and uses of mango leaves, backed by science.May have anti-inflammatory properties: Many of the potential benefits of mango leaves result from mangiferin’s anti-inflammatory properties. While inflammation is part of your body’s normal immune response, chronic inflammation can increase your risk of various diseases. Animal studies suggest that mango leaves’ anti-inflammatory properties may even protect your brain from conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. In one study, mango leaf extract given to rats at 2.3 mg per pound of body weight (5 mg per kg) helped counteract artificially induced oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers in the brain.May protect against fat gain: Mango leaf extract may help manage obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome by interfering with fat metabolism Multiple animal studies have found that mango leaf extract inhibits fat accumulation in tissue cells. Another study in mice shows that cells treated with a mango leaf extract had lower levels of fat deposits and higher levels of adiponectin. Adiponectin is a cell signaling protein that plays a role in fat metabolism and sugar regulation in your body. Higher levels may protect against obesity  and obesity-related chronic diseases In a study in rats with obesity, those fed mango leaf tea in addition to a high fat diet gained less abdominal fat than those given only the high fat diet. In a 12-week study in 97 adults with excess weight, those given 150 mg of mangiferin daily had lower fat levels in their blood and scored significantly better on an insulin resistance index than did those given a placebo.May help combat diabetes: Mango leaf may help manage diabetes due to its effects on fat metabolism. Elevated triglycerides levels are often associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes .One study gave mango leaf extract to mice. After 2 weeks, they showed significantly lower triglyceride and blood sugar levels A study in rats found that administering 45 mg per pound of body weight (100 mg per kg) of mango leaf extract reduced hyperlipidemia, a condition marked by unusually high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol In a study that compared mango leaf extract and the oral diabetes drug glibenclamide in rats with diabetes, those given the extract had significantly lower blood sugar levels than the glibenclamide group after 2 weeks.May have anticancer properties: Multiple reviews demonstrate that the mangiferin in mango leaves may have anticancer potential, as it combats oxidative stress and fights inflammation. Test-tube studies suggest specific effects against leukemia and lung, brain, breast, cervix, and prostate cancers. What’s more, mango bark exhibits strong anticancer potential due to its lignans, which are another type of polyphenol. Keep in mind that these results are preliminary and that mango leaves should not be considered a cancer treatment.May treat stomach ulcers: Mango leaf and other parts of the plant have historically been used to aid stomach ulcers and other digestive conditions. A study in rodents found that orally administering mango leaf extract at 113–454 mg per pound (250–1,000 mg per kg) of body weight decreased the number of stomach lesions. Another rodent study found similar results, with mangiferin significantly improving digestive damage.May support healthy skin: Mango leaf extract may reduce signs of skin aging due to its antioxidant content. In a study in mice, mango extract given orally at 45 mg per pound (100 mg per kg) of body weight increased collagen production and significantly shortened the length of skin wrinkles. Keep in mind that this extract was a general mango extract, not one specific to mango leaves. Meanwhile, a test-tube study determined that mango leaf extract may have antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can cause staph infection. Mangiferin has also been studied for psoriasis, a skin condition that causes itchy, dry patches. A test-tube study using human skin confirmed that this polyphenol encouraged wound healing.May benefit your hair: Mango leaves are said to promote hair growth, and mango leaf extract may be used in some hair products. Yet, there’s little scientific evidence to support these claims. Still, mango leaves are rich in antioxidants, which may protect your hair follicles from damage. In turn, this may aid hair growth.Treats Gall and Kidney Stones: The topmost benefit of mango leaves is that it helps to treat gall bladder and kidney stones. If these leaves are consumed in a powdered form daily, it can help break the toughest of gall bladder and kidney stones within no time.Lower Down Blood Pressure: Second major health benefit of using a mango leaves is to control the blood pressure issue. People suffering from high blood pressure can rely on the power of mango leaves to lower their blood pressure and hypertension significantly. Some properties found in these leaves help to strengthen the blood vessels and even treat varicose veins.Cures Restlessness and Anxiety :Those searching for various health benefits of mango  leaves must also note that these leaves have the power to treat anxiety and restlessness too. Mangiferin, a phytochemical found in these leaves, is known to possess anti-anxiety properties.Now that you have gained sufficient knowledge about the various surprising uses of mango leaves, it is obvious for you to be curious to know how to use these miraculous leaves? One of the best ways to consume mango leaves to reap all of the above-mentioned health benefits is by using it in a tea form. For this, just boil 10-12 mango leaves in about 150 mL of water or use mango leaf tea bags, and you are done! You can also make a powder of mango leaves by cleaning, drying, and then grinding them in a mixer. Store this powder in an air-tight container to help it last longer. You may also choose to get the powder of mango leaves from ayurvedic clinics. Some people also make a paste of clean freshly sourced mango leaves to apply it as a hair mask. Isn’t it amazing that mango, the fruit in itself is not wonderful, even its leaves are beneficial for mankind? Available all around the year, mango leaves are also known as Mangifera Indica in botanical terms and have been appreciated for their medicinal values in Ayurveda for centuries, but the common man has just now started realizing its various health benefits. The easiest way to use it is by making herbal tea or using it in a powder form, the benefits in some time will astonish you for sure, so do try it! It is important to note that using mango leaves in powdered form or making its tea is a natural home remedy that works well for most people. However, if you see any allergic reactions or see any adverse changes in your health, you must consult a doctor.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "

changing-scenario-of-meitei-wedding,"A traditional Meitei wedding, deeply rooted in heritage and customs, is an elaborate affair that unites families and communities in joyous celebration. In every society, whether primitive or civilized, marriage in much aspect is the most important social institution. Marriage is a socio-religious institution. It is a social contract for the satisfaction of physical, biological, psychological and spiritual needs of Man and woman leading to the formation of a family. Thus the growth and development as well as the stability of human society depend upon this universal and primary institution. On account of this vital importance, the sanctity and permanence of marriage has been emphasized in most societies and the Meitei Society is not an exception in this regard. The Meitei concept of marriage implies the sacred and ceremonial union of a man and a woman with due religious rites. The vernacular term for marriage is “Luhongba” which is a combination of two words, “Lu” which means “head” in archaic Manipuri and “Hongba” to solemnize. Hence Luhongba is the ceremonial union of the “Lu” of the man and the woman implying the oneness of their heart and soul rather than the state of their being double.In the long journey of life the Meiteis believed that woman is called oigilamdang (left way) and man Yet Ki lamdang (rightway). Thus Meitei marriage is primarily conceived as lifelong physical and spiritual companionship between the wife and the husband. The Meiteis are generally exogamous but endogamy was found in the early times. Actually this endogamous system is prohibited in Meitei society but the practice is prevalent among the members of the hill tribes. In Meitei society both in early and present days there are certain taboos and rules connected with the institution of marriage. If anybody breaking the rules was expelled from the common society.In Meitei society, the boys are given the right to make a free choice of their own mate. The parents of the groom go to the house of the bride and ask for her hand. It is called ‘Nupi Haiba’. After that a date is fixed for the marriage. Before one or two days of marriage, a ceremony called ‘Heijingpot’ is performed. Before one day of marriage, there is small ceremony called ‘Bor Baton Touba’. It is a ceremony of inviting the groom for the marriage. In this day, a boy of tender age with the elderly person goes the groom’s house and invites him for marriage. On the day of marriage, the groom wears a white turban, white shirt and dhoti. Marriage ritual is performed on the bride’s family. In Meitei society, the above order follows strictly. After that the groom follows with their friends. And the invites follows. At the gate of the bride, the groom is welcomed with the bonfire known as ‘Mei okpa’. This is done to dispel the evil spirit from the groom. Puffed rice is also sprayed along the fire. After entering the house the groom is again welcomed by three ladies led by groom’s mother. The ‘Kujapot’ from the hand of bride and groom is removed. Then the bride stands up from her sit and moves around the groom for seven time. She is also showered flower on the groom. This is called ‘Lei Chaiba’. After that the bride put two garland of ‘Kundo’ (a kind of flower) on the neck of the bride. Then the groom again takes out one garland from his neck and put on the neck of the bride. After this the ritual end .The bride and groom become husband and wife. On the sixth day of marriage a great grand feast called ‘Chak Kouba’ is performed in the bride’s place.Social change is a natural phenomenon. New conditions emerge and to meet new challenges a society adopts, adjust and change. After 70 years of independence, we cannot expect Indian society to remain static and completely traditional. Among the institutions that have shaped human civilization, marriage and family occupies a vital position. These together not only form the cradle of our future society, but also the hub of social life for the people. Like other institutions of the society, marriage also has been undergoing a gradual transformation and adjustment in different situations and epochs of history. Later on the advent of Western education, the process of urbanization, modernization and industrialization accelerated these changes. The rural and normative guidelines regulating marriage are also bound to change to meet new demands and expectations. Simultaneously many factors- legalistic, political, socio-economic and cultural also have cumulative impact upon the institution of marriage of urban family.Since elders had a big say, money took preponderance over everything else. Property of the girl’s father, and gifts to be given to the extended family, mattered a lot. The size of the marriage procession became a matter of serious discussion, being related to the prestige of both sides.In Meitei society, now a days huge expenses are being made for unnecessary things like Phijang Khanba (decorating all around spending lakhs of rupees), Cake cutting during heijingpot, which was not practiced traditionally, bhabok mamang sel thaba apart from pala sel thaba, huge number of vehicles during marriage day and a new dimension of Photo session gallery as well as Photo session on Chakouba day etc. Thus everything that hardly mattered to the young couple was so important.   In the end, the girl’s as well as boy’s families have to cough out a formidable amount, just to be wasted away on unnecessary expenses, which have no relevance for the actual marriage, per se. The lofty ideal of simple marriage has evaporated into thin air.Indian society has been facing a crisis of family relations in recent times. The problems did exist earlier too. However, the changes in the rules and laws related to family affairs have now precipitated problems and exposed the dormant fissures. Slowly the situation has gone out of control and the girl’s father many times has to worry about payments of loans after his daughter’s marriage.  People try to give those gifts in their daughter’s marriage, which they might have never seen in their life. Although the rules were framed to curb the menace, people soon learned to circumvent the same. When the girl’s father visits the would-be groom’s family for discussions, he is often treated with contempt. According to Hindu orthodox customs, he was not supposed to take even water from the groom’s house. The talks would sometimes go on to the extent of humiliation and proposals turned down for money.Sometimes the bride’s father would play smart and approach the police to file an FIR about the rejection of the proposal due to the demand for money. Such episodes have cast a very bad impression on the psyche of the girls. A few rejections of the proposals tend to make girls become very negative and even parents subsequently hesitate even to talk of any fresh proposal.This scene is very often shown in Manipuri films.Traditional marriage is now considered as a loss of individuality, loss of privacy, lack of freedom, lack of individual growth, lack of social and sexual variety, dissatisfaction with spouse, sexual frustration, problem with in-laws etc. All these factors have led to a change in the form and purposes of marriage. At present the new trend of live-in-relationship is emerging in urban Indian society. Live-in-relationship or cohabitation is an arrangement where two people, who are not married, live together in an intimate relationship, particularly an emotionally or sexually intimate one, on a long term or permanent basis. Today individuals have become career oriented. Women are going out for work. This is preventing them to go into the bonds of married life that is full of responsibility. Economic independence of people in urban society also paves way to live-in relations as these people don’t want interference in their personal life. These days’ young men and women are getting opportunity to know and spend time with each other. This enhances the chances of getting into live-in relationship. Many people believe that live-in relationship is a good way to test their relationship before marriage. Besides there are many other alternative forms of marriages are emerging as-35 the intrinsic marriage, utilitarian marriage, open marriage, two step marriage/multi step marriage, temporary marriage, group marriage, consensual marriage, covenant marriage, commuter marriage, swinging and sexually open marriage. If an analysis is made of need of such relationship, avoiding responsibility would emerge as the prime reason. The lack of commitment, the disrespect for social bonds and the zero tolerance power in relationship have given rise to find these various alternatives to marriage. The processes of educational and urban development have, no doubt, created new situations and problems and have upset certain traditional mores and values. Yet the marriage institution continues to be the core of Indian society and has not experienced a general disintegration.Writer can be reached at:[email protected] "
international-mother-language-day,"International Mother Language DayBy: Sanjenbam Jugeshwor SinghInternational Mother Language Day is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and to promote multilingualism. This day is also recognized as Matribhasha Diwas. The theme for International Mother Language Day 2024 is “To set goals for preserving endangered languages, promoting multilingualism, and sustaining linguistic heritage”. First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262 in 2002. Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative “to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world” as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, which also established 2008 as the International Year of Languages. The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, 21 February (1952) is the anniversary of the day when the Bengalis i.e. Pakistani Bengali Muslims (now Bangladeshi Bengali Muslims) of the Pakistani province of East Bengal (now independent state of Bangladesh) fought for recognition of their Bengali language. It is also observed by the Indian Bengalis of the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Tripura and Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.21 February was declared to be International Mother Language Day by UNESCO on 17th November, 1999. It has been observed throughout the world since 21 February 2000. The declaration came up in tribute to the Language Movement done by the Bangladeshis (then the East Pakistan).When Pakistan was created in 1947; it had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). The two parts were very different from each other in the sense of culture and language, and were also separated by India in between. In 1948, the Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan, even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan and West Pakistan. The East Pakistan people protested since the majority of the population was from East Pakistan and their mother language was Bangla. They demanded Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu. The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan.To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings. On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed. Abdul Jabbar and Shafiur Rahman died, with hundreds of others injured. This was a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue. Since then, Bangladeshis celebrate the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days. They visit the Shaheed Minar, a monument built in memory of the martyrs and its replicas to express their deep sorrow, respect and gratitude to them.International Mother Language Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh. The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, Bengalis living in Vancouver, Canada. They wrote a letter to Kofi Annan on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world’s languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement. Languages are the most powerful instruments of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage. All moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue.Rafiqul Islam’s proposal was introduced in the Bangladesh Parliament and in due course (at the behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) a formal proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Government of Bangladesh. The process of shepherding the proposal through UNESCO’s regulatory system was undertaken by Syed Muazzem Ali, then Bangladesh ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to UNESCO, and Tozammel Tony Huq, his predecessor, who was then a Special Adviser to UNESCO Secretary General Federico Mayor. Finally on 17 November 1999, the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously resolved that “21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952.”As knowledge grows, people are coming to understand that languages are critical for growth, ensuring cultural variety, and facilitating international conversation, but they are also important for cooperation and educational quality for everyone. Today there is growing awareness that languages play a vital role in development, in ensuring cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, but also in strengthening co-operation and attaining quality education for all, in building inclusive knowledge societies and preserving cultural heritage, and in mobilizing political will for applying the benefits of science and technology to sustainable development. Languages, with their complex implications for identity, communication, social integration, education and development, are of strategic importance for people and planet. Yet, due to globalization processes, they are increasingly under threat, or disappearing altogether. When languages fade, so does the world’s rich tapestry of cultural diversity. Opportunities, traditions, memory, unique modes of thinking and expression — valuable resources for ensuring a better future — are also lost. Every two weeks a language disappears taking with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage. At least 43% of the estimated 6000 languages spoken in the world are endangered. Only a few hundred languages have genuinely been given a place in education systems and the public domain, and less than a hundred are used in the digital world. Multilingual and multicultural societies exist through their languages, which transmit and preserve traditional knowledge and cultures in a sustainable way. International Mother Language Day is observed every year to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism. It’s a known fact that several countries across the world are multilingual (or at the very least, bilingual), and their languages form their cultural and intellectual heritage. International Mother Language Day is celebrated to promote multilingual education and free expression in the mother tongue. The day encourages everyone to nurture linguistic diversity, and develop awareness of different linguistic traditions across the globe.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
migratory-birds-loktak-lake,"Migratory birds including those from Siberia have started flocking the Loktak Lake and its surrounding smaller lakes and marshy lands. Several migratory birds and a variety of waterfowl have arrived at Loktak Lake. The lake is also the breeding ground of a number of migratory birds. More than 30 rare migratory birds such as brahmani duck/ruddy duck, pochard, red-legged falcon, geese, snipe, shiri, etc. from Siberia, mainland Russia and the Himalayan range visit Loktak, the only fresh water lake in the Northeastern region particularly in the winter months of November, December and January. But, environmentalists are concerned with the sharp reduction in the number of these birds in the last few years. They say that about only 20 types of aquatic birds visited the lake in the last few years. Over-hunting, gradual decrease of the habitat and the climatic changes are the reasons behind the sharp reduction. Birds like ukong, gull, Kanga, red-legged falcon, which were seen in flocks 10 years ago, are no more seen visiting the lake. Gulls numbering around 30 were last seen flocking at the Pumlen Pat a few years back. Butthis bird no longer visits the Pat, environmentalists have observed. Red-legged falcons coming from the lakes in Siberia which flocked at Loktak have now shifted their flocking places at the banks of Barak, Makru and Irang rivers. This bird will remain till December and then shift to the lakes in south India, Sri Lanka, etc. Deforestation, urbanization and use of insecticides, to meet the demands of an expanding population coupled by climate changes has threatened Manipur’s rich biodiversity and rendered certain fish and bird species extinct. Ornithologists conducting a head count of migratory water birds at Manipur’s Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in South Asia, have expressed disappointment over spotting fewer winged guests this time.The census, organised by the Bombay Natural History Society and supported by Manipur’s Environment and Climate Change Department and Loktak Development Authority, covered Loktak and the Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) last week.KLNP, the largest floating park in the world and home to the rare and endangered brow-antlered deer, locally known as Sangai, served as the focal point of the head count. According to state coordinator of Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), the census exercises were conducted at 50 spots across Loktak and Keibul Lamjao and each spot was manned by four ornithologists using telephoto cameras and binocular. Students and researchers also supported the head count. Although the final census report is pending, however the team anticipates the total bird count to be less than 12,000, with a significant drop in species by around 10.This decline is disheartening compared to previous figures, when over 20,000 birds of more than 20 species were spotted, and in some years, even over 30,000 birds were witnessed.However,it is noted that all the resident waterfowl species, such as lesser whistling ducks, coot, pheasant tail jacana, were still observed. The census included certain migratory bird species like coot, ferruginous pochard, gadwall, but Baer’s pochards from Mongolia, seen in previous years at Keibul Lamjao, were notably absent.The team attributed the dwindling figures of migratory water birds at Loktak to factors such as construction of private fish farms along the lake shores disturbing shoreline birds, an increase in the number of fishermen, poaching, and the use of LED bulbs by fishermen at night. Amid Manipur’s battle against protracted ethnic violence, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) and the fishing community that is facing the impact of indiscriminate hunting of waterfowl and the illegal use of the electric shock method for fishing have been urging the public to emerge as responsible guardians of this invaluable natural resource.The lake is not just a source of livelihood, but a goddess to the people of Manipur and a mother to the fishing community. It is the cradle of Manipuri civilisation and culture.Altogether 32,853 wild birds including different species were sighted during this year‘s bird count.Even though this year‘s figure was lower than last and previous years, never-seen species of birds were sighted this year, but more than 34,000 birds were sighted last year. Out of around 60 species of wild birds sighted during the count, Whistling Teal locally known as Tingri was seen the most and altogether 14,000 Tingris were sighted. One area where the maximum number of wild birds flocked together was the northern side of the lake‘s Ningthoukhong sector, the report said pointing out that the number of birds seen this year was lower than previous year because of trapping and hunting of wild birds by some locals. Moreover, common Shelduck (local name Thangong Arangba), Glossy (Ibis Kakshu), Grey Leg Geese (Kanga) and Mandarin Duck (Sana Nganu) were also seen after a gap of many years. Of the thousands of migratory birds that have landed this winter at Loktak Lake, in Manipur in northeast India, the rare sighting of a once-abundant songbird with distinctive bright yellow under parts holds a different meaning for birders.With a push from conservationists and strong participation of local community, especially youth, the state government aimsto ramp up the number of dwindling birds around the shrinking Loktak Lake by setting up this sanctuary in a one square kilometer wetland patch in Thinungei village to the west of Loktak Lake. Nestled in the northeastern state of Manipur, India, Loktak Lake is the largest floating freshwater lake in South Asia. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the Phumdis, or floating islands that dot the lake’s surface. The Phumdis are caused by the lake’s unique geographical and geological features. During the rainy season, the lake covers about 286 square kilometers but reduces to about 40 square kilometers during the dry season. The phumdis, made up of flora, biological materials, and soil, float on the lake’s surface, making it a mosaic of green islands. The floating mass continually shifts and responds to changing seasons and weather conditions. Loktak Lake’s dynamic nature distinguishes it from other lakes and makes it an ecological wonder.Loktak Lake is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The Phumdis are home to various plant species, including grasses, shrubs, and aquatic plants. The endangered sangai deer, commonly known as the dancing deer due to its elegant movements, is found in the Keibul Lamjao National Park, which spans a large chunk of the lake. The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is found nowhere else on the planet. Fishing is an important activity in the Loktak Lake region, supporting many local populations. The lake is filled with fish species, such as Indian major carp, essential to the local economy. Besides its ecological richness, Loktak Lake has enormous cultural value for Manipur’s indigenous inhabitants. It is not just a source of income for them but also a part of their cultural legacy. The lake has been a significant resource for fishing, agriculture, and transportation for generations. The Phumdis are used for farming, and traditional cottages called “Phumshangs” are constructed on them. One of Loktak Lake’s most unique and physically stunning features is the traditional fishing technique called “Phumdi phishing.” Fishermen use cone-shaped nets to catch fish from their small, circular boats. This technique is not only a monument to the local communities’ inventiveness but also an important component of their cultural identity.While Loktak Lake is undeniably a natural wonder that blends stunning beauty with ecological value and cultural significance,it suffers several environmental challenges. Pollution is a significant issue, primarily from agricultural runoff and home sewage. Introducing invasive aquatic organisms like water hyacinth endangers the lake’s fragile ecosystem. To address these issues, conservation activities have been launched. The Keibul Lamjao National Park, which encompasses a large chunk of the lake, has been declared a Ramsar Site and is internationally recognized for its importance as a wetland. Several organizations and government agencies collaborate to safeguard and preserve the lake’s distinct environment. It emphasizes the importance of protecting these delicate ecosystems for future generations by demonstrating the interconnectedness of nature and human life. A visit to Loktak’s Floating Lake is not only an opportunity to observe nature’s wonder but also an opportunity to connect with a way of life that is truly unique and inspiring.Writer can be reached at:[email protected] "
wetland-and-human-wellbeing,"Wetlands provide habitat to a variety of native species of plant and animals as well as thousands of winter migratory birds. They prevent settlements from getting flooded by absorbing excess rainwater and then releasing it slowly during dry seasons or during droughts. They also help sequestrate carbon, which helps mitigate climate change. Wetlands are an important source of water security, act as buffers in extreme events, provide livelihood to people depending on their produce, act as cultural and recreational hubs and help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wetlands provide excellent opportunities for education and research and are good habitats for migratory birds and hot spots of biodiversity. Wetlands are valuable as sources, sinks and transformers of a multitude of biological, chemical and genetic material. In addition, wetlands have special attributes as the cultural heritage of humanity and have deep connections with our beliefs and practices. Wetlands provide several benefits to humanity and, therefore, need to be conserved and used wisely. In spite of all the benefits provided by wetlands, these ecosystems continue to be degraded, polluted, encroached upon and converted for alternate uses. A wetland area trend index constructed by Wetlands International South Asia for Indian wetlands based on 237 published data points for 1980 – 2014 indicates an average decline in natural wetlands area by 30%. The rapid loss of natural wetlands is as much a threat to water and climate security as is an environmental crisis.  The current efforts for wetlands conservation are far short by several orders of the rapid pace of degradation of these ecosystems.The wetlands outside the protected areas are never fenced or demarcated properly leading to encroachments. As per the 2017 rules, district-level wetland authorities for all the 75 districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh are to be made with district magistrate as chairperson. However, mapping and demarcation of all wetlands has not been done yet. Many districts have not even convened the meeting of the district wetland authority. Correctly mapping all the wetlands in the state is a critical step in the wetland restoration process. Till October 2023, as many as 75 wetlands in the country have been categorised as Ramsar sites, out of which 10 are in Uttar Pradesh. The 10 Ramsar sites in Uttar Pradesh provide protection to almost 40,000 ha of water bodies. The 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance is the oldest convention related to protection of water bodies. The convention came into force on December, 21, 1975 and India became signatory to it on February 1, 1982.Wetlands outside the protected areas are being frequently transformed into built-up areas for various development projects, including housing, businesses and road construction. Such activities cause heavy destruction to their existence and the ecosystems they support. There are thousands of wetlands in the districts of Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Lucknow, Barabanki, Sitapur and Baharaich. Hardoi alone has more than 2,000 wetlands. Rae Bareli has lost around 89 per cent of wetlands since 1972. Lucknow lost around 70 per cent of wetlands in the last 50 years. Baghel Taal in Bahraich district, whose perimeter is almost 42 km, is not even declared as wetland, despite being one of the largest wetlands in the state. Its jurisdiction is a subject of confusion between the forest division of Bahraich and Katarniaghat, a nearby protected wildlife sanctuary that encompasses several swamps and wetlands. Many wetlands are divided between revenue departments of two districts, creating conflicts and confusion in their protection. For example, Haiderpur Wetland, which falls under Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, is on the border of Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar districts. But the land does not come under the jurisdiction of the forest department of Ignore. In fact, as reported by the Space application Center, Manipur also has 139 wetlands even though that depends on sizes that more than 2.25 hectares. So out of those we could find and verified only 23 wetlands. But as of now, we cannot say that other wetlands are lost. Now as reported by the State wetland Authority, which is the Nodal Agency, led by the Director of Environment and Climate Change, it has identified 23 wetlands and documented for sustainable management. It is also reported in a Local TV channel that Awang Lamphel Pat at Tangkham Maning, Sawombung Block, Imphal East, which was once a wetland has lost its original & natural status.In the absence of any protection, over-extraction of groundwater for intensive irrigation is causing the demise of many of these wetlands. They are routinely tilled; tractors can be seen ploughing wetlands even in the protected areas.  Due to various anthropogenic threats, including high loads of pollutants from agricultural runoff, industrial waste and sewage, native species of wetlands are being replaced by invasive species. Invasive species have the capacity to outcompete native plants and animals within wetlands. This can lead to a disturbance in the ecosystem, ultimately diminishing the overall health of the wetland. It is important to delineate the boundary of the wetlands correctly; generally pre-monsoon water spread of the wetlands is almost half of the post-monsoon water spread. Therefore, the best time to mark the boundary is post-monsoon which shows the actual spread of the wetlands. The boundary should include all structural components such as marshy area, mudflats and aquatic vegetation. Of the four types of aquatic vegetation found on wetland—floating, emergent, submerged and benthic—only floating and emergent vegetation can be captured by the drone camera or satellite pictures.Celebrated annually on 2 February, World Wetland Day aims to raise global awareness about the vital role of wetlands for people and the planet to mark the day of the adoption of the Ramsar Convention in 1971. The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty for the conservation of wetlands. World Wetland Day has been organised since 1995 to raise awareness of the value of wetlands for nature and society. The theme for World Wetlands Day 2024 is ‘Wetlands and human wellbeing.’ This theme spotlights the interconnectedness wetlands have with human life, with people drawing sustenance, inspiration and resilience from these productive ecosystems. Importantly, this theme underscores how all aspects of human well-being are tied to the health of the world’s wetlands and calls on each of us to value and steward our wetlands. On 30th August 2021, in the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution was adopted proclaiming 2nd February of each year as World Wetland Day. The commemoration raises awareness and increases people’s understanding of the critical importance of wetlands. In every corner of the world, human beings have depended on wetlands for centuries, drawing sustenance, inspiration and resilience from these important environments. This year’s theme: ‘Wetlands and Human Wellbeing’ highlights the linkages between people, culture and nature./  We need healthy wetlands for our planet, and for our wellbeing. Wetlands are currently protected under different designations, including the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. Currently almost 100 UNESCO World Heritage wetlands are overlapping wholly or partially with over 140 Ramsar Sites. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the World Heritage Convention safeguard wetland sites covering an area larger than Mexico (245 614 112 ha).Despite this protection by these global international treaties – wetlands are still an often overlooked asset of our natural environment. The continuous monitoring and preservation of World Heritage wetlands is a monumental task, and it is impossible for UNESCO and the States Parties to do it alone. We are very grateful to combine our efforts with the devotion and expertise of Ramsar and the many other people and organizations we work with, worldwide. The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2010, enacted under the Environment Protection Act of 1986, make it compulsory for the state government to identify, demarcate and officially designate all wetlands across the state within a stipulated period of two years. Further, the state has created a State Wetland Authority after the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2017 shifted the emphasis of wetland management from a central authority to state-level bodies. The State Wetland Authority is responsible for the conservation and management of wetlands in the state. Apart from these, various laws and regulations have been formulated to protect wetlands and their biodiversity, such as the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Yet, wetlands in Uttar Pradesh continue to face multiple threats, primarily from encroachments.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
restoration-of-lamphel-pat-in-its-original-status,"Lamphelpat, which is in the foothills of the Langol hill range, was a natural water reservoir. Siltations, encroachment by private individuals and construction of government installations have turned it into a mere marshy place. The historically significant Lamphelpat is staring at an uncertain future. This wetland in the urban area of Imphal West district is about 19.22 square kilometers and “shrinking”, said experts. Lamphelpat is a mini Loktak lake, maintaining the ecosystem of Imphal city and its surrounding areas. In the past it served as a reservoir, storing excess water of the Luwangli and Nambul rivers during monsoon. It was used to release water to the rivers during the lean season. It is said that Maharaj Bodhchandra Singh’s durbar resolved in the early ’40s to prevent conversion of the water body into an agricultural land.Lamphel in Imphal West is about 60 square kilometers in area and comprises 25.01 sq. km in rural area and 34.99 sq. km in urban area. And for many years, the famous Lamphelpat had been providing its abundant resources and services to the surrounding people. The wetland stores water drained from the Lamphel Reserve Forest and the Nambul River. It brought down the temperature and controlled or mitigated flood by storing the excess water from Nambul River. Residents of Uripok, neighbors to the Lamphelpat, hailed the decision taken by state government. Uripok is a flood-prone neighbourhood.”We suffer floods every year. This time we had five floods due to breaches of the Nambul embankment. Two days’ rain makes the river overflow and rainwater has nowhere to go. Uripok is flooded if rain continues for two days,” a person, who is residing near the Nambul river, said. Other areas of Imphal too experienced flash floods whenever it rains. Now all these have been affected by uncontrolled anthropogenic activities and negligence. However it is confident that once Lamphelpat’s water body is restored, floods can be controlled and water scarcity in an around Imphal city will end.With siltation, human encroachment and dumping of waste materials in the wetland, the Lamphelpat has lost its original glory. Siltation and dumping of waste materials have made it shallower every year and water plants and weeds have wholly covered the wetland suffocating it. “Wetlands offer many benefits or services.  They regulate micro- climate and bring down temperature of the local area. They help mitigate floods and support biodiversity. They are home to many flora and fauna essential to maintaining ecological balance. “On conservation that bringing water back to the wetland only would not help preserve and save it. “A wetland can be said to have been restored and preserved when it resumes all the ecosystem services. It would again support all the flora and fauna and regulate micro-climate.”The densely populated urban area of Imphal or the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is warmer than the rural areas surrounding it. This excess heat is created by energy from all the people, cars, buses and infrastructures. However, the presence of a healthy urban wetland would provide a micro-climate, a local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas. It (wetland) would cool or bring down the temperature in the urban area by absorbing carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Further, if the Lamphelpat is restored and successfully conserved, it would reduce or mitigate flash floods that happen frequently in Imphal area. Human settlement and development can take place vertically without affecting the wetland, that timely and speedy conservation of the wetland would benefit all. Resources mapping may be done to protect and conserve them.According to State Wetland Technical Committee, the Lamphelpat is one among many wetlands the committee recommended to the State Wetland Authority for conservation. The Lamphelpat was also famous for Kombirei flower. Conserving the wetland would not only bring back this flower but also migratory birds. Conserving the wetland would also attract tourists. According to experts the soil profile of the Lamphelpat has revealed that it contains about 20 feet thick layer of soil made of decomposed biomass and soft clay. This soil profile confirms that it was a wetland that the upper soil of the Lamphelpat burns when dried and ignited because it is composed of decomposed biomass. Further, the soil of Lamphelpat is not suitable for major construction and as such there had been discussion to build some of the infrastructure elsewhere. It is also known fact that, there have been frequent floods in the wetland area as the Samusang Uku (culvert-drainage/discharge point) was narrow. During the 2015 flood, about 1131 mm water was drained into the Lamphelpat when discharge capacity at Samusang Uku was about 31.2 cubic meters per second. During the rainy season of 2018, about 1974 mm water was drained into the wetland when the Samusang Uku was able to discharge only about 18.3 cubic meters per second. This made the water level of Lamphelpat rise enormously flooding the surrounding areas.On the other hand, some historian recalled that the Lamphelpat was a source of livelihood for the locals. Locals used to fish in the water and cattle grazed in the wetland. There were no major settlements and infrastructure development in the wetland area till the 1960s. Since the 60s, there have been massive changes in terms of settlement and infrastructure development in the wetland.Now there is Central Agricultural University, Zoo, Games Village, Langol Housing Complex, NIT, Sewage Plan and other Government offices and projects in the wetland area. There are three major roads-Games village road, Shija Hospital road and Central School road, all of which are affecting and disturbing the natural flow of water causing floods. The Lamphelpat used to mitigate floods, now it is causing floods. The wetland should be conserved in time before it is too late, he added.Meanwhile, according to Water Resources Department, development of a 442 square kilometres water body in Lamphelpat area has been started and going on in full-swing. The project with an estimated cost of around Rs. 650 croreis being implemented under the Ministry of Jal Shakti with funding from the World Bank. 80 percent of the cost will be borne by the Centre while the remaining 20 percent will be covered by the State Government.The project aims at improving and enhancing supply of drinking water, flood control and eco-tourism. The planned water body would store excess water from Nambul River and water collected from various sources and catchment areas would be further treated for use in water supply schemes. In fact restoration of Lamphelpat will benefit enormously for the people of Manipur in general and Imphal area in particular. This is a right step forward and let’s hopes it is completed in the stipulated time.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
intellectual-property-challenges-issues,"Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected by law, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.Important IPR are:A Patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how – or whether – the invention can be used by others. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document. Copyright is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps and technical drawings. A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks date back to ancient times when artisans used to put their signature or “mark” on their products. Geographical indications and appellations of origin are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, a reputation or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. An industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an article, or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color. Trade secrets are IP rights on confidential information which may be sold or licensed. The unauthorized acquisition, use or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection.Intellectual property challenges are the threats to the stability of copyright, trademark, patent, and other areas of intellectual property (IP) protection. The balance between the interests and needs of creators and the public is a fundamental underpinning of IP law. When this balance is no longer maintained, respect for Intellectual property protection is in danger. Thirty years ago, IP was a small specialty area of law; today, it is an ever-growing field that supports billion-dollar industries. Despite this increased importance and prevalence, the sanctity of IP protection is threatened by a lack of respect for this area of law. Many individuals believe that: IP infringement doesn’t hurt anyone; if they do infringe on another’s IP, they won’t get caught; IP rights allow the owner to collect inflated profits; IP rights restrict competition. These perceptions indicate that many believe that the balance of IP laws is in favor of the holders of these rights, as illustrated by the ready availability of counterfeit products; pirated movies, music, and software.India joined WTO (World Trade Organization) and became a signatory of the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual rights) agreements in the year of 1995. With this, all the signatories were supposed to align their IP rules in conformation with the TRIPS agreement. However, developing countries like India were granted a window period of 10 years (5-compulsory +5 extended) to comply with the rules put forth by the agreement. Though India had aligned its rule in accordance to TRIPS in the year 2005, still, there are many challenges and issues that need to be addressed to maximize the benefits. Thus getting and granting IP rights in India have become a matter of contention since 2005 and various stakeholders are interested in knowing India address these issues.Though, there are many challenges we will list only the top 6, that are of utmost importance in India, they are:1. From Process to Product Patents- One of the binding point in TRIPS agreement is that all member countries are required to shift their patent regime from “Process Patent” to “Product Patent.” The fundamental difference between a Process Patent regime and a Product Patent regime lies in the fact that the former protects for processes only while the latter products. It becomes a contentious issue when it comes to getting IP rights on pharmaceuticals and food products.2. Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act- Another challenge that it is facing is the condemnation of section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act. This section prevents multinational companies ever greening their patents simply by making minor changes. Implementation of 3(d) was exercised in challenging the patent of Novartis Glevac drug. The Court rules that multinational companies can’t evergreen their patents simply by making minor changes in earlier patents and they need to show considerable “Therapeutic Efficiency” to get patent protection in already existing patents.3#Compulsory licensing- With the provision of compulsory licensing, the Govt. of India can compel the owner company or other companies to mass produce some drugs in emergency irrespective of who got the patent. Multinationals are accusing India of being opportunistic in their stand and are asking to abrogate this provision. However, Indian Govt. is not willing to cancel this provision to safeguard the interests of mass4. Provision of Drug Price Control Order- With this provision companies can’t charge an unfair price for drugs that they are producing. The price has to be justified regarding investments, and if someone plays foul, then the Govt. has the right to intervene.5. Food security and IPR- India is a land of farmers wherein most of the people are engaged in doing farming for their livelihood. In such a country Govt. offers many subsidies to farmers. India’s domestic support schemes are generally in the form of “minimum support price” for major agricultural commodities and “input” subsidies provided to farmers in the types of electricity, fertilizers, seeds, etc. However, for complete implementation of TRIPS agreements, these subsidies will have to be reduced or eliminated. Thus, the Indian Government is struggling to create a balance between food security and providing IP rights in India.6. IPRs, Community property rights, & Indigenous knowledge- Traditional knowledge gives ready-made leads for pharmaceutical companies and then simply come up with the new formulation to show the efficacy of the general traditional understanding. The Indian Govt. is bound to protect the rich source of traditional knowledge by not allowing multinationals to get patents on traditional culture. As a defensive mechanism, the Govt. has created TKDL (Traditional Knowledge Digital Library) to challenge patenting traditional Indian understanding. Multinationals and developed countries are also opposing this move.Intellectual Property Rights (India): Neglected IssuesIn Manipur context, main issues of IPR are: Lack of awareness about IPR among people; there are no state specific IPR policies; there are issues related to bio piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge; Poor protection for indigenous designs, arts and crafts. In fact unique Manipuri crafts lack IP protection and absence of GI tag as results motifs of copying Manipuri designs by outsiders is a well-known fact. The case of King Chili (Uoo Morok) is an example as it was claimed as the assets of Nagaland and case of Modi Ghamsha in UP, copying of Rani Fee as well as Wangkhei fee designs by outsiders etc. Therefore we need awareness drives about IPR importance; formulate IPR policies and incentives; set up IP felicitation center for promoting innovation; protect traditional knowledge digitally and support GI and branding indigenous goods.(Writer can be reached at:[email protected]) "
