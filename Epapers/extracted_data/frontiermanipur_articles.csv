bjp-cong-face-off-war-of-words-over-war-on-drugs-in-manipur,"As acrimonious and politically evocative comments are exchanged, the silent majority still remains quiet for reasons best feared by them.By Wakching LaiWhile the government of Manipur has been intensifying its efforts to wage an ostensibly serious ‘War on Drugs’ by making key seizures, arrests and destruction of poppy plantation in the hill areas with tall claims of success, there has been another War of Words between the ruling BJP and opposition Congress Party in recent weeks.The most recent showdown between the BJP and Congress had been triggered by the seizure of a huge consignment of drugs from a team of Manipur commando personnel by Kakching district police on January 16, 2023 at Pallel (Kuraopokpi) along Moreh-Imphal highway.Soon after the seizure of the drugs from the commando team, Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president and Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Wangkhem Assembly Constituency K Meghachandra visited the office of the Superintendent of Police (SP) Kakching and later addressed the media in connection with the incident.Reacting to the visit of the MLA, chief minister N Biren Singh is reported to have promptly stated that no MLA came to inquire when the police department destroyed drug manufacturing units. However, when seizures were made from police personnel, one of the MLAs visited the office of the SP, Kakching. The chief minister had apparently warned that the elected member who went to the SP’s office should take responsibility if there were hurdles in solving the drug case.The BJP Manipur Pradesh vice-president Ch Chidananda also said that Congress party should not indulge in populism taking advantage of the situation in which police personnel were involved. Speaking to media persons at the BJP office recently, Chidananda said that the Congress party should stop projecting the War on Drugs as a “game” and refrain from obstructing police officers from performing their duties.FIR against MLA Meghachandra, KennedyLater, it was learnt that Kakching Police had registered an FIR against MLA Meghachandra and a Congress member Kshetrimayum Kennedy of Kakching. According to the FIR registered on January 21, the complainant accused the MLA and Kennedy of “obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, criminal trespass with common intention – punishable under section 186/447/34 IPC”. The complaint further stated that when the SP returned to his office between 3pm to 3.15pm, he found that the MLA and Kennedy were already there. Through social media, the SP came to notice that K Meghachandra had given an interview to the press after leaving the office “without any intimation to him”.According to the complaint, the SP had submitted that “providing interview to the social media at a time when the peak of investigation is underway and at a location where investigation work is going on, acts as ahuge distractionfor the police who are investigating a case, especially in the house immediately after the detection of a crime”.“Further, passingunpleasant remarkson the war on drugs initiative and in close proximity to the place where investigation is under going without intimation to the undersigned serves as a huge distraction to the working of the police.  Such activities dampen the momentum of investigation and acts as an obstruction while performing the duties of police. It is therefore, requested to kindly registered a regular case for proper investigation”, said the complainant.READ FULL TEXT OF FIR-COMPLAINT HERE:FIR_NO._11_01__2023_KCG-PSMore Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024Congress ReactsReacting to the allegations of the BJP and the complaint, Congress leader O Joy in a press briefing stated that after the seizure of illegal drugs from a police commando team’s vehicle, MLA Meghachandra went to the SP’s office at Kakching and expressed his opinions and views. He indicated that it was under the instruction of the chief minister, an FIR was filed against the MLA and a congress member.O Joy further stated, “We should note that all the democracies of the world and their elected representatives are enjoying the power, privilege and immunities under respective provisions of their constitutions. All states in India and all members of the Commonwealth are enjoying the same privilege…..It is not a sin or crime to enter the offices of government functionaries”, he said.The Congress leader pointed out that all representatives and civil servants are governed by certain principles and conventions. “It is not a crime. It is permissible under law and parliamentary practices. And if the state decides to apprehend an MLA for visiting the office or police officer, is it not a violation of the same convention and laws provided under the constitution….It amounts to breach of privilege of an honourable member of the house. And it would amount to contempt of the house… Where will the value of parliamentary democracy be if a prime minister start instructing police to arrest elected members of the parliament?”, O Joy argued and asked.While appreciating the efforts put in by the Manipur chief minister N Brien Singh, the Congress leader pointed out that “there are so many questions that can be asked to the government on its War on Drugs. So many drugs have been seized, but where have all the seized drugs gone? Every seizure has to be properly accounted while maintaining accountability….there are some lapses on the part of the government”Hand over drugs related cases to CBI, Congress proposesManipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has proposed that all illegal drugs related cases reported between 2012 and till date be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) so that the same can be independently investigated.As the war of words unfolded, the BJP also raised the question of 28 cases involving security personnel when the Congress was in power in the state and had sought to know if any of these cases were investigated by the CBI.The Congress was quick to point out that during the Congress government headed by O Ibobi Singh, a huge consignment of drugs was seized at Pallel from some individuals including a military officer. The party said that after the incident, the military officer was dismissed from service and one drugs related case in which a relative of O Ibobi Singh was alleged/suspected to be involved, had been handed over to CBI under strong public pressure.Amid allegations and counter allegations flying thick and fast, a youth Congress leader Ningthoujam Popilal on January 25 reportedly stated that there is a high probability that police personnel are being used as drug transporters in the state.“If police personnel are used for transportation in drug business, then where will the war on drug go?,” he asked.The youth leader pointed out the possibility of involvement of high profile persons in the case and even demanded the chief minister and the DGP to resign on moral ground if they are unable to face drug related cases honestly.The war of words continues. As acrimonious and politically evocative comments are exchanged, the silent majority still remains quiet for reasons bestfearedby them. The impact of a war as such has the possibility to not only fuel angst but also confuse the common people on the interpretation of facts on the ground, on one hand and the façade of a statist response to a crisis that is real and hard, on the other.  The public as well as the critics of the measures adopted by the state government, are trying to figure out if there is any space left for them to freely express their views. However, they will have their way someday."

will-hasinas-win-benefit-indias-northeastern-region,"Hasina’s victory has been termed as a positive outcome for the India’s landlocked  north-eastern region   as many strategic and infrastructure related bilateral agreements between Dhaka and New Delhi are on the card.By Nava ThakuriaAs Bangladesh went to polls on 7 January 2024 amidst violence and boycott call from the prime opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), it was well predicted that the ruling Awami League (AL) led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will win for the fourth consecutive term to lead the poverty stricken south Asian nation for another five years. Consequently, the 12thgeneral election on Sunday (a working day for the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people) gave an absolute majority to the incumbent AL with 222 seats in Jatiya Sansad, the highest legislative body of the populous country strategically located between India and Myanmar.The parliamentary election to 350-member Jatiya Sansad (where 50 women members are elected indirectly) reflecting a poor voters’ turnout (less than 42% of 120 million registered electorates exercised their franchise) witnessed the electoral victory of 62 independent candidates (many even defeated AL  nominees), a record since its birth as a nation in 1971. A compromised opposition Jatiya Party won only 11 seats and  three smaller parties emerged winning one constituency each (where polling took place in 298 constituencies).The polling began at 8 am on 7 January 2014 and continued uninterrupted till  4 pm under high security arrangements as the country often reports widespread poll-related violence. Over 750,000 police and paramilitary forces were deployed on the ground, where Bangladesh Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel were on duty to ensure security during the single day polling in 261,912 booths under 42,024 voting centres across  the country.To motivate the electorate, even PM Hasina cast her vote as the first individual in Dhaka City College polling station. She was accompanied by her sister Sheikh Rehana and daughter Saima Wazed. More than 200 foreign observers representing over 30 countries and global organisations visited the country to monitor the electoral process. Three senior members of the Election Commission of India also joined the group. Over  20,000 Bangladeshi observers representing 84 organizations were also engaged in the process. Bangladesh chief election commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal assured of a free, fair and neutral polling.Sporadic incidents of violence and rigging of polls were reported, as BNP leaders called for a 48-hour Hartal (general strike) beginning the previous day to polls. Alleging that elections under Hasina’s government would never be free and fair, the BNP and its political allies stick to their demand to conduct the polls under a caretaker neutral government in Dhaka, which Hasina strongly denied.  Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical political party of Bangladesh, even took out processions in the capital city on the polling day supporting the BNP’s boycott call.A  mass rally on 28 October by the BNP and its friendly parties turned violent, where at least four people were killed and nearly 300 vehicles torched on the streets of  Dhaka. The government started a massive crackdown and put thousands of BNP leaders (including its secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir) and workers behind the bars.  Another BNP rally on 16 December witnessed the participation of hundreds of thousands of people reiterating their demand for Hasina to resign before the polls.On the eve of polls, a series of violent incidents rocked the country. The burning of Kamalapur railway station bound Benapole Express’s four coaches by the miscreants resulted in the death of five passengers and injuries to many others. Next morning, a polling station (under Bandar police station) and a vehicle were torched in Chittagong locality. Two more people were killed on the counting day of ballot papers.Meanwhile, the UN rights chief expressed serious concern over the violence and repression reported during the electoral exercise in Bangladesh. Violations and irregularities during the campaign and on election-day should be thoroughly investigated, asserted the global rights chief, adding that the hard earned democracy in the country should not become cosmetic. The United States and the UK  stated that the Bangladesh elections were neither free nor fair. Washington also observed that thousands of political opposition members were arrested and all political parties were not associated with the electoral exercise, adding that Dhaka should investigate reports of violence and make the perpetrators accountable.Terming the election as a fake one, the BNP leaders claimed that such a low turnout in the polling indicated the people’s rejection following the boycott call. Alleging the Hasina government of running fabricated cases against 5,00,000 BNP leaders, civil society representatives and media personnel as well imprisoning over 1,700 party workers in the last 15 years, they asserted  that the Bangladeshi voters thoroughly rejected the one-sided election. Now the BNP leaders have decided to intensify their movement against the fake regime with a series of peaceful public demonstrations across the country. BNP also boycotted the 2014 parliamentary polls, but contested half-heartedly in the 2018 election after discussions with Hasina, where she assured full neutrality but allegedly did not keep her words.More Stories like this3rd North East Games 2024 kickstarts with musical…Mar 19, 2024Police Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024BNP’s president Khaleda Zia (78 years old) is currently ailing and amazingly the former Bangla Premier is also under house arrest for graft charges. Even the party’s acting president Tarique Rahman, son of former Bangla President Ziaur Rahman and Begum Zia, has been living in self-imposed exile since 2008. Tarique faced 18 months jail term before leaving to London and staying there till date. So the party remains almost a leaderless political force on the ground and BNP leaders were assumed not interested in contesting the elections.Dhaka-based  political analysts argue that it was indeed an opposition-less election indeed as  Jatiya Party also received political  favour from the ruling AL. Initially, the Hussain Muhammad Ershad founded party was planning to boycott the election along with the BNP-led opposition alliance.  But  the ruling party vacated 26 seats for their nominees to get the only opposition party on the fray. Hasina’s party also encouraged more AL leaders to file nominations so that the election can be shown as a participatory one. Most of the independent candidates were either deprived AL leaders or just dummies. Thus Bangladesh has emerged as a one-party nation, where the logical question arises who would play the role of opposition in the parliament.The Paris-based global media rights body Reporters Sans/Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the violence against the journalists during the Bangladesh polls, when at least 12 reporters were attacked and expelled or denied entry to voting stations, in most cases by supporters of Hasina’s party. The AL supporters attacked reporters covering the cases of electoral fraud, asserted the RSF, adding that the relevant authorities should launch independent probes so that the responsible individuals can be brought to justice.“Furthermore, in a context of stifled media freedom, muzzled by governmental suppression of all criticism, we urge the newly re-elected authorities to finally adopt strong measures to safeguard unrestricted Internet access and protect the freedom of the press enshrined in Bangladesh’s constitution and freedom of expression, which is being obstructed by the draconian new cyber security act. The government’s toxic control over news and information must end,” asserted the statement.On a polling day marked by tension – with the main opposition party (BNP) boycotting the polls- many journalists were physically attacked or were subjected to harassment and intimidation, and were either expelled from or denied entry to voting stations. Most of the harassment and violence was the work of ruling AL supporters targeting reporters trying to cover irregularities.  In another serious violation of the right to report, access to the website of a Bengali newspaper was blocked. The newspaper management claimed that it had no internal technical issues when it experienced the access problems in the alternate media space on 6 January.“The Bangladeshi authorities also refused to issue visas to journalists from the headquarters of many leading international media outlets, including BBC News, New York Times, Bloomberg, Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Al Jazeera. Most of the foreign reporters who managed to obtain visas were those based in New Delhi. Some foreign reporters were also asked to sign a statement accepting that their photographs and video footage would have to be approved by the Bangla authorities before being sent, and could not harm the national image,” asserted the statement.Hasina (76),  who earlier ruled the country as its premier during  1996 to 2001, had won the last three national elections conducted since  2008 and established herself as the longest-serving government head among women in the world. Daughter of Bangabondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina maintained that only her party can lead Bangladesh towards peace, prosperity and growth. In the election manifesto, Hasina promised to convert the digital Bangladesh to a smart nation. She also committed to protect and promote the spirit of democracy, offer quality education to youths, modernise agriculture, and make healthcare services affordable to all Bangladeshi nationals.Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, Pranay Verma was the first foreign diplomat to call on Hasina at Ganabhawan to convey greetings after her re-election and victory to her party. Ambassadors representing China, Russia, Bhutan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka etc also soon followed and assured cooperation from their government &  countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Hasina on her poll victory and pledged a mutually trusted relationship with Dhaka. Hasina reciprocated the goodwill from New Delhi.Her victory has been termed as a positive outcome for the India’s landlocked  north-eastern region   as many strategic and infrastructure related bilateral agreements between Dhaka and New Delhi are on the card. The healthy working relationship between Hasina and  Modi  helped influence the Bangla government to crack down on  north-eastern militants  taking shelter in their soil. Dhaka also agreed to develop rail connectivity with India (from Agartala to Akhaura and Benapol to Kolkata) and allow four of its seaports (including Chittagong and Mongla) to be used by Indian traders.Moreover, Hasina permitted the use of waterways touching the Bangladesh territory to connect the mighty river Brahmaputra with the mainland Indian ports for transporting goods and also tourists. The world’s longest river cruise (from Varanasi to Dibrugarh) covering a 3,200 kilometers long route turned into a reality because of Dhakas’ cooperation. As Bangladesh is dependent on essential agri-products like rice, sugar, onions,  garlic, ginger, with many  other items from India, its relationship with New Delhi will help them in a better way. But for any reason, the stability of the government and law & order situation in Bangladesh will be an utmost priority for Hasina.Traditionally New Delhi remains sympathetic to Hasina’s regime  as she maintains seemingly a comfortable relationship with India (read the Hindus in her country). Even though many Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries were vandalised by the radical Islamists from  time to time with impunity during her long time rule too.

Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma unveiled the statue of Bhimbar Deuri and a bhawan at Borbari in Guwahati.By Nava ThakuriaA dedicated tribal leader turned true nationalist Bhimbar Deuri was recently remembered for his extraordinary contributions to the country, while it was preparing to adopt a new identity as a sovereign nation after decades of foreigner’s rule. The gorgeous function at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra in the city on 30 November 2023 witnessed various programs on Jananeta’s 76th death anniversary, where the guests spoke a volume about the legendary personality and a successful organizer.Patronaged by Assam government’s cultural affairs department and initiated by Deuri Autonomous Council (DAC), All Assam Deuri Students’ Union (AADSU) along with the concerned residents of Guwahati, the Bhimbar Deuri Divas was graced by State chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma along with State legislative assembly speaker Biswajit Daimary, State minister Ranoj Pegu, legislator Bolin Chetia, Kalakshetra secretary Sudarshan Thakur, principal secretary to cultural affairs department B Kalyan Chakravarthy, DAC chief Bhairav Deuri, AADSU president Niren Deuri, secretary Tapan Deuri, etc.More Stories like thisPolice Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024PPFA appreciates Assamese society on CAA understandingMar 16, 2024‘Hamari Vaani’ for persons with disabilities foray into…Mar 8, 2024CM Sarma, who unveiled the statue of Bhimbar Deuri and a bhawan at Borbari in the city virtually from the dais, paid floral tribute to the most popular leader from the indigenous community of Assam before delivering his elaborate speech. The saffron leader termed Bhimbar Deuri as a visionary personality who always raised voices for the benefit of indigenous people. Maintaining a strong stand against the infiltrators, Bhimbar Deuri played a vital role along with Assam’s first chief minister Gopinath Bordoloi in dismantling the conspiracy of British colonial forces to include the region in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the partition. Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi termed him as a Jananeta (people’s leader).Bhimbar Deuri (16 May 1903 – 30 November 1947) was also a successful lawyer, who logically fought against the British officers in accommodating due space for the tribals in general and common residents in general. One of the prime architects of Khasi Darbar Hall Resolutions (21–23 March 1945), where various ethnic leaders resolved for independence, Bhimbar Deuri also played a leading role in forming Assam Backward Plains Tribal League (1933). An undisputed leader among different tribes in Assam, Bhimbar Deuri insisted on sanctioning land pattas to indigenous Assamese families, primary education to every child and adequate political patronage to the deprived section in the society.A souvenir was also published on the occasion, where a number of articles highlighting different aspects of Bhimbar Deuri’s life & struggles were incorporated. Edited by award-winning writer Bipul Deuri, the souvenir reprinted some articles penned by veteran personalities like Nibaran Bora, Golap Borbora, Medini Choudhury, Indibar Deuri etc. It also comprises thought-provoking pieces by eminent author-scholars namely Hiren Gohain, Udayaditya Bharali, Anil Bharali, Paramanda Majumder, Mayur Bora along with Dilip Patgiri, Adip Kr Phukan, Ratneswar Deuri, Soranan Deuri, Nandeswar Deuri, Anup Kumar Deuri, Hem Ranjan Deuri, Subanti Deuri, Rupjyoti Konwar, Ratneswar Basumatary, Bhadreswar Deuri, Niroj Kr Raimedhi, Binu Deuri Barua, etc.In my speech as the assigned speaker, I emphasized on recognizing Bhimbar Deuri in all India level with a national award. Moreover, his contributions should get their due space in the history of India’s freedom movement. The educational institutions may consider academic research on his activities and an annual lecture will be an important tribute to the great social equalizer. At the same time, Assam should start debating over an upper house (Bhimbar Deuri was also a member of Assam Legislative Council in the pre-independence era), so that the tribals and underdeveloped communities with tiny populations can enjoy the political space they deserve."

millions-of-children-will-soon-need-aadhaar-ids-to-access-their-right-to-a-nutritious-meal-says-report-by-trc,"In March 2022, the government of India made Aadhaar compulsory for the country’s nutrition programme. Earlier, in November 2021, the government threatened state governments that it would curtail financial support for the scheme, restricting it to only beneficiaries verified through Aadhaar.A Report byTapasya/The Reporters Collective (TRC)In a move that would jeopardise access to nutritious food by poor children and women, the government of India has made it mandatory for beneficiaries of its supplementary nutrition programme—which provides children up to the age of six, pregnant women and lactating mothers with free nutritious food—to have Aadhaar numbers so they are registered on India’s national identity database.Experts say that the move violates a Supreme Court order that no subsidy or service may be denied for want of an Aadhaar number. India’s national nutrition mission provides free food to 79 million children aged six months to six years and 15 million pregnant, lactating women. Only 23% of children under five have Aadhaar cards.According to a report byThe Reporters Collective (TRC), previously undisclosed official correspondence and guidelines of theministry of women and child developmentaccessed byThe Reporters’ Collectiverevealed that in March 2022 the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi made Aadhaar compulsory for the nutrition programme. Earlier, in November 2021, the government threatened state governments that it would curtail financial support for the scheme, restricting it to only beneficiaries verified through Aadhaar.READ THE FULL REPORT HERE:https://article-14.com/post/millions-of-children-will-soon-need-aadhaar-ids-to-access-their-right-to-a-nutritious-meal–62bc915131cc9The Union government followed it up with the states on 23 June, asking them to hasten the linking of Aadhaar identities of beneficiaries to use the free-food programme.The objective, according to the report by TRC, was to weed out fake beneficiaries and to boost a mobile app that tracks beneficiaries atanganwadisand the services they provide.Currently, 79 million children between the age of six months and six years benefit from the supplementary nutrition programme. But, only 23% of children below the age of five have Aadhaar, according toofficial records.Many of them could be denied a legally guaranteed right if Aadhaar is made a prerequisite. (The supplementary nutrition scheme was converted into a legal entitlement in 2013 when theNational Food Security Actwas passed.)Under the programme, in order to provide improved nutrition to children up to the age of six years, pregnant women and new mothers, beneficiaries aregivenhot cooked meals or take-home rations fromanganwadicentres where they are registered.The enforcement of Aadhaar registration for children came despite a 2018 Supreme Courtrulingthat children cannot be denied services or benefits for lack of a unique identification number. In addition, an April 2022Comptroller and Auditor General of India(CAG)reportalso criticised the use of Aadhaar for children below five years of age, said the report byThe Reporters Collective (TRC).Once beneficiaries begin to be dropped for want of Aadhaar cards, millions could lose the benefits of the supplementary nutrition programme, particularly in poorer states, said Dipa Sinha, assistant professor (economics) at Ambedkar University, Delhi.“While states like Tamil Nadu that have a strong and better-financed child development services framework can support beneficiaries without Aadhaar, poorer states and those entirely dependent on central funding will deny nutrition to children and women,” said Sinha, who is also associated with theRight to Food Campaign, an advocacy group responsible for making food a legal entitlement in India.The union government funds half the cost of the supplementary nutrition programme in several states and union territories, 90% in the north-eastern and Himalayan states, and 100% in union territories without a legislature.Aadhaar For Nutrition: The Centre’s PushThe Modi government’s intention to enforce Aadhaar for beneficiaries of the nutrition scheme has been clear since 2021.The women and child development ministry has operated the supplementary nutrition programme in its current form since 2006 under theIntegrated Child Development Services(ICDS) scheme, which was launched in 1975 and is the world’s largest such programme.In 2018, the Modi government launched an integrated National Nutrition Mission orPoshan Abhiyaan, to monitor, regulate and implement nutrition-related schemes run by various ministries. The supplementary nutrition programme was subsumed into it.In2018, the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software), built by an Indian private company and theBill & Melinda Gates Foundationto monitor the outcomes of nutrition schemes, was rolled out under the National Nutrition Mission. Itfailed, only to be replaced by another mobile app. This one was built by theunion ministry of electronics and information technology. It was named thePoshan Tracker.In November 2021, the union government told states that Aadhaar details of beneficiaries should be linked to the Poshan Tracker by December 15. It said the funds for the scheme from the union government would be based on the data fed into the Poshan Tracker.In March 2022, the ministry sent detailed guidelines to states on its nutrition mission, including schemes under the ICDS.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024The guidelines said, “Only those beneficiaries who are registered at the anganwadi centres are entitled to receive supplementary nutrition. The beneficiaries must compulsorily be in possession of Aadhaar card and shall submit Aadhaar number at the time of registration…”In other words, only those beneficiaries, including children, who have Aadhaar would be registered for the take-home rations, hot cooked meals and other benefits that anganwadi centres provide.Beneficiaries would also be required to carry their Aadhaar cards to theanganwadicentre every time they went to collect rations or food, the guidelines said.On 23 June, the centre again urged the states to link the Aadhaar numbers of all beneficiaries registered withanganwadicentres to the Poshan Tracker.According to experts, given the UIDAI’swarningthat Aadhaar cards or numbers alone are not adequate to confirm a person’s identity,anganwadiworkers would have toauthenticateevery beneficiary’s Aadhaar number along with her or his demographic or biometric information that must be sent online to the UIDAI’s Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) for verification. Demographic details include name, date of birth, address and gender, while biometric information refers to facial image, fingerprints and iris scan.Mostanganwadiworkers and the senior state officials we spoke to said it would not be practical to authenticate beneficiaries’ Aadhaar numbers each time they arrive for a meal or for a pack of groceries they are entitled to.Aadhaar Over Children’s Right To FoodFor poor families, getting an Aadhaar card for infants and children may be a challenging task. Even in India’s capital, Delhi, families were worried about the enforcement of Aadhaar for the nutrition scheme.“We give meals even to children who do not have Aadhaar cards,” said ananganwadiworker at the South Delhi centre where Samidha Khatoon receives food for her children. Theanganwadiworker preferred to remain anonymous. “But we have been told by our supervisor that in future, meals will be given only to children who have an Aadhaar.”The Union government has left it to state officials andanganwadiworkers to ensure that the nutrition supplements reach all beneficiaries without disruption while enforcing the Aadhaar and that beneficiaries register with UIDAI for their Aadhaar.The Global Hunger Index for 2021, a peer-reviewed annual report by international aid organisations, recorded a dip inIndia’s rankingto 101 among 116 countries, a score that pegged its hunger as a “serious” crisis, despite improvements in some indicators since 2000.‘Fill Gaps In System To Improve Nutrition’For 2021-22, the governmentgrantedapproval to consider 2011 Census figures,anganwadiregistrations and number of beneficiaries as reported by the states in reimbursing them for the supplementary nutrition programme. It is unclear if such an approval will be given for 2022-23.Some states including Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were given the option of linking beneficiary children’s mothers’ Aadhaar cards to the Poshan Tracker.“There are two types of errors within the system. One is someone not entitled to receive the benefit of a scheme,” said Yogesh Ranganath, a development practitioner who works on nutrition and access to entitlements. “The other is someone eligible to receive the benefit being shunted out due to the lack of a document, Aadhaar in this case. The latter is the problem that would affect genuine beneficiaries.”Besides threatening to cut assistance to states, the government has also turned the screws onanganwadiworkers. Their incentiveshingeon “expeditious inputting of data” in the tracker. The guidelines also thrust on officials andanganwadiworkers the responsibility to help beneficiaries get their Aadhaar cards made.TheReporters’ Collectivespoke to senior officials in charge of the supplementary nutrition programme in two other states, and asked them about the Aadhaar linkage and Poshan Tracker-driven oversight mechanism threatening to deny millions of children their right to nutrition support provided at theanganwadis.At every review meeting, there was pressure on officials to ensure Aadhaar linkage of all beneficiaries, one official said. Most remote areas in his state did not have adequate internet connectivity. “Less than a fourth of children have Aadhaar countrywide. How will it happen? I doubt they would take the actual step of depriving children of food,” he said. “I hope not. Let’s see.”In an eastern state, an official warned that unless the state found a workaround, the union government’s directives could cause a massive disruption in delivery of rations and food to beneficiaries.Both officials wished to stay anonymous.Dipa Sinha of Ambedkar University said the union government’s focus should have instead been on filling gaps in the existing system in order to provide nutrition. She said the Poshan Tracker website and Aadhaar linkage do not lead to any progress in supplementary nutrition programme’s objectives. “The tracker does not show how stunting, wasting and other indicators have improved or otherwise,” she said, “and the unique id has many failings we have seen in other schemes.”(Tapasya is a member ofThe Reporters’ Collective, a journalism collaborative that publishes in multiple languages and media.

Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has remanded the three persons to 10-day custody from March 13 to March 23, 2024.On the arrest of the UNLF (P) leaders, N Biren Singh had reportedly stated that the state government was not officially intimated about the arrest. However, it has come to light that the NIA on March 13, the day the three were arrested, had officially informed the Superintendent of Police (SP), Imphal West about the arrest in NIA Case No. RC 23/2023/NIA Delhi-reg. The intimation letter to the SP Imphal West also asked him to inform the family members of the three accused.The NIA letter to SP confirmed the arrest of Thokchom Shyamjai Singh @ Thokchom Gyaneshor @ Thoiba @ Zatawn, @ Zaw Tun @ Shidabamapu, aged 45, son of (late) Th lbotombi, resident of Mayang Imphal, Imphal West; Laimayum Anand Sharma @ Ingba, aged 50, son of (late) L Indreshwar Sharma, resident of Yaiskul Hiruhanba Leikai, Imphal West; and Salam Ibomcha Meitei @ Landaba, aged 38, son of Lokeswar Meitei, resident of Salam Keikhu Langjing, Imphal West. The NIA court granted the remand plea on March 13.As per reports, Thoiba alias Sidabamapu is the “chief of army” of UNLF (P) while Ingba was the “chief intelligence” and another cade named Landaba was a “corporal” of the outfit.The three Pambei-led UNLF cadres were taken into custody in connection with case number RC 23/2023/NIA/DLI by NIA, New Delhi. The case is related to a “transnational conspiracy by Myanmar based leadership of militant outfits to wage war against the government of India by exploiting the current ethnic unrest in Manipur.” The three were charged under section 120 B, 121 A, 122 of the IPC and sec 18 (B),39 of the UAPA 1967.It may be recalled that Moirangthem Anand along with four others were arrested by a team of NIA in connection with the same case number 23 of 2023 of NIA, New Delhi on September 21, 2023. It is under the same case that the three UNLF (P) members were arrested.Moirangthem Anand was airlifted to New Delhi and he is now lodged in Tihar Jail. Whereas, the four others were released on bail. The NIA has registered the case as suo-moto on July 19, 2023 with case number 23 of 2023 NIA, New Delhi. It now remains to be seen how UNLF (P) leaders are actually related to the case mentioned. UNLF (P) is currently under a “peace agreement” with the Government of India.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024Read Details:https://thefrontiermanipur.com/unlf-under-leadership-of-chairman-kh-pambei-decides-to-sign-ceasefire-pact-with-goi-for-onward-political-negotiation/What exactly is NIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI?NIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI is also known as the “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case”. The chargesheet filed under section 173 Cr. PC in the Court of Special Judge, NIA Patiala House, New Delhi in the Union of India Versus Hangshi Tangkhul and others, states that:“The central government had received credible inputs in respect of a transnational conspiracy hatched by Myanmar based leadership of terror outfits operationally active in the North Eastern Indian states to exploit the current ethnic unrest in the state of Manipur to wage a war against the Government of India and execute terrorist attacks thereby exacerbating the current security situation in Manipur.”The chargesheet dispatched on 07-03-2023 says that “China-Myanmar module of NSCN (I-M) based in Myanmar under the leadership of Hangshi Tangkhul and Absolom Tangkhul” have decided to extend support to proscribed organisations, Kanglei Yawol Kanba Lup (KYKL) and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to “infiltrate their cadres into the Indian territory” for carrying out attacks inside the country. For this purpose, the NSCN (I-M) leaders promised “a safe passage along with arms, ammunition, explosives and other terrorist hardware” to Manipur based outfits and proscribed organisations.“In addition, these outfits have also been tasked to identify, recruit and train impressionable youths and get then involved in the ongoing violence with the larger goal of destabilizing the security situation in Manipur and to further wage a war against the Government of India”, said the same chargesheet.Hence, a case was registered on 19-07-2023 by the NIA in compliance of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Codes and The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UA(P) Act 1967).Subsequently on 16-09-2023, Moirangthem Anand along with four others were arrested by a team of NIA in connection with the same case number 23 of 2023 of NIA, New Delhi on September 21, 2023.Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case and armed groups in NortheastNIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI or “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case” in the chargesheet submitted earlier clearly makes an attempt to establish how groups like National Socialist Council of Nagalim – NSCN (I-M), KYKL and PLA extended support to each other. However, how the leaders of the Pambei-led UNLF are related to the “conspiracy” is one big question being asked by political watchers and observers in Manipur.“The centre, particularly the Ministry of Home Affairs seems to be working on a grand plan to implicate as many armed political groups operating in Manipur and across the Indo-Myanmar border irrespective of whether they are in different stages of political engagements with New Delhi. Hence, we see even the NSCN (I-M) has also been linked with KYKL or PLA and now even UNLF (P) in the  NIA’s “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case”. All these apparently pertain to those armed groups who supposedly waging a war against India”, opines a political observer who does not want to be identified.There had been valley-wide protests launched by several civil society organisations on the arrest of the three leaders. One common refrain that can be heard from the public is “How can leaders or cadres of an outfit under peace agreement with the Government of India be arrested by NIA randomly?” or “What impact would such arrests being made with the official green signal from the Ministry of Home Affairs have on the way how the peace-agreement unfolds?”. As protests over the arrest of UNLF (P) leaders continue, the would definitely be some form of strategized operations to keep the proscribed armed groups in Manipur and the Northeast India under the control of New Delhi while observers are kept on tenterhooks."
fixing-poll-date-on-sunday-is-against-sentiments-of-christians,"Former MP BD Behring urges ECI to rearrange the Polling date for the first phase to serve the interest of every citizen in Manipur and also preserve the sanctity of the Indian Constitution.By BD BehringThis is a humble appeal to the Election Commission of India and CEO Manipur State to review its earlier 12th General Elections notification vide its Press Note No.ECI/PN//2022 dated 8th January, 2022 which scheduled the date of poll for the 9 (nine) Hill Assembly Constituencies on 27th February 2022 (Sunday).The said 9 (nine) Assembly Constituencies are — 46- Saikul (ST), 50- Kangopkpi 51- Saitu (ST), 55- Tipaimukh (ST), 56- Thanton (ST), 57 Henglep (ST), 58- Churuchanpur (ST), 59-Saikot (ST) and 60- Singhat (ST).More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024The people residing in these Assembly Constituencies are Predominantly Christians. Fixing the Poll date on Sunday is against the Religious sentiment of the majority Christian community. We should also uphold the Principles of the Indian Constitution which clearly indicate India as “Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic”.As per earlier notifications since the number of Assembly Constituencies going for the Polls in First Phase is 38 and Second Phase is 22 only, it will be more appropriate to modify the order and include the 9 (nine) Hill Assembly Constituencies in the Second Phase which is scheduled on 03-03-2022 (Thursday). Hence the total number of Assembly Constituencies going for Poll in the Second Phase will be 31.This re-arrangement of Polling date will serve the interest of every citizen in Manipur and also preserve the sanctity of the Indian Constitution.(BD Behring is a former MP (Rajya Sabha) and MLA of Manipur Legislative Assembly)"

The brave journalist, who is currently working from Switzerland as deputy editor of Novaya Gazeta Europe, was honoured with the prestigious award in the Swish city on Monday.Last year the award, dedicated to protection of journalists and press freedom on the ground, went to Indian journalist Nava Thakuria from Guwahati, the year before to Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui, to the Afghan Journalists Centre director Ahmed Quraishi (2019), while it went the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia (murdered in Malta during October 2017) in 2018.“The state of press freedom in Russia has deteriorated considerably since the Russian invasion of Ukraine decided by President Vladimir Putin in February 2022. Many Russian journalists have chosen to go into exile to continue to work freely. The PEC 2022 award is dedicated to them,” said Blaise Lempen, president of PEC (https://pressemblem.ch/pec-award.shtml).Ms Glikman has been working for Novaya Gazeta for more than 20 years and has collaborated with journalist Anna Politkovskaya until her killing in 2006 and Nobel peace prize winner Dmitry Muratov, among others. By March 2022, Novaya Gazeta was forced to cease its activities in Russia and next month Novaya Gazeta Europe outlet was established. Married to a Swiss journalist, Ms Glikman lives in Schaffhausen.“Ekaterina continues her fight for free information from Switzerland. She and the entire Novaya Gazeta Europe team deserve our encouragement until Russia finds its way back to freedom. It is in Moscow that the fate of Ukrainians and Europe is at stake and we must support the Russians who oppose the war crimes perpetrated every day by the Kremlin in Ukraine,” added Lempen.Speaking about the award, Ms Glickman stated that receiving the PEC award is an incredible moral support. ‘All these months of war we, those Russians who are against the war, torture ourselves with the question- how did we let this happen ? It is hard to live with. So thank you for your encouragement,’ added Ms Glickman.“I started working as a journalist the same time as Putin came to power. So I witnessed how the space of free journalism shrank during his rule until it disappeared completely. If it is no longer possible to provide Russians with truthful information being in Russia, then it must be done from abroad. Does it make any sense if the country is poisoned by years of propaganda? My answer is yes as they should not be left with propaganda,” she said.The year 2022 is shaping up to be one of the deadliest for journalism, with more than 100 journalists killed since January so far. According to the Institute for Mass Information, an Ukrainian NGO based in Kiev, more than 40 journalists have died in the war since February 2022. Of these, about ten were killed while on assignment, others as members of the Ukrainian army personnel or as ordinary civilians.PEC, the global safety and media rights body, was founded in Geneva in 2004 by a group of journalists of several nationalities to strengthen the protection and safety of media workers around the world. Since 2009, it has awarded its annual prize to an individual or organisation working for the protection of journalists and press freedom in the field."

recalibrating-india-nepal-relationship,"India has to “review” its approach in light of the current socio, economical and political dynamics of Nepal. Because of the difficult terrain and geographicaldistance from China’s East coast, the destiny of Nepal is tied with India.By Lt General LN Singh (R)India is an emerging superpower, having a rapidly growing economy and a world- class military force coupled with a vast geographical area and has to play an important role in the South Asian region besides the geopolitics and economy of the whole world. Accordingly, the Indian foreign policy follows the dictum of neighbours first.India and Nepal share similar ties in terms of Hinduism and Buddhism with Buddha’s birthplace Lumbini located in Nepal. The two countries not only share an open border and unhindered movement of people, but they also have close bonds through marriages and familial ties, popularly known as ‘Roti-Beti ka Rishta,.Rivers originating in Nepal feed the perennial river systems of India in terms of ecology and hydropower potential.Many Hindu and Buddhist religious sites are in Nepal making it an important pilgrim site for a large number of Indians.India is Nepal’s largest trade partner and the largest source of foreign investments, besides providing transit for almost the entire third-country trade of Nepal.India is playing a very crucial role by extending its support to Nepal in every possible manner. But some issues demand some mid-course corrections in India’s Nepal policy.Nepal is a buffer state between India & China and has a very unique position in India’s foreign and national security policy. Ever-growing Chinese presence in Nepal is seriously a strategic and political concern of India. China’s influence is relentlessly undermining India’s role in Nepal. Therefore, India has to pay more emphasis on its foreign relations with Nepal.Thus it is imperative to analyze India’s relations with Nepal by keeping China’s engagement in Nepal in view. In addition, attention must be paid to the future challenges that are crucial for – political and economic stability, and most importantly the security of Nepal to make India’s foreign policy more effective, result oriented to safeguarding and expanding India’s strategic and political interests.Nepal’s politics for quite some time can at the best be described as a fragile democracy. Promulgation of the Nepali Constitution ensured the guarantee for the smooth functioning of Nepal’s politics but in actuality, the trajectory of political events is not progressing as would have been necessary political stability in Nepal.China has invested very heavily invested on K P Sharma Oli and developed a very cordial relationship with him basically to counter the Nepali Congress and Madhesi Parties that are known as pro-India, China played a very crucial role in bringing together various left-wing factions to fulfil its geopolitical ambitions.Nepal Communists Party (NCP), an alliance was formed by merging the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) of K P Sharma Oli and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal with the support of Chinese. In addition, another factor for Nepal’s strained relationship with India due to border blockades by Madhesi protesters. During the border blockedes, Mr K P Sharma Oli and his corroborator Upendra Yadav made tons of money by smuggling essential goods into the country and used them to win the next election in 2015. K P Sharma Oli also used the blockeds to justify his tilt towards China stating that it is to balance India. All his life K P Sharma Oli used India to his advantage. Even during his exile days, he used to stay with his relatives in Assam’s Tamulpur district.As advised by China, K P Sharma had claimed Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura passes and also issued a new map encompassing the whole territory that is part of Uttrakhand. More importantly, China has established ideological linkages with Nepal Communist Party by establishing several China Study Centers and organizing the workshop on Xi Jinping’s ideas on the Chinese model of economic development and socialism. During Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal in 2019, bilateral relationships were transformed into strategic partners.More Stories like this3rd North East Games 2024 kickstarts with musical…Mar 19, 2024Police Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Under this partnership, many agreements, MoUs, and treaties were signed in many spheres such as transport, agriculture, and industry. Xi Jinping offered Nepalese Rupees 56 billion in assistance to Nepal for development projects. Most importantly, Nepal became a signatory to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and various projects such as Kathmandu-Kerung Railway, and Galchi-Rasuwagarhi- Kerung 400 KV transmission line. China is the highest FDI contributor to Nepal. Efforts are going on for China’s engagement in tourism, education, and culture sectors.The existing political instability in Nepal is a result of various factors such as weak socio-economic conditions, internal and external conflicts, corruption, religious and ethnic tensions, democratic accountability, weak government, the coalitional government not based upon ideology but just to win the elections, lack of transparency, and above all quality of bureaucracy of a nation. Nepal has been the victim of civil war from 1996-2006. Political instability is causing severe problems such as a lack of development that result in high unemployment, illiteracy, gender inequality, lack of education, weak investment, and extreme poverty. Moreover, Nepal’s society is bifurcated on caste lines and ongoing conflict between Hinduism and Buddhism also jeopardizes the developmental pace which, in turn, leads to political instability in Nepal.Rampant corruption that is rooted in the nexus that involves politicians, civil servants, and people in business and citizens has become an integral part of the politics of Nepal and is responsible for its deep economic crisis. Weak infrastructure, environmental degradation due to high deforestation, and lack of modernization due to the unavailability of advanced technology are the factors responsible for the current situation in Nepal.Nepal is surrounded by India from three sides and on the Northern side by Tibet which is presently under Chinese occupation. Earlier Tibet was also a buffer between India and China. But now only Nepal remains hence is of importance to India due to its strategic geographical location. Therefore, India has to keep away from Chinese influence. China is constantly influencing Nepal’s left-wing political parties by luring them in every possible way.Since the abolition of the Monarchy as an institution in Nepal, China has been interfering and trying to influence Nepal’s politics to fulfil its security, military and political ambitions. Politicians of Nepal are very keen on leveraging this China factor as was done by K P Sharma took during his reign from 2015-16. Aware of its strategic location between two adversary nations, Nepal formulates its foreign policy by keeping a balancing act as its topmost consideration in addition to territorial integrity, and stability in political and economic situations.Overtime trust deficit has widened in India-Nepal because of the Indian reputation for delaying the implementation of various projects.There is the anti-India feeling among certain ethnic groups in Nepal which emanates from the perception that India indulges too much in Nepal and tinkers with their political sovereignty.Thus India has to “review” its approach in light of the current socio, economical and political dynamics of Nepal. Because of the difficult terrain and geographical distance from China’s East coast, the destiny of Nepal is tied with India. However India could deliberate on the Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship Treaty, of 1950 by considering the needs and aspirations of the citizens of Nepal, current demands regarding maintaining its territorial integrity and security, and most importantly accord a very unique strategic place to Nepal in its foreign and national security policy to Nepal considering that China is trying to cultivate the South Asian in every possible way.Unobtrusively, India should continue supporting favourable factions in the Terai region in Nepal.Boundary disputes relating to the Kalapani River and the discrepancy in locating its source of origin have become a bone of contention between India and Nepal. The area around the Kalapani River is very crucial for India due to illegal cross- border activities and crimes originating from Nepal. Therefore, it is a very sensitive area and India must have control over it.India should consider the views, security concerns, needs and aspirations of the people, especially those residing in Madhesi regions that play a very crucial role in the domestic politics of both countries. India should avoid any activities such as the ‘Nepal Blockade’ of 2015 that gives the impression of unnecessary intervention in the domestic political affairs of Nepal. These acts give an opportunity to the politicians of Nepal for justifying tilting swiftly towards China. If such acts become necessary they must be done quietly, without any publicity so that it is conducive to political stability and social cohesion in Nepal.Nepal should also be asked to consider India’s security consideration and the growing needs of India’s economy. There is a reciprocal relationship between security and economy and both, in turn, affect the polity of a nation. The open and porous border along which five Indian states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar West Bengal, and Sikkim have located consists of many points through which terrorists and destabilization activities such as money laundering, smuggling of arms and narcotics are being run by criminals and ISI sponsored proxies & spy rings that are aiming to destabilise India in many ways. It seems that Nepal is unable to control and is continuously ignoring these anti-India activities. Nepal’s leniency is encouraging some fundamentalist and terror funding organizations from Pakistan and the Middle East to create a power bloc which is also being fueled by ISI to disrupt the Gangetic plains where India is very sensitive. More importantly, this power bloc is creating law and order problems by creating ethnic unrest in Nepal also. Nepal has to understand this critical situation which is jeopardizing the security, economy and development of both countries. By keeping aside minimal and short-term gains, Nepal has to understand how this geographical interdependence that binds India and Nepal together could be fruitful to its holistic development.India should engage more proactively with Nepal in terms of people-to-people engagement, bureaucratic engagement as well as political interactions.Nepal is about to elect Banaras Hindu University graduate Shri Ramchandra Paudel Ji as new President.

manipur-chief-minister-calls-for-an-end-to-india-myanmar-border-free-movement-regime,"Balancing security with livelihoods is essential, but in this case, the need for stringent Indo-Myanmar border control measures is paramount for the safety and well-being of the region’s citizens and the nation at large.By Kaoba AngomchaManipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh has recently made a significant call for the termination of the India-Myanmar border free movement regime and the expedited fencing of this international border. The free movement regime, which has been in place for over 70 years, allows people living in close proximity to the border on both sides to travel up to 16 kilometers into each other’s territory without requiring any documentation. Chief Minister Biren Singh’s call has sparked discussions and debates about border security, illegal immigration, and drug trafficking in Manipur.The Free Movement Regime: A Security Threat?Chief Minister Biren Singh has raised concerns that the free movement regime is being misused by “illegal immigrants” and poses a significant security threat to the region. His assertion is not without merit, as border areas often become hotspots for illegal activities, including drug and weapons smuggling including human trafficking. Manipur, in particular, is facing challenges currently related to cross-border criminal activities, and the misuse of this regime has only exacerbated the current situation of ethnic clashes.One of the key issues highlighted by Chief Minister Biren Singh is the positioning of security forces along the border. He argues that the security forces are stationed too far inside Indian territory, approximately 14-15 kilometers from the actual border. This, according to him, provides an opportunity for exploitation for illegal activities.  He proposes that security forces should be deployed at the zero point, effectively strengthening border security and minimizing unauthorized movement.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024The Central Government’s RoleChief Minister Biren Singh’s call for ending the free movement regime raises questions about the role of the Central Government in addressing border security concerns. It is indeed questionable why security forces are stationed so far inside Indian territory rather than being stationed at the border itself. This raises concerns about potential complicity of security forces in illegal activities, in addition to the statement above pointed out by Chief Minister Biren Singh.Furthermore, the decision to terminate the free movement regime should not require extensive consultation with stakeholders of the state nor an explicit permission from Chief Minister Biren Sigh’s government , as it is fundamentally a matter of national security at international borders. The primary responsibility of the government is to ensure the safety and security of the nation’s citizens, which necessitates stringent border control measures.The Need for Urgent ActionThe situation along the India-Myanmar border calls for immediate attention and action. The laxity and negligence in border security have allowed illegal immigration and drug trafficking to thrive. These issues have not only posed security risks but have also become a source of tension among various ethnic communities in Manipur.While it is essential to consider the impact on livelihoods at the border, the urgency of addressing security concerns far outweighs any potential disruptions to daily life. Ending the free movement regime and reinforcing border security will not only deter illegal activities but also promote the overall well-being of the people in Manipur.Chief Minister N Biren Singh’s call to end the India-Myanmar border free movement regime is a step in the right direction to enhance security and curb illegal activities in Manipur. The concerns raised about the misuse of the regime and the positioning of security forces are valid and require immediate attention from the Central Government. Balancing security with livelihoods is essential, but in this case, the need for stringent border control measures is paramount for the safety and well-being of the region’s residents and the nation at large."

examining-allegations-of-assam-rifles-involvement-in-drug-trade-with-kuki-militants-role-of-the-home-ministry,"It is the duty of every citizen to demand accountability and transparency from our government and security forces. The allegations against the Assam Rifles and the Home Ministry demand a swift and thorough investigation to uphold the principles of justice and integrity in our nation. Let us unite in calling for an unbiased inquiry into these grave accusations to ensure that truth prevails.By Thangjanganba LuwangRecent allegations implicating the Assam Rifles (AR) in drug trade activities with Kuki militants in Manipur have raised serious concerns about the integrity of our security forces and government institutions. These allegations are of grave concern and necessitate immediate attention and a thorough investigation. Notably, the Assam Rifles fall under the direct purview of the Home Ministry of the Government of India, including areas designated as “Disturbed Areas” under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA).AllegationsThe allegations against the Assam Rifles are substantial and merit a comprehensive examination. Some of the specific accusations include:Kuki Militants’ Protection:Among the most severe allegations is that the AR is affording protection to Kuki militants involved in drug trafficking. This claim finds support in an FIR filed by the Manipur Police, which alleges that the AR assisted Kuki militants in evading arrest by providing them safe passage through their checkpoints.Facilitation of Drug Movement:There are also allegations that the AR facilitates the movement of drugs through its checkpoints. This is made possible by the AR’s substantial presence in Manipur, which shares a border with Myanmar, a major source of narcotics. Indications suggest that the AR may be overlooking the drug movement through these checkpoints.Bribery and Corruption:Another serious accusation is that the AR is accepting bribes from Kuki militants in exchange for protection and collaboration in drug-related activities. If true, this accusation would severely compromise the AR’s integrity.Negligence by Home Ministry:The Home Ministry is accused of turning a blind eye to the AR’s involvement in drug trafficking. This allegation raises questions about the government’s commitment to addressing drug-related issues.EvidenceThese allegations are not unsubstantiated and are supported by a series of troubling incidents and reports:FIR Against AR:In February and April 2023, the Manipur Police filed FIRs against the AR, accusing them of aiding the escape of arrested Kuki militants. This is a critical allegation, as it implies that the AR may be deliberately undermining the state’s efforts to combat militancy in Manipur.Media Reports:Multiple media outlets have published articles suggesting the involvement of Kuki drug lords in the peace process in Manipur. These reports indicate that certain Kuki militants may be exploiting the peace process to continue their involvement in drug trafficking and other illicit activities.Growing Rift:Reports highlight a growing rift between the AR and the Manipur Police, with both sides accusing each other of corruption and human rights abuses. This discord could undermine the effectiveness of security operations in Manipur.Public Demands:The Coordination Committee of Manipur Indigenous Insurgents (COCOMI) has demanded the removal of the AR from Manipur. This demand reflects increasing concerns among the local population regarding the AR’s role in Manipur.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024ConclusionConsidering the mounting evidence and the gravity of these allegations, an immediate and impartial investigation is imperative. These allegations cast a shadow over the reputation of our security forces and the Home Ministry and must be taken with the utmost seriousness.RecommendationsIn light of these allegations, we propose the following recommendations:Independent Investigation:The Home Ministry should commission an impartial investigation into the allegations against the Assam Rifles (AR) and the Home Ministry itself. This investigation should be conducted by a neutral entity, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to ensure transparency and fairness.Neutral Body:The CBI, India’s premier investigating agency with a proven track record of impartial investigations, is the ideal choice to lead this inquiry.Transparency:The investigation’s findings should be made public to maintain trust in our institutions. The public has a right to know the truth regarding these serious allegations.Preventive Measures:The Home Ministry should proactively implement measures to prevent any involvement of the AR in drug trafficking or other criminal activities in Manipur. This includes strengthening oversight mechanisms and implementing stricter accountability measures.Call to ActionEstablish a Special Task Force:The Home Ministry should establish a dedicated task force to investigate all allegations of drug trafficking and corruption in Manipur. This task force should operate independently of the AR and possess the authority to investigate all levels of the security establishment.Review AR’s Role:The Home Ministry should reassess the AR’s role in Manipur and evaluate whether it is necessary for the AR to maintain such a significant presence in the state. Given the AR’s history of human rights abuses in Manipur, it is possible that its involvement has created an environment conducive to drug trafficking and corruption.Collaborative Strategy:The Home Ministry should collaborate with the Manipur government to develop a comprehensive strategy to combat drug trafficking and corruption in the state. This strategy should encompass addressing the root causes of drug addiction and rehabilitating drug users.It is the duty of every citizen to demand accountability and transparency from our government and security forces. The allegations against the AR and the Home Ministry demand a swift and thorough investigation to uphold the principles of justice and integrity in our nation. Let us unite in calling for an unbiased inquiry into these grave accusations to ensure that truth prevails.Links for References below:Source 1Source 2Source 3Source 4Source 5Source 6Source 7"
timeless-memories,"This pandemic gave me eyes to find beauty in everything and also helped me to bring out my hidden potential. My love for gardening, photography and closeness to nature have blossomed during this time. This was a blessing in disguise for me. Besides a good diet and lifestyle, happiness is a vital part of being healthy. Having a hobby gives you happiness and adds quality to your life.By Durga MukhiaAs I open my window to enjoy the morning sunrise, my thoughts reach out far away to my childhood days. It starts reflecting on the long-lost memories that flood in wave after wave. I can remember our house with the bedroom windows being opened to let the fresh air from where one can enjoy the splendor of morning sunrise. The golden touch of the sun rays on every flower seemed so heavenly which has left an indelible impression on my mind.Thesweet and warm smell of sweet peas, carnation, freesia, magnolia, and jasmine will never part from me. They are still lingering around me with everlasting freshness. I remember the soft whistling of the breeze with the sweet smell of flowers and fruits. I still remember vividly how I would help my mother and sisters to fill the vases with aromatic flowers in the house. My childhood revolved around flowers like a garland of memories. There is beauty in the memories of warm spring days and it reminds me of my family growing up together, playing together in the field covered with daisies and lilies. I grew up in Kalimpong, a beautiful town which is situated in the eastern Himalayas in the altitude of 1300-1500 m above sea level. Kalimpong is also known as second Holland. The influence of climatic conditions for growth and flowering is best experienced here. Unless one can visit and stay there, they will not understand the meaning of the town’s peace and tranquillity. It is Home to flowers and similarly my heart became home to flowers.I regard myself lucky to be in Tea as a Planter’s wife where I could connect myself with gardening. I got ample time to grow, care, nurture and look after flowers that allowed me to express and bring out the beauty in front of me. I took every opportunity to make my garden look absolutely fabulous with its profusion of flowers, herbs, shrubs and trees which beautify the surroundings and infuse health in the body and mind by their cheerful effect. My heart bloomed with happiness during the flowering season.Thelast one and a half years have been difficult for all the people in the world. We all are cooped up with families for a long period of time within four walls. I tried to make best use of this adverse time in immersing myself in hobbies like gardening and photography which gave me profound happiness. Flower was an inspiration for me to embrace photography as a new hobby. I produced plenty of photos in a very artistic, visual, and creative way and started sharing with friends and loved ones. I received appreciation which boosted my inner strength. Then I realized there were no boundaries on the direct path of doing what you love to do, and sooner or later your talent will see the world. In this era of internet, posting and sharing of photos have become a great source of recreation. Everyone likes to take pride of their photography.More Stories like thisKaleidoscope journey of veteran artist: Life and times of…Jan 16, 2023Nihilism Is Not and Cannot Be the Principle of Governance:…Jan 8, 2023Millions Of Children Will Soon Need Aadhaar IDs To Access…Jun 30, 2022The smallest lens acts as a portal which can show us the images of the whole world. Holding a powerful smartphone in my hand, I unlocked the ability to capture stunning photos wherever I go. Anyone with a camera can be called a photographer but it takes persistent practice and interest to acquire skill in any field. My passion for skill in producing high quality photographs grew. Snapping each different flower in the morning had become a ritual. I found photography to be very inspiring which prompted me to go outdoors more often that helped me to explore and connect with nature, my New World. My family accompanied me for morning and evening walks with great enthusiasm. It made them sensitive to our nature and environment. It’s important to teach our children to see and love the flowers, the trees, the birds, the butterflies, yes, Nature. It helps in restoring balance to save the mankind from the impending catastrophe.A charming atmosphere elevates the human soul above the daily drudgery of this world, guides it towards the pleasant unknown.Spending time with nature in capturing outdoor shots of widespread paddy fields, rolling hills of luscious greenery to acres of beautifully manicured tea bushes spreading over the countryside was so delightful. I found so much peace in my new world. I experienced abundance of knowledge and endless teachings. I learned that every aspect of nature has something worth learning for everyone.Even a small creature like butterfly taught me valuable lessons. The butterfly is a fragile creature which has a long journey of struggles which starts from it coming out of it’s cocoon till turning into a beautiful life, filling the world with colours. It taught me that within you is the power to rise above any situation or struggle and transform into the Brightest and Strongest version of You Ever. I got the opportunity to learn from nature through its various forms. Each season has its own message for us, and that change is the only constant in life. I enjoy sunny summer with the warmth and liveliness, the monsoon with it’s natural spring, water bodies and waterfalls, the chillness of winter, blossoms of spring and nostalgic feeling of the autumn.Thispandemic gave me eyes to find beauty in everything and also helped me to bring out my hidden potential. My love for gardening, photography and closeness to nature have blossomed during this time. This was a blessing in disguise for me. Besides a good diet and lifestyle, happiness is a vital part of being healthy. Having a hobby gives you happiness and adds quality to your life.Everyphoto that I have captured through the lens has an emotion attached which I wish to treasure and recall in later part of my life. It has brought a transformation in my life, my thoughts and actions and filled my heart with purity. The joy of spending morning time in taking photos of nature is a blissful experience. During this time of dawn, the body is refreshed after sleep and the peregrinations of daytime will not yet have been imprinted on you. Flowers seem to be meditating to welcome the gracious emergence of glowing sun, the light of all life. The early morning silence punctuated by the shrill notes of various creatures and melody of birds are glorious. Those who follow the law of nature enjoys the real essence of life, which illumines all the senses, thereby adding more quality and age to your life. My passion and love for flowers led me to healthy and life-long hobbies like gardening and photography which eventually introduced me to Nature, a wonderful gift from GOD.(Durga Mukhia was Born and brought up in Kalimpong but now residing in Silchar, Assam.

Despite their presence, the killing of civilians have not stopped till date, says YFPHR.TFM DeskYouth’s Forum for Protection of Human Rights (YFPHR) said it strongly believed that all the killing of civilians and attack on unarmed civilians in Manipur are taking place right under the nose of over 60,000 central forces who are deployed to contain the ethnic violence unleashed by Kuki Militants.YFPHR in a press note issued by secretary T Shadishkanta, also gave the details of prominent attacks as follows stating that these attacks took place “right in front” of central forces who are deployed to curb the violence.1. On the 05/08/2023, three unarmed civilians villagers, including a father and a son, were brutally murdered in cold blood by Kuki militants at Kwakta Lamkhai Ward No VIII, Bishnupur district under the nose of the Assam Rifles posted to prevent the violence.2. On the 08/09/2023, a 15-year-old girl was injured when Kuki militants indiscriminately fired at the village in Koutruk. The militants reportedly launched the attack from three sides atop Koutruk Hill.

This clearly indicates that the Central Forces are in nexus with the Kuki Militants under strict guidance of the Government of India to continue the violence in Manipur having their economic interest”, alleges YFPHR.YFPHR has asked the Government of India to respect the “Indigenous Peoples’ Right to Life and Self Determination; Stop the killing of civilians immediately and punish the killers; Withdraw Central Armed Forces from Manipur and Stop Militarisation”.FOR ALL UPDATES AND LATEST PLEASE, FOLLOW TFM SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMShttps://www.facebook.com/TheFrontierManipur/"
invasion-of-invasive-species-view-from-climate-change-perspectives,"In Manipur’s context, things are yet to happen in earnest on understanding the menace and influence of invasive species on the local biodiversity and in the long term process that which would impact the livelihood of the rural population particularlyBy Salam RajeshThere are many issues challenging the world community in contemporary times from the perspective of an enfolding environmental crisis with debates and intensive discussions on Climate Change processes and impacts doing the rounds across the globe at different levels and platforms, and on various subject matters.A wide range of hot topics from glacial melts to sea level rise to biodiversity loss (and damages) to extreme weather events and to food and water insecurity are on the menu, and these are knitted closely on the intricacies of changing climatic conditions globally that reportedly has been hastened by undesired human activities on a global scale.One of the fundamental discussions is on biodiversity loss due to reasons like large-scale exploitation of forest and water resources for human commercial purposes, leaving massive mountain landscapes bare to the root and vital tropical rainforests charred and desolate, and wetlands steadily losing out to reclamation for human settlement, farming, urbanization, and industrial expansion.In all of these discussions, one aspect that is less discussed in remote areas like Manipur in India’s far east but which is essentially located within one of the world’s top biological hotspots is the invasion of invasive alien species of plants, fish, insects and other life forms, and how the domination of invasive plant species over land and waterbodies could possibly be contributing to greenhouse gas emission and other process linked to global warming and climate change.Climate change deliberation is basically looked at from two perspectives, one, that which occurs naturally (nature-induced climate change) and two, that which is influenced by human activities (human-induced climate change). For the layman, it is the latter that is most concerned in the current climate change scenario.In 2022, the European Union in its parliamentary debates had rounds of earnest discussions on invasive alien species and it came up with a huge list of invasive species of European Union concern. The massive list mentions as many as 6,368 species of invasive terrestrial plants and around 4,682 species of invasive animals that are reportedly of serious concern to all of the countries in Europe.At this scale, the amount of invasive alien plant species dominating the landscapes and causing massive biodiversity loss, particularly leading to the decline of native species of food and fodder value, overshadows the prospect of thriving and degrading vegetation in large volume contributing to greenhouse gas emission – which, of course, is the core of climate change related concern.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in its publication “Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and their Control (2023)” states that, ‘When imported species run rampant and unbalance local ecosystems, indigenous biodiversity suffers’. The IPBES report further identified 3500 invasive species that are reported to be severely harming biodiversity and human livelihoods across the globe and that unless corrective measures are taken up post-haste these invasive species would multiply rapidly, with a forecast increase of 36 percent by the year 2050.In Manipur’s context, things are yet to happen in earnest on understanding the menace and influence of invasive species on the local biodiversity and in the long term process that which would impact the livelihood of the rural population particularly. Biodiversity loss as interpreted with the loss of important food and medicinal plants available locally and which provide food, nutrition and local medicinal uses could lead to dependency on outside, or imported, foods and a change in nutritional diet and traditional food habits. It could also impact the earning capability of the local people who source food plants from the wild to earn their living.In view of the emerging concerns at both the national and global scale on the issue of the invasion of invasive alien species and their control, the State’s Directorate of Environment and Climate Change initiated talks at the local level on the 20th of this month to understand how people at large perceive the threat and either are engaging in the subject or are yet to take root earnestly.In early 2022, the Chennai-based National Biodiversity Authority brought out a report on the Invasive Alien Species of India listing several plants, fishes, animals, insects, and microbes that are invasive in nature, and sought opinions on their control and removal by the target year 2030.On a similar footing, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2023) in its Key Finding 9 observed that, ‘As Climate Change threatens all countries, communities and people around the world, increased adaptation action as well as enhanced efforts to avert, minimize and address loss and damage are urgently needed to reduce and respond to increasing impacts’.Dealing on the subject matter, Target 4 of the Ramsar Convention’s 4th Strategic Plan 2016-2024 clearly emphasized that ‘Invasive Alien Species and pathways of introduction and expansion are identified and prioritized, priority invasive alien species are controlled or eradicated, and management responses are prepared and implemented to prevent their introduction and establishment’.This recommendation runs parallel to the (earlier) Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 which had recommended that ‘By 2020, Invasive Alien Species and the pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled and eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment’.The concern at the global platform reflects the urgency in which the subject matter on invasive alien species impacting local biodiversity and leading to a series of other related issues including the decline in native plant and fish species of food value, and consequently inducing food insecurity as well as in contributing to GHG emission from the accumulation of large volume of degraded vegetation matter, is becoming a leading topic in global environmental deliberation.Manipur presently is seeing an uncontrolled increase in the (intentional) introduction of imported ornamental and commercial fish species such as the Northern African Sharptooth CatfishClaria gariepinus(native to North Africa), Blue PanchaxAplocheilus panchax(native to southern Asia), Amazon Sailfin CatfishPterygoplichthys pardalis(native to the Amazon River Basin in Brazil and Peru), Red-bellied PacuPiaractus brachypomus(native to South America particularly the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, and which is related to the Red-bellied Piranha).The prospect of these introduced fish species ultimately becoming invasive alien fishes in the waters of the Manipur River Basin can become an additional headache to the already confusing matter in hand with the existing invasive plant and fish species that are reportedly influencing the decline of native plant and fish species of food value. Quarantine units are not in place to check such undesired introductions and there is apparently a lack of serious concern on the matter by relevant Government agencies.This is where the round-table conference on Invasive Alien Species initiated by the Directorate of Environment last week becomes critical for the State to prevent further inroad and expansion of the invasive plant, fish, animal, and insect species to prevent biodiversity loss on the one hand while addressing livelihoods, health and climate-related concerns on the other hand. Experts attending the conference unanimously addressed the concern of having a responsible authority of the State which can tackle the issue on the ground both from the scientific and empirical perspectives."

ethnic-violence-in-manipur-is-product-if-strategic-collusion-between-kuki-militants-illegal-immigrants-and-drug-cartel,"Issued By Manipur Meitei Association, Bangalore (MMAB) & World Meetei Council (WMC)Various narratives from both ends explaining the trigger behind the most recent altercation between Meitei and Kuki are largely accusatory in nature. That said, it is important to look at the history and demography of Manipur in order to properly understand the long-running internal strife, the tribal communities’ vigorous resistance to Meitei demand for ST designation and the eruption of the ethnic violence currently taking place.Manipur is a state in the Northeast of India which was granted its statehood on the 21st of January 1972. Earlier, it was under Union Territory after passing the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganization) Act, 1971. It spans a total area of 22,327 square km and as per the 2011 Census (Manipur Population Census 2011, Manipur Religion, Literacy, Sex Ratio – Census India), the population of the state was estimated at 28.56 lakhs (roughly 2.87 million), whereas the distribution between Hindus and Christians, to be about 41% each. According to available source, the population of Manipur is currently 31.94 lakhs (roughly 3.2 million) as of 2022. There are 33 recognized tribes considered indigenous peoples of Manipur. To be more specific, many of these ethnic sub-tribal communities identify as either Kuki or Naga; in essence, there is no actual homogenous tribe community known as Kuki or Naga. Meiteis (mainly Hindu tribes) reside in the Imphal valley which accounts for approximately 9% of the total area while Christian tribes (mainly Kuki and Naga) reside in the Hill areas. There is no land protection for Meiteis of this meagre 9%of Manipur’s overall land mass, known as the Imphal valley, which is shared by a variety of different ethnic tribes, including Muslim, as well as other non-Manipuri communities like the Marwaris, Punjabi, Bengali etc.However, none of these groups, including the Meiteis, are permitted to live in Hill areas. Moreover, once a land has been purchased and owned by tribal members in the Valley area, repurchasing and reacquiring said land from a tribal communitymember is an exceedingly challenging and laborious endeavor as it is protected under a special Provision regarding Schedule Tribes. Bear in mind that these numerous disadvantages faced by indigenous Meiteis to own land in their native state–largely due to this inequitable bifurcation of hill-valley laws – come in spite of the entirety of the state of Manipur state being classified as a Hill state, much like Srinagar, a valley in Jammu and Kashmir. This is following the 1965 Planning Commission, where states in India are categorized as Hill States and States with Hill areas.The tribal communities who are protected by the constitution article 371 strongly oppose the Meitei receiving the ST status contending that they are already privileged elite Hindus, and may infringe on their rights to their share of the reservations and thus encroach their lands. Manipuri or Meitei Lon has historically been employed as a language of trade as the Meitei have traditionally controlled the Imphal valley, which served primarily as a hub for commerce and economic activity. As this is also the official language in Manipur, it seems to be a source of shared grievance among the tribal communities that there is a certain bias towards a single community – this argument needs to be reconsidered in those terms.On the other hand, the Meitei maintain that this demand for inclusion has nothing to do with other tribes as it has been a long-standing demand that, for decades, has fallen on deaf ears and largely ignored by all governments. For their part, the Meitei contend that because of their marginalization, being socially and economically underdeveloped, they are entitled to the constitutional protection of their rich culture and heritage which would otherwise be at risk of being lost and feel that requesting the ST status is not only justified but becoming increasingly urgent.The Imphal Valley population is very diverse and reflects its multicultural and multi-ethnic makeup. In recent years, the fervor of the ST demand has been reignited with the train set to connect Manipur to the rest of the country. The indigenous Meiteis, both those adhering to Hinduism and those following the ancient faith of Sanamahism have been safeguarding their culture and heritage, preserving sacred groves, and worshipping their native gods and goddesses for countless generations. Despite the adoption of Hinduism, Meitei Hindus have a long and steadfast tradition of performing indigenous Meiteirituals – every household has a designated corner for the “Lainingthou” (supreme God) and every locality possesses a sacred deity who watches over the sacred grove where yearly celebrations of the “Laiharaoba” take place in every neighborhood. Moreover, the majority of the tribal population is Christian, a religion introduced by European missionaries in the late 19th century.While they are also protecting their lands and traditions, much of it has been lost after the adoption of Christianity as the religion does not permit dual worship or the observance of non-Christian traditions. It is important to note that the granting of the ST status is a constitutional matter that requires a thorough examination of the socio-economic and cultural characteristics of the community. The decision to grant or reject the Meiteis’ demand for the ST designation ultimatelyrests with the Central government based on the recommendations of the committee.In order to postulate the possibility of a common resentment toward the Meitei from these communities, particularly the Kuki, it is important to understand their narratives. The Kuki population in Manipur is estimated at 4.7 lakhs as per the 2011 census and 9.26 lakhs according to open source. If we trace the history, the Kuki immigration to Manipur began during the colonial period when the British established the Chin Hills as a separate district in 1892. The Kukis, who were then living in the Chin Hills, were displaced and pushed towards Manipur, where they settled in the Churachandpur district. The Kukis also migrated to Manipur during the Second World War, when they were recruited by the British to fight against the Japanese. In recent years, the Kukis from Myanmar have been crossing the border illegally and settling in Manipur due to various socio-political and economic reasons. Because of the government of India’s absence on policies concerning refugee resettlement along with the close ethnic ties between Manipuri Kuki and Chin Kuki from Myanmar, they are able to cross over undetected and easily blend in. This is the primary concern of the government of Manipur and as such, have been in serious discussion to implement a National Register of Citizens (NRC), a register of Indian citizens in order to identify illegal immigrants.The NRC was first implemented in the state of Assam. Implementation of the NRC comes with many challenges including strong opposition, especially from the Kuki community, given their history and recent immigration. It should be noted that the NRC is a complex process that involves extensive documentation and verification, and its implementation requires significant resources and manpower.The population growth since 2001 is recorded at 24.5%, while the population of Meiteis has remained constant. The population of the Kuki in particular, has seen the most significant growth, subsequently changing the entire demographic of the state. In one study, it was found that over the decade, the Kuki-Chin population has increased by almost 230%, primarily due to the illegal immigration of Kuki-Chin into the territory. Local sources state that this growth is mainly found in five districts nearing Myanmar, namely, Churachandpur, Pherzawl, Chandel (bordering town of Moreh), Tengnoupal (enroute to Moreh) and Kangpokpi. These illegal Kuki immigrants, illegally settled in reserved forested lands, have been primarily involved in poppy plantation with the support of drug cartels and have long been demanding an Independent Kuki Homeland.For the most part, Meitei and Kuki have generally always coexisted peacefully as evidenced during the 1993 Kuki and Naga conflict, where the Meitei provided shelter and safe haven to thousands of Kuki. The matter in question concerns the illegal Kuki-Chin immigrants from Myanmar, who are involved in militancy, drugs and poppy cultivation.• The total Kuki population in Manipur as per 2011 census was 4,67,854. Recent estimates place the Kuki population at ~ 30% of the total Manipur population, which converts to ~ 9 lakhs.• Instead, if we project the Kuki population for 2022 using the 2021 Manipur birth rate of 13.3, thisyields ~ 5.4 lakh.• Even a conservative estimate shows an abnormal excess population of 2-3 lakhs. This abnormality can only be attributed to illegal immigration.Another point of contention is Poppy cultivation as a means of livelihood. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact areas of poppy cultivation in Manipur as most of it is taking place in remote and inaccessible areas, and much of it is being done illegally. However, according to the Narcotics Control Bureau, poppy cultivation in Manipur covers an estimated area of around 16,000 hectares, with the districts of Chandel, Ukhrul, and Churachandpur being the most affected.The government is fighting a war on drugs and the state police have been cracking down on poppy cultivation, with those caught being punished under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Eviction drives in the reserved forests in the wake of frequent forest fires and global climate change including droughts in Manipur have been adopted by the government after a long lapse of its own machinery. This sudden drive is predominantly affecting the forest dwellers, immigrants comprised of mostly Kukis who are strongly opposed, among other tribes or communities. The Kuki believe that it is not the prerogative of the Government and instead a tactic by the Meiteicommunity’s majority to claim their land.More Stories like thisYUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022YOONGOU LITRE 250 ROM PHAGATTUNA MANGHANKHRESep 4, 2022Another common point of discontent among the tribals is the hill-valley division in the legislature being dominated by Meitei as Chief Ministers excluding Yangmaso Shaiza and Reshang Keishing (12 yrs.). Currently, out of 60 MLAs, 40 serve the Imphal valley whereas just over 20 are reserved for tribals in the hills. However, since Manipur acquired its full statehood in 1972, this representation has been based purely on the size of the population. This needs to be reviewed in more detail which is why it is imperative to conduct the NRC. The valley has most facilities as it happens to be the capital and home to most ethnicities, thus the economic capital. This pattern of the capital always being wealthier and more affluent than the distant areas, together with significant gaps in both government efficiency and investment prospects, has persisted throughout history. Because of a markedly uneven and unbalanced division of policies between the hill and the valley, there is no consensus amongst government officials on how to deal with the reservation norms and merits of not only the Meiteis who are classified as general or OBC (Other Backward Classes), but of all ethnicities –entitlements such as ST or OBC are designations meant to uplift and provide aid to the underprivileged portions of society rather than lifelong entitlement badges to be taken advantage of which is a persisting issue. Due to a substantial lack of transparency regulating the public sphere, there is a systemic failure in the functioning of the government that consistently puts the dominant community in Imphal at a social and economic disadvantage time and again. The hill areas are administered at the district level by theAutonomous district council, empowered to maintain and manage property: movable and immovable, and institutions under their jurisdiction except reserved forests. At the state level, the Hill areas committee that includes the MLA of these areas, oversee the planning, implementation and monitoring of all development activities in these areas. If the Hill areas are a genuine casualty of underdevelopment, then the implementation of proper reforms and the amendment of inadequate policies should be reviewed in priority in order to bring more transparency and effective management within governing bodies and help connect with and efficiently serve the people from all areas, objectively, and without bias to any one group – irrespective of the hill-valley divide.A high-level committee led by the department of tribal affairs; Manipur earlier has recommended moving away from the hill-valley fund allocation system to a tribal sub-plan system. This is because the current system does not accurately capture the actual fund allocation and expenditure for the hill districts. Currently, a number of projects from the valley allocations benefithill areas or both, such as the Tribal Research Institute, Hill Village Chiefs Guest House, Manipur Secretariat, Inter-State Bus and Truck Terminus, among others. It is also worth mentioning here that the percentage of expenditure in hill areas has increased over the years, as reflected in the figures of 33.8% (2016-2017) and 45.75% (2020-21). The main flaws were delays and lack of precise census data for an extensive period as well as the hill-valley division of the budget.Some developments and significant initiatives taken by the current BJP Government in Manipur led by Chief Minister Shri N. Biren Singh1. Drug trafficking is a major transnational organized crime with the potential to undermine national security. India’s proximity to the Golden Triangle is being misused by criminals for their nefarious activities and the cases has been on rise over the period. The current government has been engaged in an aggressive anti-drug campaign and as such,dismantled many poppy plantations. This, in turn, significantly impacted the poppy and drug business supply chains of the notorious Golden Triangle route.

The current Government of Manipur has initiated aggressive drives against illegal encroachment across the state and not just in Kuki dominated areas.

Centre’s approval required to introduce NRC in Manipur: CM Biren Singh – The Hindu Centre’s approval required toimplement NRC, says Manipur CM (sakshipost.com)5. More recently, the Manipur High Court Order dated March 27, 2023 directing the Minister of Tribal Affairs, GoI (first respondent) to consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list –expeditiously, and preferably within a period of four weeks from the date of reception of a copy of the order in terms ofthe averments set out in the written petition and in line with the order passed in WP(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court– was a matter of contention.Although the above initiatives were in favor of furthering the state’s development, unfortunately, they came into conflict with the demand of an Independent Kuki Homeland by Kuki militants and illegal migrants as well as significantly impacted the poppy plantation business run by the drug cartels and illegal Kuki-chin immigrants. Multiple Kuki Organizations, Militant groups and affected drug cartels took this opportunity to instigate the Kuki population against the government andplanned for a retaliation which was further prompted by the emotional outcry following the encroachment drive at K Songjang village and the High Order on the Meteis ST demand.1. April 27: A Day before Biren Singh’s visit to Churachandpur, the open gym the chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate was set on fire.2. April 28: Section 144 was imposed along with a five-day suspension of internet services. Protesters and security forces clashed, with police resorting to the use of tear gas shells to disperse the mob in the district of Churachandpur.According to sources, police forces were not removed from the district despite the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF) agreeing to withdraw the protest. A mob gathered in the Tuibong Bazar area resorted to burning tires on the roads.3. May 3: Thousands turned up for the Tribal Solidarity March called by the All-Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) to protest against the inclusion of Meiteis in the ST category. The rally was held across all districts in Manipur and all were relatively peaceful except in Churachandpur. More than 60,000 people were estimated to have attended the rally in Churachandpur. Violence erupted during the rally in the Torbung area –a village towards Moirang– of Churachandpur. Simultaneous violence also broke out in Moreh, a town bordering Myanmar with a sizable Meitei population, where entire shops and houses of the latter community were burned.It appears that Kukis had been planning for it after some of the initiative taken up by Government well in advance, mobilizing resources and people. Thousands of participants were seen carrying sophisticated automatic weapons in full combat gear in the so-called “peace rally”.This leaves no doubt that this was a premediated, deliberate and well-planned act. The Kuki alleged that during the peace rally, Meitei vandals set fire to the Anglo Kuki War Centenary Gate, a monument with historical significance to the Kuki, and in retaliation the Kuki responded with arson, destruction of property and burning Meitei villages and settlements in Kukidominated areas.The Meitei reported that Kuki militants, illegal immigrants and Kuki wrongdoers set flame to many Meitei houses in Kuki dominated areas where people resorted to fleeing their homes amidst the destruction. An unfortunate casualty of these arson attacks was the death of a 2-year-old infant. Purportedly, a viral video regrettably triggered arson and vandalism in Meitei dominated areas. For the purpose of peaceful coexistence, the exact cause of this trigger begs a proper investigation with reliable figures and hard facts to get to the bottom of it.After news of these hostilities broke out, there was retaliation in Imphal valley in late evening leading to full-fledged communal violence in some areas. Reports of burning Kuki properties and their respective places of worship came in as well. In response, armed with sophisticated automatic weapons, Kuki militant and miscreant groups further attacked Meitei settlements in the Hill and Kuki dominated areas. To defend themselves, Meiteis reportedly armed themselves withclubs and sticks, some even gathering firearms from Police stations as they were left alone to protect their children and families. As Meitei’s and protesters (tribals) clashed on the streets, state security forces rushed to the scene and prohibitory orders were imposed in eight districts.Officials state the death toll in this rash of brutal ethnic violence currently engulfing Manipur has reached 66. Unofficial sources placed the figure at a much higher number in the neighborhood of 200 -250 dead and more than 150 injured. More than 70,000 families have been displaced. More than 1700 Meitei homes were ravaged by fire and displaced Meiteis were placed in Relief Camps with limited resources and no proper access to food or water. There are about 76 Relief campsset up for the displaced Meitei families and a further 10 Kuki relief camps in various parts of Manipur. Many places of worship from both communities were lost to vandalism. All Meitei Hindu places of worship in 5 districts dominated by Kuki, including the Hindu Lord Shiva temple at Koubru Leikha, Konthok Leirenbi temple at Moreh, Pakhangba Leishang, Ibudhou Thangjing Koirellai, Emorok Mahadeva mandir (Shiva Mandir) were also sabotaged by arson. All these places of worship are very sacred with significant historical background standing for millennium.In the deliberate arson attack, all Meitei home temples – situated in the courtyard, an equally sacred sanctuary worshipped in the home of every Meitei household and vital to the identity of all Meiteis– were destroyed. Some of Kuki Churches which was destroyed as per the report are New Checkon Church, Kuki Baptist Church, Zou Presbyterian Church. Two churches torched as fresh violence erupts in Manipur – Matters India. Please note there was also a demolition of three illegal construction of Churches by the Government prior the outbreak of communal Violence.As far as the Kuki are concerned, the impacted area being limited to the Imphal valley was more or less contained, however, no news has mentioned the delay in reaching the Meitei civilians who were greatly affected in the hill areas. While the media is covering the communal violence, the heart of the crisis lies in the foothills and Hill areas in the five Kuki-dominated districts of Manipur where there are remains of destroyed Meitei settlements. Security forces are finding extremelychallenging to conduct a proper recue to evacuate the people most affected as heavy firing by Kuki militants continues from all sides with no viable escape route for safe relocation. There are alarming reports of a certain militant group controlling the peripheral areas of Manipur and the Imphal valley, and said to be blocking national highways and stopping essential supplies from reaching Imphal. Unfortunately, not a single media organization is covering this pressing issue due to lack of access and communication. There are multiple narratives and all these need to be thoroughly investigated by an independent body to demystify the truth.On a positive note, amidst this communal clash, there are multiple reports of Kuki giving shelter to Meitei in the Hill areas as well as Meitei giving shelter to Kuki in the Valley area. Regardless of which side is right or wrong, not all are complicit in the violence. This is a message we can all learn from and need to spread in these dire times, of peace, compassion and humanity.From examining the sequence of events, one can conclude that the issue has nothing to do with religion or Hindus and Christians. The conflict is between two communities, Meitei and Kuki. In addition, certain Kuki Militants and Kuki-chin groups who have been significantly impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives and policies put forward by the Manipur Government set off this chain of premeditated attacks and instigated the innocent Kuki public into acts of vandalism andviolence. The Judgement passed by the Manipur High Court is a legitimate order that considers the legitimacy of the Meitei to be recognized for the ST status as per the Indian Constitution, and any disagreement would have to be taken to and challenged in a Higher Court or in the Supreme Court of India, as per the Law. No reason can justify attacks on civilians, the burning of villages nor the killing of innocent people. This conflict is not about religion or one group being more privileged than the other, it is about certain novel and more hostile elements of the Kuki diaspora – namely militant outsiders and illegal immigrants – wanting to keep benefitting from protective laws that do not apply to them in the first place, being non-native to Manipur. In short, this resulting crisis is the coalescence of Kuki militants and illegal Kuki-chin immigrants demanding an Independent Kuki Homeland compounded by the Kuki feeling threatened from being excludedand discounted from the narrative with emerging new laws.That being said, some critical questions need to be addressed and answered:1. Why permission was given for the massive “peace rally” arranged by the Kuki-chin while continuous violence was on going and why the Government removed Section 144 which was already enforce prior to the peace rally2. Under what circumstances the permission was given and why no adequate security arrangements were made and for the rally.3. Why the Manipur Commando team was withdrawn on May 2nd 2023, the day before the Rally.4. How the State Police failed us so thoroughly in this matter, and who is responsible for the loss of innocent lives.5. How were armed Kuki militants and miscreants permitted to carry sophisticated automatic weapons in the open public. Has Manipur fallen under Taliban rule? The most important matter the Government needs to resolve is the issue related to illegal Kuki immigrants and the rise of Kuki militants (KRA, ZRA, KNA) and any underground Organization. Law andOrder has to be established here. This should be the prime focus for the State and Central Government.The Government should take up firm and punishable legal measures against all the perpetrators in order to restore the people’s belief and trust in the laws of the land. The issue should beinvestigated by independent agencies like NIA/CBI directly under Retd. Supreme Court Judge. Thankfully, the Central Government has now intervened to protect Manipur from Internal and External aggression by Kuki Militant groups and illegal armed immigrants. Adequate central forces have arrived to curb the violence and restore Law and Order in the State of Manipur.(Written by Manipur Meitei Association, Bangalore (MMAB) & World Meetei Council (WMC)"
dhanamanjuri-university-online-examination-is-not-unfair-but-a-must,"To be fair, we students are not demanding promotions but instead we are ready for the online examinations. Provide us tough questions and we will do our best to give correct answers.By Marjing MayanglambamIt was not long ago when online classes got discontinued and physical classes started. Most of the syllabuses were covered through online classes, and to be factual, few of them are still not covered thoroughly by the teachers either in offline or online mode.Let us ask the question of fairness when it comes to examinations. When you are taught most of the lessons in online classes, will you not expect your examinations be held in online mode too? This is a very simple understanding and a child can even understand it easily without a fuss. But, our respected Dhanamanjuri University’s higher authorities, such as the VC and Registrar are considering offline mode of examinations. Where is their sense of logic? They should at least have the common sense that their decisions are not fair and illogical.More Stories like thisMSACS ki warol laibak thibaniMar 8, 2023YUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022To be fair, we students are not demanding promotions but instead we are ready for the online examinations.

We want to be fair, and want to appear our examinations online just as our juniors (undergraduates) did. Also, our academic timeline is late, and we are lagging behind when compared to other universities. This may affect our academic journey in the future, so let the examinations be held soon in online mode.Here’s our demand which we would like to request the DMU administrative:Conduct the upcoming PG 1st and 3rd Semester Examinations in Online Mode.Conduct the above mentioned examinations as soon as possible.When these demands are met, the ongoing fight between the university authorities and the students will surely come to an end.(Marjing Mayanglambam is an anthropology postgraduate student of DMU)"

They were shot by state security forces in a passing armoured car reportedly from a close range and they both succumbed to their injuries at the spot. Till today, no one knows who fired the fatal shots that killed them.By Tennoson Pheirei, TFM Ukhrul CorrespondentTill today, no one knows who fired the fatal shots that killed Mayopam Ramror and Ramkashing Vashi on 30 August 2014. The rallyists who were standing along with the two deceased reported that the gun was shot from the b-hole of the passing armoured vehicle.Rosedinah Ramror, wife of late Mayopam Ramror, in her speech during the funeral programme of her husband held at TNL Ground, Ukhrul on 1 September 2014 lamented that “Though my beloved husband life has been cut short by Manipur state security forces, I beg Naga people not to forsake me and the baby I am carrying in my womb. The lost of a lover and a husband is something I can’t imagine and bear. However, I will take solace and comfort knowing he sacrificed and gave up his life for the greater cause. My heart is heavy.”At that time, Rosedinah wife of Mayopam was only 26 years old and Chanreiwon wife of Ramkashing was only 24 years old and both were pregnant at that time and they gave birth to a baby boy and baby girl respectively in the following months.On August 30, 2014, the United Naga Council (UNC) had called for a public rally in Ukhrul demanding expedition of the settlement of the Indo-Naga issue; respect for the Indo-Naga ceasefire agreement; to honour the democratic dialogue on alternative arrangement between the Government of Manipur (GoM) and UNC; to stop militarization, and to respect land rights of the Nagas amongst others.The rally was opposed by the GoM on the grounds that it would endanger public peace; and a huge contingent of police forces and commandos from other districts (Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur) were also dispatched to Ukhrul town.The rally had started from two main landmarks of Ukhrul Town -Kharasom Junction and Dungrei Junction, and converged at the Tangkhul Naga Long (TNL) Ground. As the group from Kharasom Junction marched towards TNL Ground, police forces allegedly opened fire at Mission Ground, Alungtang injuring many. The police actions soon spread to other parts of Ukhrul Town with teargases, mock bombs and live bullets fired indiscriminately.Mayopam Ramror and Ramkashing Vashi were part of the crowd which had gathered near TNL Ground, waiting for the arrival of other groups to converge.

The post mortem started at 02:30pm and was completed at 05:30pm. The post mortem was conducted on August 31, 2014 by two forensic specialists who came from Imphal and was accompanied by two doctors from Ukhrul Hospital. The whole process was captured in video camera. However, a request for a third party to take the footage was not allowed.As per the post mortem reports, a 9mm bullet was found inside the body of Ramkashing Vashi. In the case of Mayopam Ramror, the bullet entered from the left side of his back and passed through the right side of the neck. This post mortem only re-confirmed that they died from bullet injury and not from tear gas injury as reported by certain media.The Nagas under UNC on September 1, 2014 while condemning in the strongest term, the killings and violence of the Government of Manipur perpetrated on the Nagas in Manipur on August 30, 2014 at Ukhrul declared that “Late Mayopam Ramror and Late Ramkashing Vashi of Teinem Village are hereby declared martyrs of the Naga cause and will be honored as such for all time to come.”It also took a decision for “political boycott of the Government of Manipur in Naga areas including an indefinite ban on all construction work on national projects in Naga areas and ban on all vehicular traffic along National and State Highways in Naga areas to will enforced till such time the Government of India makes a political intervention on our situation with effect from 06:00am of September 4, 2014.”An appeal letter, addressed to Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi by 12507 citizens of Ukhrul as signatories was also submitted on September 8, 2014. The mass signatures campaign called for urgent attention to the issue to prevent the escalation of violence and to bring back normalcy, centrally-constituted judicial investigation into the incident and also the preceding events and immediate withdrawal of the Manipur Police Commando (MPC) and Indian Reserved Battalion (IRB) from in and around Ukhrul District, Manipur. The following day, IRBs and Commandos stationed at various places of Ukhrul District were withdrawn.Today, Rosedinah who is 35 years now is still looking for answers. Speaking to this correspondent, Rosedinah narrated what had happened in 2014 that “it has been 9 years and I will never know who pulled the trigger and killed my husband. I want to know everything that happened on that day. I was pregnant that time and was at home when the incident happened. Family and friends informed me that he was shot in the arms. I desperately tried calling his number. After trying for many times, my elder brother picked up the phone and told me to be calm, he was being given treatment at the hospital and would be back in the evening.”“In the evening, relatives and friends started pouring in to our house. Sensing fear that something drastic might have happened, I enquired one of my relatives to tell me what actaully had happened to my husband. She did not say anything, but, I realised something worst had happened because I noticed tears trickling down from her eyes when she turned away from me. It was only late in the evening that they broke me the actual news that he was no more”.“Our son Ngahanngai Ramror is going to be 9 years soon. He wishes he has someone to call Āvā (father). Sometimes, while coming back home after playing with his friends, he would suddenly ask where was his father? I tried to explain but no words came out. Only tears. It is very painful to explain to my son. I have shown him the grave at TNL Ground, where he was buried along with his friend Ramkashing Vashi. I am yet to explain how he died. When he grows older, I will surely tell the story. For now I can only meet his queries with silence and tears”.Rosedinah Ramror is a single mom who would drop her son in the morning and pick her son after the school who is now studying in class III and rush home for the chore at home.The pain and suffering still persist narrated Chanreiwon Vashi, wife of late Ramkashing Vashi. “on that fateful day, I was at home waiting for my husband to come back home. I had boiled hot water for his bath. I was pregnant that time and gave birth to our daughter on December 4, 2014. I got to know suddenly that my husband was no more when two elders from our village came and informed the news to my in-laws. My daughter is almost 9 years now and is studying Class III at Sacred Heart Higher Secondary School, Ukhrul. I long to know what actually happened that day, who killed my husband. I have accepted that he gave his life for a noble cause and that solace and comfort is enough to forgive the killer.”Chanreiwon Vashi runs a garment shop at Ukhrul to support their son and meet their daily expense.Justice seems far away for the families and loved ones of Mayopam and Ramkashing. They have to move on with time, yet, they seem to be stuck at that point of time when their lives were cruelly ended.Today, in a simple programme, the 9th Martyrs Day of Mayopam and Ramkashing was held on Wednesday at the burial side. The programme was led by President of Tangkhul Naga Long and TNL Phungva. Wreath laying was taken up at the burial site and TNL leaders pays homagae and respect to the two fallen heroes."

The future holds the fear of spooky nightmare. The erstwhile serenity of the state has been left with permanent scar woven in the tapestry of state’s chronicle. Unfortunately, the wails and the cries of the crumbled and torn souls seem to reverberate only within the ranges of the hill-locked land and the eerie sounds have failed to cross the boundaries of the state. It has failed to reach the ears of the nation and an attempt for a solution is a distant dream. With allegations and counter-allegations being flung by the warring groups, questions are being posed every day, what have the authorities done to bail out the land from such a turmoil?While Manipur is drowning in an abyss of its own blood, the only question being asked on everyone’s mind is when the ‘tornado’ that has swept the state will die down. The debris and destruction left by the storm has left us crippled beyond the reality. With embers being lit, sparks are flying, smoke is still bellowing, where do the people of Manipur go and seek for the ‘Oracle’ ? Should the people of Manipur practice for deep transcendental meditation to find an answer for the lost peace?More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024With questions and more questions bubbling with seemingly no certain answers, the only elixir that has been in constant search by the people of the state is only in the hands of none other than the Honourable Prime Minister. With days bygone, his continuous silence has left the people still puzzled and for whatsoever the reasons of the silence, the belief and faith on the Honourable Prime Minister by the people of Manipur is still on with the hope that sooner they will see the light of the day.It is often said that silence is golden. However, the prolonged silence of honourable Prime Minister reminds us of Napoleon Bonaparte who said “The world suffers a lot. Not because the violence of bad people. But because of the silence of the good people.” To end the man-made calamity of the state, is it not required to break the silence of good people? And should the  constitution of the republic be enforced to safeguard the rights and privileges of its own citizens?Today, the reality portrays the story. The lives of the indigenous people are at stake in its own state, and on the verge to get buckled under the aggression of cross-border immigrants. Manipur is undergoing a development drifting back in time. The destruction caused by the violence has left the land at a standstill. With schools and other educational institutions remaining closed for months together, education has seen an unprecedented crisis and developmental work in the state has also received a serious dent. The fear of a socio-economic breakdown is lurking heavily in the near days to come.With no solution at near sight, the days ahead are going to be dimmer. However, the people of Manipur continues to push the boundaries of hope for a constitutional solution to restore normalcy in the violence-ridden state. Perhaps, one fine day, we long to see the shrill echoes of the citizens in Manipur be heard beyond the boundaries of the hills of Manipur and awakened the good people in the nation and to prophecise a tunneling solution that will bring the conflict to its logical end and we find ourselves on the cusp of an exciting and transformative era of Manipur with the state as a hot topic in the “Chai Pe Charcha”.(ChManjitSingh is a Software Architect at an MNC, Bangalore, Karnataka)"
the-government-and-the-emperors-new-clothes,"It is the duty of the media, be it digital, print or electronic to criticize and to critique the system not for any political ends but for the larger interest of the publicBy Paojel Chaoba, Executive Editor, The Frontier ManipurThere have been much polemics over the subtle distinction between ‘to critique and to criticise’. However, the fallout of contemporary politics has both the words tainted with negative connotations like many more outdated and value-neutral words and phrases. Despite the existing twists to popular semantics, those of us from the world of journalism and media had since long been fed with the belief and value that ‘to critique and to criticise is our responsibility and for some perhaps, the job of showering praises and flattering political regimes.Yes! Within the constitutional democracy, we enjoy, it is not only the job of the journalist to critique and to criticise. Each citizen has a duty to perform and can express his or her views freely based on the call of the conscience. This voice from within may instigate us one and all to raise our voices while “the other conscience” influenced by fear and greed may tell you to keep silent and be perhaps make one comfortable with statist views that are contrary of democratic values.Maybe times are bad! The system may seek to convince or confuse and more or less seek to pound one down to submission. It has become a norm to crack the whip on those whose dissenting voices are clearly against any repressive power. Willy-nilly, many have been murmuring that the times are bad. However, the songs of the bad times will be sung aloud and not murmured anymore.One can imagine the predicament and moral issues faced by Galileo Galilei, the scientist who argued that the earth revolves around the sun. His argument was against the Church’s belief on geocentrism – the belief that the earth is fixed at the centre of the universe. Today, we know who was speaking what and what the challenge was. However, our current understanding and acceptance of the conceptual difference between – geocentrism and heliocentrism will be inconsequential to the powers that be of the ages gone by under which Galileo was persecuted. And hence, Galileo was a heretic for challenging the belief of the Church. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and died but he died with his belief in verifiable observation or his own truth.More Stories like thisManipur: Stateless society, state of darknessOct 7, 2023Role of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023Amidst the tumultuous times, we can observe the power of any repressive systems and the ways they act and manoeuvre to win the trust of the public or to confuse all at best. Many are punished for lifting a finger with no chances of getting relief. The executive and the judicial systems are at times seemingly left to twist and dance to the whims of those in power while the common man or a simple peasant is left in the lurch or a vast desert with promises of a bountiful crop. Many continue to shovel and water the ground even as the futility of the exercise cannot be questioned as the proverbial sword of Damocles over their heads. However, those who have endured the labour and pains feel the hunger pangs and the primal need to satiate oneself oscillating between the idea of the citizen and a mere subject of the state. The questioning will have to be raised sooner or later.Presently, we can see those who have raised dissenting voices are being punished. Their arms twisted, some are at times offered sweets and are left to enjoy in private – their voices lost as they salivate and lick the jaggery syrup of the materialistic world. Many intellectuals and those who are known to raise questions are left in a whirlpool of self-doubt. They ask themselves if the effort is worth landing up in the bad books of the regime and take the risk. Many are forced to confine themselves in their comfort zones and cocoons.  It is understandable that those employed by the system would rather tow its line. This does not mean, there are no mavericks around even within the system. They do have eyes to make a distinction between black and white or the proverbial slave-master relationships. There are others who are willing to bare their backs willingly and wait for the whip. History bears witness to Socrates being made to consume hemlock by the Athenians for the allegation of corrupting young minds.Even as widespread oppression seems prevalent and the cheap rhetoric of jokers holds much water, the voices of faceless individuals in their master’s not-so-secret service literally infest the social media, barking at every comment which disagrees with the master’s voice. One can easily conjure up the image of a dog sitting near a gramophone on the once very popular logo of “HMV” or “His Master’s Voice”.It is the duty of the media, be it digital, print or electronic to criticize and to critique the system not for any political ends but for the larger interest of the public and to provide a redressal platform that is prevalent. To remain a silent spectator or to illogically ornate the populist programmes of the government is not a healthy practice. Those in power should learn to acknowledge when the public smells the stink. The dispensation should find out from where it is emanating from, to address the cesspool policies if there is any, instead of lashing out with orchestrated forces and emotive blindness.One is reminded of the literary folktale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen titled “The Emperor’s New Clothes”. The tale revolves around the story of how weavers of a vain king swindle him by giving beautiful ‘invisible clothes’ to appease his ego. The vain king parades around his kingdom in the nude.The public out of fear and reprisal applauds the king and his new outfit, afraid to say that the king is making a fool out of himself. Finally, a young boy points out to the king that he is not wearing any clothes. Similarly, the onus to tread on the lines of the young boy falls on those who dare and also know that we, the citizens have the freedom to express their views without fear while maintaining ethical values."

Asia follows with 556 dead, ahead of Europe 263, then Africa 98 and North America 68.By Nava ThakuriaNearly 2,000 journalists have died of Covid-19 in 94 countries since March 2020. Last year, in 2021, at least 1,400 media workers succumbed to the virus, that is to say 116 per month or some 4 per day on average, announced Friday in Geneva the Press Emblem Campaign (PEC).No continent is spared by the pandemic. Of the 1940 journalists dead registered by the PEC since March 1, 2020, Latin America leads with half of the victims, or 955 deaths. Asia follows with 556 dead, ahead of Europe 263, then Africa 98 and North America 68.More than 50 casualties are still under investigation. The actual number of victims is certainly higher, as the cause of journalists’ deaths is sometimes not specified or their deaths not announced. In some countries, there is no reliable information. The 2000 figure is a low estimate.According to PEC India representative, the vast south-Asian country might have lost over 400 media workers to the pandemic, but a hundred of them are yet to be authenticated.Slowdown in the number of victimsAfter a spike in deadly infections in the first half of 2021, the death toll thankfully slowed in the second half thanks to advances in vaccination, said PEC Secretary-General Blaise Lempen.For the second half of 2021, 225 deaths were registered, with an increase in Europe, and a sharp decrease in Latin America and Asia (in December 25 journalists died, in November 28, in October 27, in September 33, in August 42 and in July 70). In the first half of 2021, 1175 journalists were killed by the virus.The PEC hopes that this slowdown will continue in 2022 but is worried by the high number of infections caused by the Omicron variant.

Attending the occasion as Chief Guest, President of Tangkhul Naga Wungnao Long (TNWL), SA Ramnganing stated that “this festival marked the beginning of new year for us. It is the time for the village Chief to invoke the blessing of the Creator for the wellbeing of the people and land. Once again, it is the time for the villagers to start plantation of various crops.”Luira Phanit Of Nungbi Khullen: Peer groups participating in the folk dance competitionSA Ramnganing continued “Luira is also the time to display our rich culture and tradition. With the coming of age, we are slowly losing our indigenous knowledge and values that are integral to our identity. Haolaa and Pheichak have become only a song and dance performed by the elders.

Preserving our culture and tradition has become the greatest challenge for our people, the Tangkhuls today. We were a people who highly valued honesty, sincerity and hard work. Now, it is different. In the olden days, nobody locked their home. Everybody went to their paddy field without locking their homes, unbothered or anxious of who would enter their house. Today, we are in a different time” added SA Ramnganing.SA Ramnganing further added “May this celebration bring unity, peace and growth among the brethren of Nungbi Khullen. And may the rest of Tangkhul community look up to Nungbi Khullen and emulate to revive their culture and tradition.” As a mark of respect, SA. Ramnganing presented traditional mufflers to the head of the four clan.Clad in traditional attires and singing Haolaa, the villagers escorted the dignitaries from the residence of the Chief to the venue. One of the commendable items was the participation of peer groups (Yarnao) in folk song and folk dance competitions. This year, the Village Authority has made it mandatory for the peer groups to participate in the folk song and folk dance competitions so as to revive and instill the importance of tradition among the young minds. The “Luta Choirs” comprising of elders lead the gathering in rendition of traditional folk song.Many guests from neighbouring villages and Ukhrul Headquarters attended the celebration.

get-it-straight-electoral-politics-and-the-culture-of-violence-in-manipur,"The recent killing of a student in Heirok and all the incidents referred to as pre-poll violence in Manipur have to be understood in the light of prolonged militarization and subsequent inheritance of the culture of violence.By Dhiren A Sadokpam“When we allow violence against some, we enable violence against all.” When Native American writer and progressive activist DaShanne Stokes thought of these lines, he meant much more than what he even thought. And we all know violence begets violence and it is even worse when the very roots of violence are wrongly packaged according to popular conceptions bereft of critical gaze.The shooting and killing of a student, Nigthoujam Rohit of Heirok part-2, Mayai leikai on Tuesday night reportedly by masked men comes after a brief lull in the so called pre-poll related violence in Manipur. These senseless violent incidents should be condemned by one and all. Having said this, there is a need to scrutinize the incidents of violence that keep recurring before the advent and after the assembly elections in a state like Manipur.As reported by TFM, Ningthoujam Premchandra, a 53-year old and father of three sons had retired for the night after having dinner at his home located in Heirok part-2, Mayai leikai on Tuesday (December 21, 2021). At around midnight, the locality was rudely awoken with reverberating sounds of gunshots.Rohit, son of Premchandra heard noises at the back of the house and had opened the door to find out what was happening. The masked men standing nearby, wielding firearms shot him at point blank range with a shotgun. Premchandra rushed towards his son’s side and he too was shot down by the assailants. Rohit died on the way to Raj Medicity Imphal and his father is reported to be still in a critical condition.During the month of October, we had also seen a few incidents of sporadic violence supposedly linked with the forthcoming Manipur Assembly election. The one month following October did not see any major incident that could be termed as dangerous by political observers except the most recent Heirok incident.However, during the first phase of the violence when election moods started swaying the public minds, many political pundits, journalists and even newspapers cherry-picked the phrase “pre-poll violence” to characterize the incidents as they occurred at the dawn of an election season. What was even more interesting to note was that these so called violence took place between the supporters of rival intending candidates for an Assembly election that the Indian Election Commission was yet to schedule.Several academics, public intellectuals, and political party spokespersons expressed their opinions on the issue through the medium of mushrooming online and cable TV Networks in Manipur. Almost all correctly identified violence in any form as a threat to the democratic fabric of the society.However, a larger issue that needs to be addressed with critical lenses is whether or not the pre-poll violence, as we have labelled it, is truly tied to ideological disagreements or conflict between political parties vying to snatch power in the name of electoral democracy. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the issue from multiple perspectives.More Stories like thisManipur: Stateless society, state of darknessOct 7, 2023Role of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023Is the violence between groups and individuals we have witnessed in the state in recent months rooted in the ideological differences between the political parties or party allegiance they have supported? The answer is a clear no. Few people are willing to die for any specific political ideology, whether leftist, rightist, or centrist in the true sense of the words. When the season of electioneering begins, senseless violence occurs as a form to terrorize peoplenotnecessarily in the name of political parties but definitely for the candidates whose political affiliations are known by how close one is to the powers that be. Or perhaps, to settle score with the enemies that was pending for long.Hence, it is imperative to look for the source of the violence elsewhere. We have obfuscated the root cause of the violence by pigeonholing it as electoral violence as if the battle turf was made for settling ideological differences. Most of us view the issue through the lenses of election season and tensions that arise between supporters of rival parties.There are also people who argue that ideological conflicts between opposing parties sparked these violent pre-poll incidents. Here, we must not lose sight of the fact that in a state like Manipur, someone who was a member of an ideologically left-wing party yesterday could become a conservative and right-wing party member today. Political party allegiance and Electoral politics in Manipur have over the years rendered party ideologies totally irrelevant.Therein lies the importance of looking beyond electoral perspectives and focusing on historical, political, cultural, and psychological factors. The history of political violence as we understand in modern Manipur may be traced back to the post-1949 period, when the seeds of violent political confrontation between the state and non-state actors, known as ‘Naharol gi Ehou,’ were sown. As such, our people have lived for a long time in a violent atmosphere where non-state actors have attempted to draw the attention of any regimes. While the state’s response had been the attempt to protect the bigger political structure, everything that happens in the state, from domestic violence to mob violence, must be examined in the context of Manipur’s violent political landscape and resultant fear since the 1940s.Assuming the recent violence “near or within” in our social context as mere electoral violence is hugely mechanical in nature. So to avoid unwanted and irreparable impact on the democratic fabric of society, there is a need to find out the cause of the violence by dissecting them from multiple possibilities.If we go back over the last one hundred years, we can see that a new culture of violence had been ingrained in the society. When one dissects the anatomy of violence in Manipur in a wider sense, we can find two types. The first one is violence caused by the conflict between state and the non-state actors. The violence perpetrated by non-state actors or those who do not want Manipur to be a part of India has been referred to as illegitimate violence whereas violence sanctioned and perpetrated by the state to protect its larger political structure is referred to as legitimate violence. Yet, the crucial point here is that either way, whether it is state induced violence or violence committed by non-state actors, both types impose “internalized violent mindsets” in the people.However, the election-triggered violence that we are discussing right now in Manipur has more to do with money and muscle power, as well as the notion of “challenge” pushed forth by dominance-subservience mindset imbedded in our tradition over the last few centuries as a result of historical circumstances. Here, one can note that practically all the violent incidents discussed here have eventually and legally take “individualized forms”. The only reason we call it electoral or poll violence is because of the temporal factor in sequence. Even a disagreement between two brothers or two families or feud between clans can be read as political violence during election season. This despite the fact that a long standing dispute had nothing to do with the electoral exercise. In this sense, most of the violence we have seen is symptomatic of a culture of violence beyond the confines of Assembly elections. And we too have inherited a distorted form of electoral politics.The culture being referred to here does not mean the pristine idea of culture or tradition. Rather, it refers to the acquired violent psychological state of a community whose members are lodged in a geopolitical landscape perforated by militarization and protracted armed political unrest. This underlying culture of violence may be dormant, but it manifests itself in various forms, whether individualized or institutionalized depending on spatial and temporal contingencies.In claiming that we are inherently violent in character, it does not imply that every member of the society is a raging beast ready to attack one and all. Mob violence in our society for instance is a good example of how inherently violent we people are due to a variety of historical factors. No one seem to think that mobs are logic-less, cultureless, or tradition-less as they are constituent parts of a society. Objective material conditions and prolonged state of militarization have eventually determined their characters. The collective frustration and repressed anger must be taken into account when studying actions expressed in a violent form. Thus, the culture of violence is deeply embedded in our society propelled by extraordinary militarization. The consequences can be fatal in the long run.(Dhiren A.

Krishnatombi Singh was supervising the clearance work of the school ground that started on October 26 to prepare for a helipad.The sources alleged that after the heated agreement that took place on October 29, a co-founder of PPF who is an ex-serviceman, along with a commander of Kuki National Army (KNA) took position near a Meitei Baptist church at Moreh, and using a ‘brand-new’ sniper, procured from Thailand border, shot the SDPO.The source further revealed that miscreants at Moreh are extorting money from the residents of Moreh to buy ammunition, sophisticated weapons, particularly snipers, and also to bring in master trainers from Myanmar into Indian soil to train Chin-Kuki youths as PPF volunteers.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Furthermore, the sources said that the recruits are being sheltered and given arms training at Haolenphai and Sahei, the two Kuki villages lying along the India-Myanmar international border on the Indian side at Moreh.They continued that the extortion drive in its initial campaign could manage to extort a whopping Rs.8.7 crores. According to them the extortion ‘order’ was issued by an influential Chin-Kuki body based at Moreh, under the authority of its president.It also alleged that sophisticated weapons like snipers, assault rifles, rocket propellers, and explosives were recently purchased from Thailand and China.A second batch of arms training of PPF volunteers is underway at Haolenphai and Sahei. It is stated that the KNA commander involved in the sniper ambush was called in to supervise the training of the PPF.Unprecedented ethnic violence erupted in Manipur on May 3, following a tribal solidarity rally that turned violent in Churachandpur district, leading to retaliatory violence between Chin-Kuki-Zo and the Meitei communities across the state.On May 3 itself, violence spread to the international border town of Moreh, with Chin-Kuki miscreants attacking, looting, and burning down Meitei shops and homes in the main commercial town, forcing over 4000 Meitei residents of Moreh fled for safety.Again, on July 26, a large mob torched over 30 abandoned Meitei houses and demolished several other properties.Meanwhile, the Chin-Kuki-Zo civil bodies have being campaigning against the deployment of state security forces at the border town, staging protest demonstrations and even blocking the national highway that connects Imphal with Moreh, rendering Moreh inaccessible by road.As an alternative, choppers are being used to ferry state forces and other supplies in and out of Moreh.Even as the state government were using two helipads maintained by 5 Assam Rifles to access Moreh by air, it decided to make a new one at the Eastern Shine school ground for its movement as Chin-Kuki-Zo womenfolk prevented movement by blocking the road leading to the two helipads.Immediately after the sniper ambush that killed the Moreh SDPO, additional reinforcement of state force reached the border town and sprang into action detecting 32 illegal Myanmarese immigrants on the first day of a search operation on Wednesday."

The Democratic and secular nature of its Policy was best exemplified by the Manipur State Constitution Act 1947 as it was procedurally enacted through a Constituent Assembly that consisted of the Nagas and Kukis, in addition to the Meetei Pangal representatives.The body polity was marked by inclusivity as the first Speaker of the Constitutional Government of Manipur – TC Tiankham was a Kuki, the first Education Minister — Bob Khating – was a Naga. Md. Allimuddin, a Meetei Pangal was also a cabinet minister in the Pre-merger Government of Manipur, reminded the memorandum.More Stories like thisPambei-led UNLF greets RPF on latter’s Raising DayFeb 25, 2024PEC condemns Myanmar junta for murdering reporterFeb 13, 2024PEC demands release of journalist- filmmaker Shin Daewe,…Feb 13, 2024The memorandum said that contrary to Manipur’s long cherished collective conscience, “the propagandist elites belonging to the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi group has been found indulging ethno-centric exclusive campaigns and thus the present tension in Manipur is neither a religious nor a tribal non-tribal issue. “Rather it stems from the resurrection of a Greater Pan-ethno Kuki politics that can only thrive by violently polarizing ethnicities in the Northeastern India and Myanmar (Burma) borderlands”, said the Bangladeshi Manipuri community memorandum.“To arouse ethnic polarity, the self-contradicting narratives of being a free moving nomadic tribe, on one hand, and having a shared Kinship, on the other hand, is invoked to draw an ethnic cartography and a Greater Homeland Zale’n-gam across the entire borderlands of South Asia and Southeast Asia”, mentioned the memorandum. It was also alleged that the involvement of Kuki miscreants in the Tribal Solidarity Rally organized by All Tribal Students Union, Manipur (ATSUM).The memorandum said that the Government of India must note the fact that Zale’n-gam project is to have a long-term ramification on regional peace. “The project Zale’n-gam is an over ambitious project of the Kukis to forcefully integrate regions across the Northeast of India” said the memorandum. The May 3 violence was “pre-meditated” and designed to arouse Kuki ethno aspiration across the region”, alleged the Bangladeshi Manipuri community.“Moreover, the unnatural growth of Kuki population in Manipur from 1% in 1901 to 29% in 2022 explains the enormity of the influx of new Kukis into Manipur which has made indigenous communities insecure. Another alarming reality is the exponential growth in areas under poppy cultivation in Manipur. The reported cultivation of poppy is not less than 6742 acres (2021) in the hill districts of Manipur in close proximity to the Golden Triangle and it makes the region vulnerable to Narco-Terror network”, said the memorandum.The memorandum also pointed out that the Government of Manipur’s stand against poppy cultivation in the hills and its action against settlement in reserved and protected forests have been interpreted as “ethnocentric drive”. The failure to join the drive against poppy cultivation and deforestation by some ethnocentric Kuki elites had disgruntled the public, said the Bangladeshi Manipiuri community.The Bangladeshi Manipuri community said that it is the bounden duty of the Government of India to deter “ethnicization and violence” while delivering its obligations to protect the citizens of Manipur from external aggressions and internal disturbances."

These presentations were followed by a presentation by Watanabe on behalf of Agatsuma about their organisations’ interventionist activities in Myanmar in the horticultural and agricultural domain as steps towards sensitisation the people against poppy plantation and deforestation.Next, Homen Thangjam shared his thoughts about the “essence” of water in Manipuri civilisation and the water crisis that the citizens of Manipur is facing at the moment. He emphasised that once governance distortions are corrected and people get their due shares, many of the crises can be overcome in Manipur including water crisis.Prof N Mohilal Meitei emphasised that we need to learn from people like Agatsuma in bringing about a green world through community participation. Preventing water crisis demands voluntary contribution from the communities and assist government in solving the problem.Vivek K. Vaishnav appraised the activities of the Department of Forestry & Environment Science has been undertaking in the far-flung areas of Manipur. According to him, people resort to illegal practices like poppy cultivation because they want “easy money”. So making people get their deserving basic needs is the call of the hour and at the same time awareness programmes are needed to sensitise people about environmental issues.The presentations were followed by a round of discussion in which participants expressed their opinions. After proposing the Vote of Thanks, Agatsuma and Watanabe distributed Japanese sesame seeds to the participants."
exclusive-captain-murugun-and-oops-mr-decisive-can-i-english-you,"Now if one does not understand Shakespeare, what is his or her fault? He wrote and dramatized inspiring stories during the European golden age of literature. So, if the court’s order is akin to stating that Shakespeare is at fault as the common man failed to understand his plays, then what an observation it was! One is at a loss for words here.By Paojel ChaobaThis is what happened. A Manipuri scholar who goes by his social media nom de guerre Captain Murugun gave a comment on Facebook, loaded with intended sarcasm, intentional satire and comprehensively denouncing the racist treatment that many from Northeast India have experienced in the mainland. And all of us knew exactly what he wanted to convey. This comment followed Mirabai Chanu of Manipur bagging a silver medal in the Tokyo Olympics 2020. Murugun, by his own admission, was so proud, so happy, so exhilarated that a daughter of Manipur outclassed every single weightlifter in her category and contest eventually becoming the second-best in the World, speaking plainly.Though the way Murugun spelled the success of Mirabai and also read the floodgate of accolades opened in India, his way of venting out his views was reportedly not in consonance with some self-styled public mood readers on social media. His reaction was perhaps misunderstood and soon after a local club sounded the battle bugle or the conch depending on one’s cultural interpretation through social media demanding the arrest of Murugun.They insisted that the police should arrest the scholar for his supposedly unkind and unpatriotic comment and for criticizing Mirabai’s achievement! Clearly, there was a failure to communicate between Murugun and the representatives of Mongsangei Kanba Lup. Jumping the gun was another popular film personality, RK Kaiku also at face value, criticized and condemned Murugan’s post. The renowned actor later made an apology on social media. A welcoming gesture from the actor to be able to admit that he made a mistake and misread the comment. He took the courage to admit that he actually goofed up. A brave and courageous man indeed. Now, what do learn here?“What we have here is failure to communicate,” says a line by then Guns and Roses frontman and rock star Axel Rose in his popular song ‘Civil War’. There was obviously a failure of communication between the intended sarcasm of Murugan was lost on the ‘innocence’ of the Mongsangei club.Another issue, we do not know if the police acted on the complaint of the club demanding the arrest of Murugun. The police had submitted that there was no complaint filed against Murugan in response to the Court’s order demanding to know if there were any complaints from anyone. There were no complaints against Murugan. No charges mean that one is not bound to be punished under the Indian Penal Code, the IPC. Yet, Murugan, a student of film studies in his artistic trauma gave an apology to the police stating that he never meant to criticize anyone in his post but that his “satire was misunderstood”. So, Murugan apologized for a crime that he never-never ever committed. What we had here is a failure to communicate.More Stories like thisManipur: Stateless society, state of darknessOct 7, 2023Role of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023The court in its proceedings deemed it fit that there was no need to grant anticipatory bail to Murugan and that there was no FIR filed. He feared that he might be arrested, (for reasons best known to him.) If indeed, the police picked him up, it would be an interesting investigation and to see if the investigating officer could make out of the sarcasm, satire and to literally decipher Murugun’s Facebook post using all available options – legally and literally.  With translation from the dictionary, we would be able to know if Murugan was a trouble maker or an artistic individual who had his own way of communication. The means of communication varies from individual to individual. A poet writes poetry, a painter paints, a lawyer communicates in law, etc. Murugan said it in the way he knew best, and it was in the best interest of not only Mirabai Chanu but for the whole Northeastern community who has long been bearing the brunt of racism.The words of abuses “chinki, chow chow, momo” factor and numerous more incidents of sexual harassment to Northeast women are still evident.  In the Murugan case, the court observed that he might have written in a manner that may have been difficult to decipher or read between the lines and the Mongsangei club may not be at fault as the texts may have been difficult to understand. That is up to the court to pronounce the judgment, but in this case- there was no case. No one filed a complaint against Murugan.  Yet, the court deemed it fit to give observation in a case where there was no case at all if one gets it right as it is the way a layman observes.We are not in proximity nor acquainted with the code of criminal procedure, but the main thing is that we do know deep in our hearts that what is the irrefutable truth and also what is right and what sounds wrong or false. One knows that speaking out well within the confines of the freedom of expression is not a crime, one knows that the proceedings of a particular court may not be fair, that the judgment may leave a foul taste in the mouth that many decisions of the courts may need to be taken with a pinch of salt. One does not agree that activist Stan Swami had to die in prison, one does not agree that it took the court weeks to give him a straw and a sipper to have his daily nutrition, a senior citizen with Parkinson’s disease.  One does not agree that every Facebook user who is critical of the government merits intimidation of being called up by police and harassed. It is not fair that an individual should be slapped with sedition under 124-A, UAPA or NSA just for giving his views which are under one’s constitutional rights. It feels right and it is right to say that archaic British laws like Sedition must go.As one observes, the lady of justice seems no longer blind but winks her eye to those who are wealthy, those who are powerful, and the balance she holds seems to tilt in favour of the side of the influential. The common man is left standing at the gates of justice with a begging bowl which is seldom filled. For years and decades, the common man waits and sometimes the bowl remains empty but only with a promise that the next day of hearing may fill the bowl. The date goes on and on and the most available result in our courtrooms seem to be ‘the next date’ only, some say that the ‘balance’ weighs on the side of power, of influence and corruption, of paisa.Let legal jargons be another thing alien to the layman and his shouts for justice may seldom be heard. Let us come back to Murugun, If one cannot understand the beauty of Mozart’s symphony, if one is not able to understand Freudian concepts, if one is not able to understand the Einstien theory of relativity, if one is not able to appreciate a Picasso painting, is that the fault of the person who drew the masterpiece or the person who fails to appreciate them all. The order of the court seems to imply that Murugan is at fault because he wrote in a manner that was not comprehensible to many. And perhaps that it would be better if Murugan wrote in a language like any layman, like film star Rekha or rather her fan page update. The court seems to focus on simplicity and that sarcasm and satire are incomprehensible to many.Now if one does not understand Shakespeare, what is his or her fault? He wrote and dramatized inspiring stories during the European golden age of literature. So, if the court’s order is akin to stating that Shakespeare is at fault as the common man failed to understand his plays, then what an observation it was! One is at a loss for words here. So, if one is to learn satire and sarcasm as per the judge’s observation, pray tell where one can learn to be Shakespeare? Satire and sarcasm are artistic traits and an inborn quality like being a comedian. One can try being a comedian but when the audience is not laughing, it would be obvious that the man has no gift of the gab or talented sense of humour. He should consider changing his occupation.Similarly, a judge’s observation and judgment may not be as expected and it is the right of the individual to say that the observation does not sit well with him, or perhaps one may be lost in interpretation like the public, like the club of Mongsangei on Murugan’s harsh take on reality. The judge should hold true to his observation that the public is not to blame but the person who do not know how to write satire is, similarly one may not know the judicial translation of a judge’s order and we are the public and cannot be blamed if we are lost in translation also. At the very least, we will say “can I English you”?"

looking-at-hyacinths-from-a-global-perspective,"Water hyacinth, ‘Kabo kang’ in the vernacular as the locals know the plant in the floodplains of central Manipur (in North East India adjoining Myanmar), is no longer an isolated problem for the State so much as information sourced from across the globe indicates that this pervasive plant is a problem for most countries across the seven continentsBy Salam RajeshWater hyacinths just seem to appear repeatedly in all platforms of discussion on invasive alien species at all levels, whether local, subnational, national, regional or global. This aquatic plant with colourful, attractive violet flowers indeed persists as a major factor of concern in most water bodies spread across the globe!Water hyacinth, ‘Kabo kang’ in the vernacular as the locals know the plant in the floodplains of central Manipur (in North East India adjoining Myanmar), is no longer an isolated problem for the State so much as information sourced from across the globe indicates that this pervasive plant is a problem for most countries across the seven continents.From being termed as the “Terror of Bengal” to being seen as a huge nuisance in freshwater ecosystems, hyacinths come and go with the winds, literally. Physical removal is fraught with unsuccessful attempts a, s the plants return almost immediately as soon as most parts of the water body is cleared of the species. This is a first-hand encounter experienced in Manipur’s lone Ramsar site – the Loktak Lake, one of the many water bodies across the globe plagued by this single species.On Monday (11 March) the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) dwelt on the issue as part of a webinar discussion on the knowledge gaps identified in the Thematic Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and Their Control (Invasive Alien Species Assessment) and the needs of new assessments.This writer did notice that one very prominent image that sprang out in the midst of the webinar was that of the water hyacinth, intentionally or unintentionally! It did appear that most people engaged in the study and documentation on invasive alien species is definitely obsessed with this singular plant, as much colourful as it is when it flowers widely.The Invasive Alien Species Assessment builds on the landmark ‘IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ which was launched in 2019. The Global Assessment identified invasive alien species as one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss, with one million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction.The assessment explores how invasive alien species affect nature and people globally. It analyzes the status and trends of invasive alien species in all regions worldwide, and identifies major pathways and drivers of the introduction and spread of such species between and within countries.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Of all the persisting invasive alien species globally, the water hyacinth stands out in the forefront as the ‘champion’! It is regarded as nuisance plant across Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe and the Island nations. It dominates the landscapes, suffocates the water bodies and all organisms that thrive upon the water bodies including those human populations who largely depend on wetlands for their living.In a recent roundtable discussion on invasive alien species at the Manipur State’s Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, this writer put up a reference comparison of hyacinths chocking water bodies in Asia and in Africa, vastly separated by the Indian Ocean yet sharing a similar issue on the impact of this seemingly unconquerable aquatic plant.Two photographs in relative comparison, the one showing hyacinths chocking the Nambul River in urban Imphal (capital city of Manipur State in Asia) and the other chocking the Kisumu Docks within the Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya (in East Africa), amply demonstrated the assertion that hyacinths are plaguing everyone across continents, sparing none.In India, there are numerous reports of hyacinths posing threat to wetland ecosystems and their functionality. For instance, The Hindu covered a recent story on how hyacinths were creating problems in Coimbatore’s Achankulam Lake leading to degradation of the lake ecosystem and biodiversity loss.The UK-based international organization CABI (Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International)’s Working Paper-I on “Climate change and invasive alien species” (2010) noted that, ‘Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a floating neo-tropical species which has become invasive both in the tropics and temperate areas. Outside its native range in South America it can quickly grow to very high densities (over 60 kg/m2) and clogs waterways, preventing movement of boats and fishing activities. Water hyacinth and other water weeds affecting water use currently cost countries in Africa and Asia over US$100 million annually’.The CABI paper further noted that, ‘Precipitation patterns are changing or are projected to change in many parts of the world. Such changes disturb ecosystems and the dynamics of their species, which may not be able to adapt quickly. Changes in run-off alter wetland water regimes and the floristic composition will be prone to invasion by species such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) under inundation and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) under semi-dry situations’.This latter observation is seemingly true of for the Loktak Ramsar site where permanent inundation induced by the Loktak hydro project had created favourable conditions for water hyacinths and other invasive alien species like Alternanthera philoxeroides, Pistia stratiotes and Brachiaria mutica to over-run the water body. These species not only chocks the water body whereas they contribute to the decline of native plant species of food and fodder values that are harvested by the locals to supplement their livelihoods.In some regions, hyacinths are seen as alternative source of livelihood as management strategy to control them. Hyacinth fiber is extracted to manufacture textile and handicraft items. In Bangladesh, floating vegetable farms utilizing layers of hyacinths is a localized adaptation strategy. In Manipur, there was some talk on utilizing hyacinth and other weed matter for compositing and value addition as organic manure but this is yet to take effect.The IPBES’ Thematic Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and Their Control notes with some concern that, “More than 37,000 established alien species, including more than 3500 invasive alien species with documented impacts, have been recorded worldwide. Alien species (plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms, including pathogens) are being introduced globally at an unprecedented rate; currently, approximately 200 new alien species are recorded every year”.At this reading, it is not only about hyacinths but the possible inroad of an increasing number of new species of invasive plants, fishes and insects that could add more issues to the already existing problem posed by the water hyacinth, water lettuce, alligator weed, congress grass and paragrass back home in Manipur, possibly impacting ecosystems and livelihoods, with a further reading on climate change implications"

the title belt open championship being witness by many who thronged the venue, both the titles for men and women categories were captured by the host state, Nagaland, in an exciting and nerve wrecking matches.Temsunungsang (31) of the host state, Nagaland, was declared the champion in the men’s category to receive the coveted belt after knocking out his opponent within few seconds after the bout started.Not giving a chance to let her opponent snatch the title of the prestigious belt in the women category, Kivikali Chophy (22), a fifth semester student of St Joseph’s University, Sovima, Chumukedima, majoring in Business Psychology punched her way through her energetic opponent, Ranjana Rajat, of Assam, who almost matched the receiving ends of the punching and kicking prowess of Kivikali but had to bow down in defeat within the 3 minutes time frame in each round.After being declared the winner in men’s category, the 31 years old Temsunungsang said that by winning the title he has fulfilled his childhood dream and also excited at the same time as he had prepared himself though 3 months long vigorous training right after he got the information about the tournament to held in Dimapur.Kivikali Chophy, who faced stiff tactics from her opponent who threw punches and kicks shared that though the game to her was very new especially the bout in the ring however expressed that she was delighted to experience to be part of the competition though she said she would not be able to continue the sports as she planned to be abroad to pursue her higher studies in her chosen subject.Attending as the guest in the closing programme of the two days sporting event, additional deputy commissioner (ADC), Dimapur, Mhalo Humtsoe, while congratulating the organizers in bringing the national tournament under their ambit and to let the residents of Dimapur witness the matches, she while congratulating the winners in all the different categories and also the participants, and the officials from outside the state has reminded them that the event represents not just about competitions but it was a celebration of the dedication, discipline, and artistry of martial arts/Kungfu.“Whatever the audience witnessed during the matches is a show of your prowess and a culmination of years of rigorous training and unwavering commitment”, she said while also adding that as celebrating the competitors and their achievements, it is also a time to celebrate the principles of integrity and self-improvement that this art could be promoted.She also said that she believed that

manipur-stateless-society-state-of-darkness,"The Supreme Court of India stated that there was an absolute breakdown of constitutional machinery in Manipur. If it is so, where is the central government? Why do they let the violence last for more than 5 months?By Ningthoujam Bigyachandra MeiteiDo we live in a stateless society? Before we discuss anything, first of all, we have to understand what a state is. According to the constitution of India, in Part III of the Fundamental Rights Article 12, the state includes the government and parliament of India, the government and the legislature of each of the states and all local authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the government of India. Apart from that, in a state, governance is one of the key aspects that we have dealt with.“Governance has been defined to refer to political governance, structures, and processes that are designed to ensure accountability, transparency, responsiveness, rule of law, stability, equity and inclusiveness, empowerment, and broad base participation. But the question is, doesn’t it apply in the state of Manipur?In this befallen, wreaking havoc scenario of Manipur, do we really feel or consider that we have a state? In this preplanned and engineered May 3rd, 2023 Mayhem, more than 181 people died, 4700+ houses were vandalised and burned down, and more than 60,000 people were displaced. Who is going to take whole responsibility for these irreplaceable losses? The state and the central governments are responsible for protecting the lives of the people, property, and maintaining law and order situation but in the context of Manipur, this is very much quite contradictory. Instead of protecting life and property and maintaining law and order, the state let the people come out on the street, arming, fighting, and killing each other to defend themselves. Is it a sign of an existing state? Due to the malfunction of the state let by the irresponsible elected MLAs and Ministers, the people pay the price for that. This is very unfortunate, especially in the largest democratic country in the world like India.Chief Minister N.Biren Singh himself stated that the ongoing Manipur Mayhem since May 3rd, 2023, is between the state government and a group of people who want to bifurcate the integrity of Manipur. If it is so, why does the state government let the Meitei/Meetei community become a victim who wants to protect the territorial integrity of Manipur? On the other side, why did Union Home Minister Amit Shah say “Control the Ema Meira Paibis (women torchbearers); don’t let them hinder the movement of troops; I will end the crisis within 10 days”? Instead of appreciating the Maira Paibis, the union home minister doubted the prime role played by the Maira Paibis in protecting the territorial integrity of Union and its Manipur. This is very unfortunate. At least he must acknowledge, the role played by the Meira Paibi in the History of Manipur.Moreover, more than 40,000 central forces have been deploying in Manipur to control the ongoing violence. But the question is, did they control the wreak mayhem of Manipur? In lieu of controlling the mayhem situation and protecting the lives and property of the people, they use excessive power towards civilians and unarmed student protesters in the name of controlling the livid mob. And they are biassed when performing their duties. On May 22, 2023, the JAT Regiment and other central forces assaulted three journalists who were covering the violent incident at New Checkon. And on May 26, 2023, night, a group of individuals, including 3 (three) RAF personnel, attacked a beef shop in the New Checkon area and attempted to set fire to it. And on 13th June, 2023, RAF personnel were caught on camera vandalising private vehicles and the windows of residential houses in Imphal. And on June 16th, RAF personnel arrested and assaulted numerous unarmed and layman civilians.One Ningombam Sunil, a resident of Brahmapur Lalji Lakpa Leikai was reportedly assaulted at his residence without any provocation or inquiry by RAF personnel. And an ambulance of the Indian Red Cross Society, Manipur Branch, was prevented from reaching Yaingangpokpi in Imphal east by the Indian Army, violating international humanitarian law and its protocols in 24th June 2023. Many such incidents have been happening in Manipur. Even the government has already acknowledged such unprecedented violence incidents, but they have not responded nothing. Still, they hold up sitting and twisting their legs like a mute spectators. In the name of controlling the mob, the paramilitary forces, RAF, and state forces used tear gas, smoke bombs, and even live rounds and pellet guns towards the unarmed and democratic protesters. Is thistruly a sign of an existing state?Furthermore, I would like to draw the attention of the people here that the state government, along with the central government, compromised more than 181 lives of people with 10 lakhs each. Is it fear? Where is the profound value of life? Is life worthless and bargainous? Is this some kind of joke? Do we need to think state government exists? This is very unfortunate to happen in the largest democratic country in the world.Moreover, the Solicitor General of India himself expressed that the unclaimed bodies lying in the mortuary are Myanmar nationals. This indicates that there is some external influence or aggression from other countries, like Myanmar, that instigate the present Manipur wreak havoc in such an assailable way. Even the state and central government have already acknowledged: why do they let the violence continue for more than 5th months and let the people die to defend themselves and arming each other? Isn’t it the duty of the state and central government to protect the lives and property of their citizens? If it is not so, what is the necessary to become a part of India? Still, the state and central government let the Chin-Kuki Narco terrorist group attack the people of Manipur, targeting the Meetei/Meitei community. Is it a sign of an existing state?More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024Even the Supreme Court of India stated that there was an absolute breakdown of constitutional machinery in Manipur. If it is so, where is the central government? Why do they let the violence last for more than 5 months? If they are genuinely concerned about Manipur, they can control the violence from a long time back. Maintaining law and order is the prime responsibility of the state. Although they are maintaining law and order only in the valley areas and not in the other parts of Manipur, especially in hill areas, we are very reluctant and confused that, in the name of controlling the livid mob, they even used pellet guns and live round towards the unarmed students and civilian protesters in the valley. But only the question is: what about in the hills? Did they even use smoke bombs and tear gas to the so-called civilian protesters who were carrying arms in the so-called peace rally in Churachanpur?In the hill areas like Churachanpur, Moreh, Kangpokpi etc, central forces and state police personnel become “ZERO” but in the valley areas, they just become “HERO”. Is this a sign of the same law applied both in the hill and valley in the state of Manipur? Even the central and state forces trespassed on the fundamental rights of Article 19, “Right to freedom of speech and expression, right to freedom of assembly, which are given in the Constitution of India, in the name of controlling the irate mob. Such behavior and attitude of the police personnel and central forces, we are very much confused whether the state is existed or not.On the other hand, out of 60 MLAs, 10 are from the Chin-Kuki community, and some of them are even cabinet ministers. They are demanding the bifurcation of the state and its integrity. As a MLA and Minister, in the oath-taking ceremony, they have taken an oath in the name of the constitution and God that they will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India, as by law established that they will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, and it states that they will faithfully and conscientiously discharge their duties as a MLA or Minister for the Union, and it states and that they will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the constitution and the law without fear or favor, affection or ill-will. But instead of abiding, they try to destroy and bifurcate the integrity of Manipur. The conduct of the 10 Chin-Kuki MLAs is unethical and a breach of oath, but still, the government did not take any action against the 10 Chin-Kuki MLAs. Only the question is, where is the state government?Moreover, the Chin-Kuki narco-terrorist group is still attacking the farmers by using sophisticated weapons from the top of the hills. More than 5,127 hectors are not yet able to cultivate, especially in the peripheral areas of foot hills. Such terrorist act engineered by the Chin-Kuki narco-terrorist group, might cause an artificial famine in the state of Manipur.One of the vital aspects that I would like to address here is that the Chin-Kuki community is trying to wipe out even the footprints of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Chin-Kuki-dominated hill areas, especially in Churarachpur, Moreh, Kangpokpi, etc. They completely burned down, vandalised, and razed the entire Meitei/Meetei houses and properties, making them entirely been levelled like a playing field. The government has already acknowledged and witnessed such inhumane and barbaric phenomenon’s. But they did not take any appropriate action against them. In such an irresponsible manner of the government, do we need to trust the commitment of the government?Last but not least, many questions have been raised since May 3rd from different people from different angles about where the state is. Do we live in a state? Is the state government existing? Is this violence a sign of an existing state? Is the state government blind and deaf? Will the state take the whole responsibilities for this state irresponsible violence? Is it an appropriate time for sitting and twisting legs like a mute spectator? Still, we are in a state of darkness.(Ningthoujam Bigyachandra Meitei is a student pursuing MA (Public Administration)"
from-paris-to-dubai-indias-climate-action-journey,"The least said, it is apparently clear that the Government of India had set its priority in meeting the climate goals that had been continuously featured, argued and highlighted in most of the global-level climate negotiations in recent yearsBy Salam RajeshThe International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s World Economic Outlook Report (July, 2023) projected India as the fastest-growing major economy in the world at a 6.1 percent growth rate during 2023. The report’s projection cast a phenomenal transition of India’s progress at a time when the global growth ‘would see a downturn from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3 percent in 2023 due to many factors, including the long-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic’. This, in short, is India’s story of resilience despite the global uncertainties and many domestic challenges.Edging on with the national accomplishment, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC, Government of India) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) together released a report last year-end, “From Paris to Dubai, India’s Climate Action Journey – Resolve to Result” (2023).Prime Minister Narendra Modi reflecting on the report says, “Our firm belief in following a lifestyle based on sustainable practices becomes clear when the world sees that India’s per capita carbon footprint is 60 percent lower than the global average. It is the manifestation of the same conviction that drives our Mission LiFE – Lifestyle for Environment”.Outlining India’s climate action journey, the MoEFCC & UNDP report profiles the kickoff since the year 2006 when the country took stock of its environmental concerns to ‘identify key vulnerabilities of India to climate change, (and) assess the need for adaptation to future climate change’.With this broad objective in view, an Expert Committee on Impacts of Climate Change was constituted in 2007 to ‘study the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on India and identify measures to address vulnerability to these impacts’.The proposal comes in the wake of the general assessment that India is third next to the United States of America and China as nations with maximum load of carbon emission from different sources. In 2019, an assessment by the international climate observer – Climate Watch – placed India at the tenth position with the United States and Russia as top carbon emitters. This assessment finds reflection in the MoEFCC & UNDP 2023 report profiling India’s commitment to lowering its position as one amongst the top carbon emitting countries in the world.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Progressing through the succeeding years from its commitment to formulating a National Action Plan on Climate Change (2008) down to the Climate Change Action Programme (2014) India relentlessly strove to achieve its commitments. This was strengthened through the formation of an Apex Committee for Implementation of the Paris Agreement in 2020 with the broad perspective to ‘create and strengthen scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change; to establish an appropriate framework for research, policy, and implementation of climate change-related actions’.Climate Change process is primarily studied from two angles, that which is naturally occurred (Nature-induced Climate Change) and that which is inherently influenced by humans (Human-induced Climate Change). In current terminology, it is more on the latter process that the world is primarily concerned with, as anthropogenic influences are seen as more critical at this point of time. It is assessed that dramatic changes in the climatic conditions worldwide have been hastened by different human activities that are critically negative in outlook and in effect.In 2022, the National Designated Authority for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement was constituted with focus on the updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to ‘enhance India’s contribution towards the achievement of the strengthening of global response to the threat of climate change, as agreed under the Paris Agreement’. This signified the country’s leadership’s thrust on achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius by the year 2030.There were, and are, hard criticisms that the world had failed on many fronts to achieve its climate goals, including the worst-case scenario on the failure of not meeting the objectives set in the Aichi Targets nor of the Kyoto Protocols, and much less said on the Paris Agreement. The Dubai 2023 climate negotiations were mired in controversy on fossil fuel promoters sidelining the main objectives on meeting climate goals post-Paris Agreement.The MoEFCC & UNDP 2023 report highlights India’s thrust on Climate Change negotiation as reflected in the 2023-2024 Union Budget with its Green Growth game plan, which is envisioned as a quick-gain step for enabling climate action in India by introducing Seven Priorities (Saptarishi) to speed up the ground-level priority action on Climate Change mitigation and adaptation measures.The Saptarishi are Inclusive Development, Reaching the Last Mile, Financial Sector, Infrastructure and Investment, Unleashing the Potential, Youth Power and Green Growth. This broadly looks at balancing the act between investing in green infrastructure while addressing the needs of the marginalized sections of society. With programs around green fuel, climate-friendly farming, green buildings, low-carbon mobility, and policies for efficient energy use across various economic sectors, the 2023-24 Budget lays a strong foundation for pushing hard on the green growth trajectory.Quite interestingly, the 2023-2024 Union Budget features the GOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan) scheme with an outlay of INR 100 billion allocation to ‘establish 500 new “waste to wealth” plants under the scheme for promoting a circular economy and the production of bio-energy’. The plan includes proposal for setting up 200 compressed biogas plants (75 in urban areas and 125 in rural areas), and 300 community or cluster-based plants.Other schemes initiated by the Union Government for meeting its climate goal targets include the Pradhan Mantri Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment and Amelioration of Mother Earth; Green Credit program; Sustainable Ecosystem Development; setting up 10,000 bio-input resource centres to facilitate adoption of natural farming; promotion of energy transition and energy storage projects; promotion of coastal shipping for energy efficient transportation; and funds allocation for fleet replacement of government vehicles.Another of India’s initiative in meeting its climate goals is the Sovereign Green Bonds (SGBs) scheme. The SGBs scheme, flagged off on 25January last year, has reportedly achieved good response from global as well as domestic investors. SGBs amounting to 1.91 billion USD (INR160 billion) are reported issued in the last financial year for mobilizing resources for green infrastructure projects. The Government issued the bonds in two tranches of USD 959 million (INR 80 billion) each on 25 January and on 09 February last year. The proceeds are being deployed into public sector projects that contribute to expanding renewable energy production and reducing the carbon intensity of its economy.The least said, it apparently is clear that the Government of India had set its priority in meeting the climate goals that had been continuously featured, argued and highlighted in most of the global-level climate negotiations in recent years. The world is said to be headed for climate catastrophe unless countries heed to their commitments as outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement."
lilong-chingjao-firing-kcp-asks-md-hassan-to-leave-manipur-by-january-10-or-face-death-penalty,"Politburo Standing Committee took the decision for his role in narcotics trade, which the Party considers a form of crime against humanity, and his close association with Kuki narco-terrorist elements, which are directly involved in the ongoing unholy war against the indigenous people of Kangleipak, said KCP.It also warned against those trying to incite communal feud after Lilong Chingjao incidentTFM DeskThe Proscribed Kanglelpak Communist Party (KCP) on Wednesday (January 3) warned against those “indulging in anything that can create frictions between the Meetei/Meitei and Pangal communities in the wake of January 1 Lilong Chingjao fatal firing incident.In a statement issued by deputy secretary, information and public relation M Punshiba Meitei, the outfit expressed concerns over “the fact that some vested interests are now trying hard to drive a wedge between the already “sensitive” communities. The KCP will not hesitate to take serious action against them, irrespective of which community or religion they belong to, it said.The outfit also said its Politburo Standing Committee decided to exile Md. Hassan S/o Md. Habibur from Manipur permanently for his role in narcotics trade, which the Party considers a form of crime against humanity, and his close association with Kuki narco-terrorist elements, which are directly involved in the ongoing unholy war against the indigenous people of Kangleipak.Asking him to leave Manipur by January 10, the KCP said the Party will award him the death penalty on the spot if he is found in any part of Kangleipak after it.Stating that the outfit is deeply saddened by the loss of lives in the incident, the KCP shared some alleged dark facts about Md. Hassan “to enable the people to make an informed understanding of what might have led a highly reputed liberation organization like the RPF/PLA to come after him”.More Stories like thisPambei-led UNLF greets RPF on latter’s Raising DayFeb 25, 2024Bidyananda sent to police custody for five more daysFeb 10, 2024UNLF condoles demise of Pvt MongoljaoFeb 5, 2024The KCP said Md. Hassan has been under its radar for a long time now for his role in narcotics trade. Though he has dealt mostly in heroin, opium is another major narcotic substance that he deals in, it added.The outfit said Apart from his Kuki narco-terrorist partners, who supply him with opium and other drugs, Md. Hassan has many narcotics trade partners in West Bengal, where he regularly sends narcotic substances through his paid carriers, who are mostly Muslims from various places of Manipur like Kwakta, Lilong and Sora.For every kilogram of herion, he reportedly pays around 50,000 rupees. Some of his carriers were caught in West Bengal, and they were left to rot in jail without getting any help from him. One of his carriers named Md. Jabir from Thoubal Khunou, who was caught in Kolkata, lost his life in a Kolkata prison in 2020. During Jabir’s long imprisonment, his “employer,” Md Hassan, did not extend any kind of help to him, it alleged.The outfit also claimed that Md. Hassan runs a lab somewhere in Lilong area, where opium is chemically processed to obtain what is called “crude”, which is further processed to produce heroin.The statement further after seeing the video coverage of Hassan’s massive multi-crore house, it makes sense to assume that his massive house is for a narcotics manufacturing lab. “Otherwise, why would his family of five members have built a fortified complex with a 12-mm iron gate?” it asked.Asserting Hassan is not an industrialist or established businessman, the outfit asked why nobody is raising questions on the source of his massive wealth. “Why haven’t the law enforcement agencies of the puppet government bothered to investigate his finances till today?” it said.The outfit also raised volley of questions: “Why didn’t the concerned government agencies seal off the spot, including the residence of Md Hassan? Why did the police and/or other investigating agencies allow his family and local henchmen to stay inside the house with some even carrying away some suspicious items from inside the house soon after the Incident thus indicating the possibility of his family and henchmen erasing/eliminating all forms of evidence of the presence of his narcotics lab inside his massive residence?”It also asked, “Why hasn’t his family and local henchmen handed over the DVR of the CCTV network of his residence to the police or the government forensic laboratory?”"
#respond,"India emerge SAFF U16 champions, make short work of Bangladesh in final. India 2 (Bharat Lairenjam, 8’, Levis Zangminlun, 74’) Beat Bangladesh 0TFM Sports DeskEven as deceptive calm prevails in Manipur following the continuing spat of ethnic violence, two boys from the state- a Meitei and a Kuki –made India proud after they scored two goals to lift the South Asian Football Federation SAFF under-16 champion trophy held at Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu, Bhutan. Of the total 23 players of the Indian squad, 16 are from strife-torn Manipur, and among them, 11 are Meities, Kuki (4) and a Meitei Pangal (Manipuri Muslim).In the high-octane final, Bharat Lairenjam found the net in the first half, while Levis Zangminlun sealed the victory with a second-half goal, ensuring a comfortable win for India. According to AIFF Media Team, the moment referee Hussain Zaheer blew the final whistle, the young Indian squad erupted in jubilation. The players embraced one another, their faces glowing with uncontainable happiness for a mission superbly executed.PHOTO CREDIT: AIFFGuided by head coach Ishfaq Ahmed, the Blue Colts had a sparkling run throughout the championship. They exhibited a mesmerising brand of free-flowing, attacking football that left opponents struggling. They finished top of Group A after edging out Bangladesh and Nepal with 1-0 victories in both instances. Their semi-final clash with the Maldives was a masterclass in offence, resulting in an 8-0 triumph. Remarkably, the team accomplished all of this without conceding a single goal throughout the tournament, says a report by AIFF media team.More Stories like this3rd North East Games: Nagaland still dominates medal tally…Mar 21, 20243rd North East Games: Nagaland leads medal tally on Day 1Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024In the final match against Bangladesh, India displayed tactical prowess and control. With adept ball distribution and intelligent utilisation of available space, they effectively countered Bangladesh’s more physical style of play. Key contributors like Mohammad Arbash, Vishal Yadav, and Levis Zangminlun penetrated the Bangladeshi defence with fluid runs and skillful dribbling, making it easier for India to dictate the tempo from start to finish.At the heart of India’s defence was the indomitable Karish Soram. Always alert, he fearlessly placed his body in the line of fire whenever the situation demanded. And when Bangladesh found a way past him, India goalkeeper Aheibam Suraj Singh stood like a rock, unyielding and resolute.India’s initial breakthrough came early, just eight minutes into the match. Levis Zangminlun provided an incisive through ball to forward Bharat Lairenjam, who swiftly invaded the space ahead and slotted the ball between the legs of Bangladesh goalkeeper Mohammad Nahidul Islam to score.Bangladesh responded to India’s goal and got a chance to equalise but Mohammed Mursed Ali fluffed his lines. The forward beat the offside trap and took control of a through ball from Bangladesh captain Nazmul Huda Faysal. However, India goalkeeper Suraj Singh swiftly charged forward to cut down the angle, causing Ali to miss the target.Throughout the first half, Lairenjam and India’s captain, Mate Ngamgouhou, consistently pressured the Bangladeshi defence, creating multiple scoring opportunities. In the 34th minute, a particularly promising chance materialised. A long ball was lofted towards the Bangladesh penalty area, prompting Indian forward Mohammad Arbash to give chase. Recognising that Bangladeshi goalkeeper Nahidul Islam had ventured off his line to attempt a clearance, Arbash seized the moment. He skillfully attempted to head the ball over the onrushing keeper. However, Islam was quick to react, successfully punching the ball out of harm’s way and preserving the 1-0 scoreline as the teams entered halftime.India started the second half with the same intensity. Their relentless search for another goal bore fruit in the 74th minute with a sublime strike. Samson Ahongshangbam initiated a promising move down the left wing before expertly switching play to send the ball to Levis Zangminlun on the opposite flank. Engaging in a swift one-two pass with Vishal Yadav, Zangminlun outmanoeuvred his defender to find himself in open space. Taking a moment to set himself, he then unleashed a devastating left-footed strike that sailed into the back of the net, doubling India’s advantage.INDIA XI: Aheibam Suraj Singh, Mate Ngamgouhou, Karish Soram, Mohammed Kaif, Levis Zangminlun, Md Arbash (Manbhakupar Malngiang, 83’), Bharat Lairenjam (Aiborlang Kharthangmaw, 90’), Vishal Yadav (Bobby Singh, 83’), Samson Ahongshangbam (Rishi Singh Ningthoukhongjam, 90’), Yaipharemba Chingakham, Thoungamba Singh Usham."

manipur-needs-a-surgical-strike-to-eradicate-illegal-drugs-poppy-plantations,"By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively through the deployment of the Armed Forces, the government (and the Armed Forces) can not only dispel suspicions and distrust, but also contribute significantly to the lasting peace, security, and well-being of ManipurBy Dr. Marc NongmaithemManipur, a state nestled in the northeastern part of India, is grappling with a profound ethnic crisis that has been aggravated by the unlawful cultivation of poppy and cannabis in its hilly terrain. As the poppy harvest season approaches, it becomes crucial for Manipur’s residents to join hands with various stakeholders and call upon the Central Government and the Home Ministry to deploy the Armed Forces in eliminating these illicit plantations. This urgency stems from the fact that the illicit drug trade has significantly contributed to the ongoing crisis, perpetuating violence and instability in the region. It is imperative to emphasize the need for eradicating these unlawful plantations, addressing the plight of displaced individuals, and seeking a targeted solution to Manipur’s current crisis.Manipur’s natural beauty, specially the hills, have been marred by the illegal cultivation of poppy and cannabis. As the poppy harvest season approaches, there is growing concern that drug production and trafficking will intensify, exacerbating the already fragile situation. The proceeds from the drug trade have been the main source of funding for various insurgent groups, perpetuating conflict and instability in the region as we see today. The drug trade has attracted criminal elements, including drug cartels and armed groups, who have a vested interest in maintaining the current status quo.The ongoing crisis has resulted in the displacement of numerous individuals and families, turning them into Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). These displaced people are now living in precarious conditions, struggling to make ends meet and lacking a sense of purpose in life. The lack of government efforts for their rehabilitation and welfare is a pressing concern, and many IDPs are contemplating extreme measures, including suicide, due to the perceived apathy by the authorities. The number of IDPs in various relief camps is gradually increasing due to the continued and sporadic violence erupting from time to time. There is no clear plan from the government to help these IDPs return to their homes peacefully or to put an end to the violence once and for all. The status quo persists, and so does the violence and the rampant illegal cultivation of cannabis and poppies in the hills. In other words, the current measures and policy deployed in Manipur to restore peace is not working!More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024While the Armed Forces have established a buffer zone and maintained a semblance of peace in certain conflict-ridden areas of Manipur, it is clear that these measures are temporary and insufficient to bring about a lasting solution. Violence continues to erupt sporadically, and the root cause of the problem—illegal drug plantations—remains largely unaddressed.The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) gives the Indian Army broad powers to operate in designated “disturbed areas.” However, these powers are not unrestricted, and they seem to be subject to directives from the central government. In the hills of Manipur, illegal poppy plantations are thriving, apparently with the knowledge of the nearby Armed Forces deployments. The Armed Forces appear to be turning a blind eye to this, citing the need for specific orders from higher authorities before taking action. This is despite the fact that the Armed Forces has been busting drug transporters within the state and beyond. However, they have hardly busted any illegal cannabis and poppy plantations. Similarly, CM Biren’s War on Drugs initiatives have been busting transporters and growers of poppy and poppy products, but there have been no cases of illegal cannabis plantations being destroyed. These inconsistencies raise questions about the government’s true commitment to resolve the ongoing ethnic crisis in Manipur.The people of Manipur, along with various stakeholders, must unite and demand that the Central Government and the Home Ministry take decisive action against illegal drug plantations. The urgency of this call is underscored by the impending poppy harvest season, which threatens to further exacerbate the drug problem and the associated violence in Manipur. A “surgical strike” on these illegal drug plantations would be the most effective way to deal with the current problem. This would involve a coordinated effort by the Central Government and Armed Forces to destroy the plantations and arrest the perpetrators. The crisis in Manipur, fueled by illegal poppy and cannabis plantations, has persisted for far too long. It is imperative that the Central Government and the Home Ministry listen to the unified voice of Manipur’s residents and take decisive action to destroy these illegal plantations. If the Central Government fails to take swift action, it will be seen as condoning the drug mafia and its activities.Therefore, the Central Government must come up without fail, with a precise and effective “surgical” approach to tackle the root cause of the present ethnic crisis in Manipur. Eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis plantations by deploying the Armed Forces is “the crucial step” that is missing or being ignored by the Central Government. This would certainly break the backbone of the present narco-terrorism and would significantly undermine the financial resources of armed groups and criminal networks in Manipur. By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively through the deployment of the Armed Forces, the government (and the Armed Forces) can not only dispel suspicions and distrust, but also contribute significantly to the lasting peace, security, and well-being of Manipur.(Dr Marc Nongmaithem is an informed/concerned citizen who loves to write on issues of public importance.

On this day, the people reminisce the valiant sons of Manipur who sacrificed their lives and chose the gallows poll over timid surrender to British colonial rule. Their martyrdom and gallant acts have been considered as the highest form of patriotism by many.On this day, the people of Manipur also ardently recall the Anglo-Manipuri War of 1891, an event considered as the last war of Manipur’s independence. In the war, many courageous sons of the soil laid down their lives to save the dignity, honour and sovereignty of their motherland. In the face of inescapable defeat, they had the valour to fight against the mighty empire of the British.In the aftermath of the Battle of Khongjom in 1891, Manipur lost its independence to the British. On August 13, 1891, Prince Tikendrajit and Thangal General were hanged. In remembering those brave sons, people pay the highest kind of tribute and honour to the bravehearts who are still considered true patriots of Manipur.When recalling such historical narrative, it has become more than necessary to inject unflinching adjectives to those considered patriots for the love of their motherland. However, the official rituals surrounding the marking of the day has also served as an opportunity to contemplate on the very idea of patriotism. So, what actually is patriotism in the context of official rituals and ethno-nationalistic construction of the same idea? This question calls for a rigour in serious inquiry even if the intent can be termed as academic by many.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024One is aware of the fact that there are several definitions of patriotism in many disciplines – both humanities and social sciences. However, the most common and accepted definition of patriotism in existent literature, relates it to the “notions of love and devotion towards one’s own country”. Thus the definition of patriotism has centred on one fundamental form, often referred to as the attachment of a group or members of a group to the country in which they belong.Patriotism has also been described as comprising of attachment and love on the one hand, commitment and citizen involvement on the other. Scholars have also argued that patriotism is not to be identified with blind support to one’s nation. A patriot may be critical of his own nation and also resist acts performed or committed by his own nation-state. In other words, patriotism is a way of thinking, an acquired belief with or without a political ideology.Ideology as primarily understood in Sociological discourse is directly related to sets of cultural beliefs, values and attitudes that serve a society to reinforce a structure or a changed set of adopted beliefs that can exert pressure on the same structure.  Thus, every culture has an ideology that can invent, import and recover values to either unify or fracture the overall structure of the society.However, there have been virtually no specific and rigorous scholarships on the contours of how societies in the Northeast region of India developed their own set of patriotism or ideologies with specific reference to social, political or historical context. Despite the virtual absence of the exercise, it has been quite interesting to observe the impact of value system and diverse paths opted by ethnic communities since time immemorial irrespective of territorial constraints.When one juxtaposes the history of ideology against the overall political developments in the Northeast, interesting observations have been made. However, no effort has been made to understand the dynamics in the invention, import and recovery of ideologies vis-à-vis patriotism.Even the official recorded histories have little mention of the ruptures in ideology and how the same have shaped one’s idea of patriotism developed over the span of few centuries. Mention may be made of the period witnessed in Manipur since the advent of Hinduism with the arrivals of Brahmins in 15thCentury till the defeat of Manipur in the last war of independence in 1891.Over the last few decades, contemporary scholars have missed probing deeper into how a society composed of numerous communities have traversed through shifts and turns in value system as represented by ideology and how the same have shaped one’s own understanding of patriotism. This is why there is a need not only to review the content of patriotism but also probe into how ideology and patriotism interact. In short adequate light is needed to understand the invention, import and recovery of ideology lost in the labyrinth of ethno-nationalism inspired patriotism(s)."
honour-sc-verdict-on-electoral-bonds-proactively-mpcc-asks-modi-govt,"“The State Bank of India must disclose the details of the electoral bonds before the poll of the ensuing Lok Sabha election because the people of India have a right to know the secretive details of the electoral bonds that have helped the BJP to be in power,” it said.TFM DeskThe Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) on Thursday demanded the Modi government to “proactively honour the Supreme Court’s verdict”. “The State Bank of India must disclose the details of the electoral bonds before the poll of the ensuing Lok Sabha election because the people of India have a right to know the secretive details of the electoral bonds that have helped the BJP to be in power,” it said.In a Press Conference addressed by senior spokesperson & AICC Member Ningombam Bupenda Meitei at Congress Bhavan in Imphal on Thursday, the MPCC said on 15th February, 2024, the Constitution Bench of 5 Judges of the Supreme Court of India gave a judgement striking down the Electoral Bonds’ Scheme, which was introduced by the BJP Government at the Centre in 2017 in the Finance Bill 2017 during Union Budget 2017-18, as unconstitutional.MPCC General Secretary (Admn.) S. Jeeten, party’s General Secretary (Org.) Amir Hussain and General Secretary (Elections) H. Meghachandra were present in the press conference.It further said in the Para 219 (b), (c) and (d) of the said judgment in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 880 of 2017 in Association for Democratic Reforms &Anr. Versus Union of India &Ors., it has directed the State Bank of India to submit details of the Electoral Bonds purchased between 12th April, 2019 till date to the Election Commission of India, to submit the details of political parties which have received contributions through Electoral Bonds between 12th April, 2019 till date to the Election Commission of India, and to submit the above information to the ECI by 6th March, 2024.But, on 4th March, 2024, the SBI filed an application to the Supreme Court seeking an extension of time till 30th June, 2024, to furnish the information regarding electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India, it added.The MPCC spokesperson said the SBI, in its application, submitted, “In that time period, twenty-two thousand two hundred seventeen (22,217) electoral bonds were used for making donations to various political parties. Redeemed Bonds were deposited to Mumbai Main Branch by the Authorised Branches at the end of each phase in sealed envelopes. Coupled with the fact that two different information silos existed, this would mean that a total of forty four thousand four hundred and thirty four (44,434) information sets would have to be decoded, compiled and compared.”In the meantime, today, the Association for Democratic Reforms has filed a contempt petition against the State Bank of India for non-compliance with the Supreme Court to disclose details of electoral bonds, he said.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024He claimed the ruling BJP, being the primary beneficiary of the electoral bond scheme, faced discomfort after the Supreme Court’s decision. Political parties collectively received over Rs 12,000 (twelve thousand) crores since the electoral bond scheme was introduced in 2017; and, out of the total of Rs 12,000 crores, the BJP alone received Rs 6,566 (six thousand five hundred sixty six) crores which is constituting 55% of the entire electoral bonds, he added.He further said the BJP is concerned about the potential exposure of its ties with select corporates once the information about donors becomes public. Therefore, the Modi government appears to have pressured the State Bank of India not to share the information. Hence, the SBI filed an application before the Supreme Court, seeking an extension until 30thJune, 2024, which is after the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, he added.This deliberate delay is questionable, as the country’s largest and fully computerised bank should not need months to provide information about electoral bonds, as it can be done within a few minutes of time or in a day. This delay is an indication to suggest that the SBI is being used to conceal the BJP’s financial irregularities, financial scam and the source of black money, he said.He also said Even in 2017, the Election Commission of India, on 26th May, 2017, wrote to Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, that the Amendments in the Finance Act 2017, which has introduced certain amendments in the Income Tax Act, the Representation of the People Act 1951 and the Companies Act, 2013, will have serious impact on transparency aspect of political finance/ funding of political parties and would increase use of black money for political funding through shell companies.Stating that Electoral Bond is a misnomer, which is nothing to do with funding for election, he said it has been used to enrich the party in power, particularly the BJP, by disproportionately providing an uneven level playing field among the political parties. The public has a right to know, and the public must be informed before the poll of the ensuing Lok Sabha election of 2024, as the information required can be furnished within a day in Modi’s Digital India, he added.He maintained that historically, corporate donations to political parties were completely banned by the introduction of Section 293A into the Companies Act, 1956, by way of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969. But, Electoral Bonds’ Scheme (EBS) has eliminated all safeguards without any constitutionally valid justification by allowing loss-making companies to funnel money to political parties or allowing companies to pump money into political parties without any caps or allowing company boards to make decisions about political donations in secrecy or unrestricted corporate financing of political parties. he said.“These had endangered the free and fair elections in the country. And, maximum benefits of these corporate funding through electoral bonds scheme have gone to the BJP only through the EBS,” he added.He claimed that for Electoral Bond Scheme-2018, in a letter, dated 25-06-2018, written by the State Bank of India to Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, it furnished the information that a total cost of Rs. 1,50,15,338 was a net cost of floating of Electoral Bonds, in which Rs. 60,43,005 was used for IT Systems Development and Rs. 89,72,333 was used for Operational Costs. So, where have these IT systems, which were installed for the electoral bonds, in the SBI gone today?Throwing a volley of questions, he asked, “Why are the SBI, which has lakhs of employees, taking months to match 44,434 sets of information? Why is the SBI taking an extension of time, which goes beyond the result of the ensuing Lok Sabha election result? Is it not an attempt by the Modi government to conceal the quid-pro-quo between the BJP and the big corporates’ funding through electoral bonds? Is this concealment not amounting to corruption?”"

manipur-tops-chart-for-largest-change-in-net-warming-during-winter,"Some pockets of the State in Chandel, Churachandpur and Tengnoupal districts bordering Myanmar experienced blistering heat at plus 40 degree Celsius during the past three years where half a century back the maximum summer temperature would fluctuate around 32 degree CelsiusBy Salam RajeshThe small Eastern Himalayan nation state of Manipur, sandwiched between South Asia and Southeast Asia, hogs the national limelight for two quite obvious reasons, the one for significant achievements in national and world sports, and the other for an entirely wrong reason – figuring in the national pollution chart or for topping weather anomalies at the national consideration.A few years back the short-distance flowing Nambul River, which negotiates through the fairly urbanized capital city of Imphal and which deposits directly into the freshwater Loktak Lake – a Ramsar site, figured shamefully among the top eleven polluting rivers in India. The National Green Tribunal had in 2018 pulled up the State for inaction, listing the river in category-II amongst severely polluted rivers in India.In a surprising twist of event on the climate front, too, Manipur suddenly finds itself in the hot seat, being listed as the top State in the country experiencing the largest change in net warming during winter of year 2023 and into year 2024 throughout India!A recent assessment by Climate Central, a global independent group of scientists and communicators reporting facts about the changing world’s climate scenario and how it affects people’s lives, noted Manipur in India’s far east as experiencing the largest change in net warming at 2.3 degree Celsius during winter last year and early this year, while the national capital Delhi experienced the smallest change in net warming during winter with a margin of 0.2 degree Celsius. This reading was charted on a baseline studied since the year 1970.The Climate Central report stated that the global mean temperatures have risen by more than 1.3 degree Celsius since the year 1850, and have set a new record in year 2023, while attributing the primary cause of this warming to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from factors like excessive burning of coal, oil, and natural gas by industries and other agencies across the globe.More Stories like thisManipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Looking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Dr. Andrew Pershing, vice-president for Science at Climate Central, observed that, “The cooling in the central and northern Indian states during January followed by very strong warming in February creates the potential for a quick jump from winter to spring-like conditions. By burning coal and oil, humans have warmed the planet leading to warmer conditions in all seasons across India”.The Climate Central report, while observing that there are notable differences in the pattern of temperature changes during the winter season, stated that the southern parts of the country had strong warming during December 2023 and in January 2024.The report noted that the northern parts of the country had weaker warming and even cooling during December and January. Delhi had the lowest rates during this period (at -0.2 degree Celsius in December 2023, and -0.8 degree Celsius in January 2024), and among the states Ladakh (at 0.1 degree Celsius in December 2023) and Uttar Pradesh (at -0.8 degree Celsius in January 2024) had the lowest warming rates.On a similar footing, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its weather reading for January and February earlier this year had indicated warmer months in the northeast region where the minimum actual winter temperature in January 2024 was 10.25 degree Celsius against the normal 9.96 degree Celsius with an anomaly of 0.29 degree Celsius, while in February the minimum temperature shot up to 13.21 degree Celsius from the normal 12.66 degree Celsius with an anomaly of 0.54 degree Celsius.The IMD attributed this factor to the increasing global warming which since has been altering the weather patterns, leading to anomalies in the temperatures and the rainfall patterns. It specifically referred to global warming continuously pushing the mercury to new levels, indicating that ‘initially it was the maximum temperatures that registered the rise, but now minimum temperatures are also following the same route’.The diurnal temperature variation, which is the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, has decreased, the IMD’s recent report stated stressing that February month earlier this year witnessed the second highest minimum temperature in the month since the year 1901.Climate models studying the weather anomalies had indicated several hotspots around the world that are going to experience record breaking heat this summer. The forecast is there that year 2024 could be amongst the hottest years ever in a century’s time. Parts of Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Far East, and South America are going to bend under a blistering heat due to the El Nino influence. The only glimmering hope is that El Nino will weaken gradually and La Nina would hopefully edge in to ensure normal monsoons.However, for the humans and other life forms on this planet, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s 2023 assessment that, ‘Climate change is altering the frequency, duration, and intensity of many types of extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall, and fire weather conditions’ does not brood happy tidings, while the organization had in 2021 warned that, ‘Extreme weather events would increase in South Asia, including India, and heat waves would become more intense and frequent in the 21st century’.Manipur during the past decades had steadily felt the heat of this assessment with observed increasing temperatures with each passing year, and some pockets of the State in Chandel, Churachandpur and Tengnoupal districts bordering Myanmar experienced blistering heat at plus 40 degree Celsius during the past three years where half a century back the maximum summer temperature would fluctuate around 32 degree Celsius."

The mayhem has resulted in the rise of several relief camps that have sprung up in many pockets of the land-locked state seeking humanitarian services for the impacted families from various fellow citizens and organizations. The volatility of the situation remains an alarming one seemingly resolving the issue – an uncertain almost to absurdity!The entropy among the people has increased, the coherence has lost, leading to chaos of several narrations, unwanted incidents now and then. The state is witnessing an unprecedented rise in the use of arms, difficult to digest in the minds of common people on how these weapons managed to cross the border and created a mayhem in our beautiful border-land. Perhaps the hands of the various unlawful organisations operating in the proximity of the border region might play a role. Notwithstanding that the involvement of other malicious players also can never be denied. The unprecedented turmoil has also spawned mushrooming of self-proclaimed vigilante groups and are suspected to have influence on the use of these arms.Amidst the chaos and the ongoing conflict, another dark side of the usage of heavy weapons, arising out of the Manipur mayhem, seem to be lurking in the days to come. The recovery of the illegally stashed arms require a herculean effort from the government and the law enforcement agencies, almost amounts to impossible. These small arms could spread across the population, imagining a real-time scenario, when such a situation arises, it can lead to collateral damages that may be much more than one can fathom. There is a very high probability of the rise of organised crime rates and even deployment of arms in trivial localised confrontations. It may not be exaggeration to foresee gunslingers who may roam the streets like in the erstwhile wild-wild west as seen in a Western movie, and law and order in Manipur may go haywire! At the most we can only hope that peace prevails upon the people soon so as to truly restore the bygone state of brotherhood in the beautiful land of nature.(Ch Manjit Singh is a Software Architect at an MNC, Bangalore, Karnataka)"

It is believed that over 200 persons have been killed in the ongoing violence though the state government is yet to come up with the latest official figure on the number of persons who had been killed or injured, it said.“Whatever the total number is, the violence continues sporadically and people still fear that fresh rounds of violence will hit them without the innocent people not knowing that they would be victims of conflict,” added EEVFAM.“Affected by the ongoing violence and chaos, we at EEVFAM are still deeply saddened and shocked at the way how events have unfolded in Manipur since May 3, 2023,” it said.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Distribution of PDS rice in Nagaland under scanner; CNCCI…Mar 8, 2024Sharing their views on the ongoing crisis, EEVFAM said that being widows, mothers and relatives of persons who had been victims of extrajudicial killings, they can truly feel the pains and traumatic experience of those killed in the post-May 3, 2023 violence.Maintaining that they were speaking from the real-life perspective of those who have lost our near and dear ones, EEVFAM said as widows, they have struggled for our survival and dignity. They have faced the immense hardships while trying to raise our own children. Those of us, who are married are single-parents who are supporting the well-being of our children, it added.“In the current context, we have also discovered that many of us are “double or triple-time victims” of violence irrespective of what community we belong to. Those of us who married outside our own communities had to bear the brunt of the current violence too,” it said.“It also said, “Others who had been victims of state-sponsored violence have also now become victims of ethnic violence.

We do not at all encourage the views that AFSPA should be re-imposed in specific areas where the ACT has been lifted in the last few years,”It also reiterated that as victims of AFSPA related violence, they encompass all the victims in of AFSPA in Manipur irrespective of their social, economic, religious and ethnic background. “And now is the time to say that “Enough is enough”, we do not need any form of violence – be it state-sponsored violence or vested interest-triggered violence. At the end of the day, violence and conflict affect all people of the state. Stop violence and also repeal AFSPA from Manipur,” it said.“Over the years, our struggle have also seen substantial progress. We are referring to EEVFAM versus Union of India case in which the Supreme Court of India gave a landmark judgment. This judgment was delivered on July 8,¬ 2016, and our struggle against military impunity continues.“In this case, EEVFAM had filed a petition seeking an investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings by security forces in Manipur. The petition highlighted numerous cases where security forces were accused of committing extrajudicial killings under the guise of counter-insurgency operations,” it said."

The forum of nationalist citizens opines that the verdict of the Supreme Court will be obeyed, but the PPFA raises a pertinent question- Can a court in India repeal an act, which was passed by both Houses of Parliament and subsequently signed by the President, head of state of the Republic of India.The PPFA, which sent a memorandum to the Assam Governor supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 (and faced uncivilised criticism for some anti-national elements), maintains that the government publicity machineries should divulge all the sensitive facts to the people relating to the CAA rules respecting their  anxieties.Moreover, the forum appealed to the group of Guwahati-based editor-journalists, which outright rejected the CAB and even organised a meeting with the Governor five years back, to clarify their stand if they have accepted the CAA or bowed down to the authority and public sentiments emerged on social media in the last few days."
in-the-face-of-orchestrated-hatred-silence-is-not-an-option-says-an-appeal-to-constitutional-institutions-issued-by-journalists-and-media-persons,"In an appeal to India’s constitutional institutions, the signatories who are journalists and media persons said that the concerted amplification of hatred has been growing over the past years and months, as has the attendant advocacy of violence.TFM DeskJournalists and media persons from all over India on Wednesday appealed to all Indian institutions to step in and uphold their constitutional mandate in the wake of open calls from various quarters for attacks on India’s religious minorities, especially Muslims.In an appeal to India’s constitutional institutions, the signatories who are journalists and media persons said that the concerted amplification of hatred has been growing over the past years and months, as has the attendant advocacy of violence. “Sometimes, the occasion is an election, at other times it is a political gathering, a so-called ‘dharam sansad’, or a controversy over clothing. or even the screening of a movie. These calls for violence – which have been widely reported in the media – have been met with a cold and calculated silence from the country’s top leaders” said the appeal.The statement also pointed out that months before, there was “systematic hate” being propagated against Muslims under the pretext of Covid-19, including calls by legislators for their socio-economic boycott. Disturbingly, the term ‘corona jihad’ was fabricated and amplified by sections of the media establishment.The appeal goes on to state that calls for violence or the socio-economic boycott of a community clearly do not enjoy the constitutional protection of free speech. And yet, the political executive – both at the level of the Union and in several States – appears unwilling to discharge its constitutional obligation to act. The police either take no cognisance of those inciting anti-minority violence or register cases under disproportionately mild sections, which strengthens the perception that such offenders are above the law, said these signatories.Against this backdrop, the President of India, the Chief Justices and other Judges of the Supreme Court of India and the various High Courts, the Election Commission of India, and other constitutionally provisioned and statutory bodies are constitutionally obliged to ensure that these calls for violence do not translate into something unimaginably worse.Since sections of the media have also allowed themselves to become “conduits for hate speech”, the Press Council of India, the News Broadcasters & Digital Association, unions and associations of working journalists, and all media-related bodies need to respond urgently to the crisis at hand, said the appeal.More Stories like thisMeitei Students JNU Condemn Gruesome murder of 2 Meitei…Sep 27, 2023Manipur’s Media Storm: Armed Forces Under Scrutiny…Sep 16, 2023FIR filed against 4 Over Editors’ Guild of India…Sep 4, 2023Since December 2021, well-synchronised calls for the annihilation of Muslims have been made, beginning with a religious meet in Haridwar that month. Muslim women and girls have been systematically targeted in 2021 and 2022 through social media platforms, including the pernicious Bulli Bai App. The ugly controversy over the hijab in Karnataka has resulted in Muslim women in different parts of India being harassed and humiliated, pointed out the appeal.During the election campaign of February and March 2022, there was repeated appeal to divisive hatred and the “stigmatising of Muslims and other minorities”, with ‘star’ campaigners from the ruling party unashamedly breaking the law to seek votes in the name of religion. The Election Commission of India, which is statutorily bound to ensure that such practices do not corrode the integrity of elections, has not shown the required autonomy and independence from the political executive to act.Most recently, the screening of ‘The Kashmir Files’ – a film that cynically exploits the suffering and tragedy of the Kashmiri Pandits by using their plight as a pretext for the promotion of hatred against Muslims – has seen orchestrated attempts inside and outside movie halls to incite anti-Muslim sentiment. Attempts have been made from the highest levels of government to stifle fully justified criticism of the film and of the violent reaction it is generating by claiming there is a “conspiracy” afoot to “discredit” it, said the appeal.“When all these events are taken together, it is clear that a dangerous hysteria is being built up countrywide to push the idea that “Hinduism is in danger” and to portray Muslim Indians as a threat to Hindu Indians and to India itself. Only prompt and effective action by our constitutional, statutory, and democratic institutions can challenge, contain, and stop this disturbing trend”, said the signatories.The appeal also lamented the fact that India today stands at a dangerous place, with the founding values of our secular, democratic, and republican Constitution coming under flagrant assault from prejudiced ideas, acts of prejudice, discrimination, and violent incidents, all planned and orchestrated as part of an anti-constitutional political project.“That we have seen elected officials and others who have sworn an oath under the Constitution amplifying some of these multiple and connected instances of orchestrated hate through acts of commission and omission, with sections of the media assisting this project, makes the situation even more urgent”, said the appeal.The signatories said that this was why it is both urgent and crucial that India’s constitutional institutions, and especially the President, the higher judiciary, and the Election Commission, discharge their mandate under our Constitution and that the media perform their responsibility to the people of India by asserting their independence and speaking truth to power.The appeal was signed by N Ram, former Editor-in-Chief, The Hindu & Director, The Hindu Publishing Group; Mrinal Pande, Senior Journalist and Writer; R Rajagopal, Editor, The Telegraph; Vinod Jose, Executive Editor, Caravan; R Vijayasankar, Editor, Frontline; W Naqvi, Chairman & MD, Satya Hindi; Ashutosh, Editorial Director, Satya Hindi; Siddharth Vardarajan, Founder Editor, The Wire; Siddharth Bhatia, Founder Editor, The Wire; MK Venu, Founder Editor, The Wire; Aziz Tankarvi, Publisher, Gujarat Today; Ravindra Ambekar, Director, MaxMaharashtra; RK Radhakrishnan, Senior Journalist; Deepal Trivedi, Founder Editor: Vibes of India, Gujarat; Hasan Kamal, Senior Journalist & Columnist, Inquilab; Teesta Setalvad, Co-Editor, Sabrangindia; Javed Anand, Co-Editor, Sabrangindia; Pradip Phanjoubam, Editor, Imphal Review of Arts and Politics; Anuradha Bhasin, Executive Editor, Kashmir Times; Kalpana Sharma, Independent Journalist; Aunindyo Chakravarty, Independent journalist; Saba Naqvi, Independent Journalist; Dhanya Rajendran, Editor in Chief, The News Minute; Shabir Ahmed, Senior News Editor, The News Minute; Anirban Roy, Editor, Northeast Now, Guwahati; Dhiren A.

Most of them are Palestinians working for different media outlets, including foreign mediaTFM DeskWith 140 journalists killed, 2023 was the deadliest year in ten years, the Press Emblem Campaign (PEC), the global media safety and rights body, announced in Geneva on Wednesday. Two-thirds of the victims were in the Middle East, with almost one killed every day in the last three months of the year in Gaza.The PEC strongly condemned all these attacks and sent its condolences to the victims’ families and loved ones. It called for those responsible for these crimes to be brought to justice as quickly as possible.PEC said of the 140 media workers killed in 28 countries, at least 81 have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October. Most of them are Palestinians working for different media outlets, including foreign media. They were killed in indiscriminate Israeli strikes, often in their homes, along with members of their families. The Asian region lost 12 journalists to assailants till the last day of December. Pakistan and India lost three scribes each, while Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Philippines have lost two media persons each in the year, it added.More Stories like thisPEC expresses concern over arrest of Burmese journalistsDec 15, 2023Record number of journalists killed in Gaza within 2 monthsDec 9, 2023Meitei Diaspora in Europe with IPSA VP Stages…Sep 30, 2023“We condemn these indiscriminate strikes, which do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters. While it is difficult to verify whether journalists were intentionally targeted or not, the Israeli army has systematically destroyed the Palestinian media in Gaza by bombing their offices and facilities”, said Blaise Lempen, president of PEC (https://pressemblem.ch/casualties.shtml).PEC also said that this is the highest media death toll in a conflict in such a short space of time. The PEC lamented that foreign media access to Gaza remains impracticable due to the security conditions, which prevent independent reporting from the parties to the conflict. Outside the Gaza Strip, 59 journalists have been killed in 27 countries. The situation did not improve in Mexico, where 9 journalists were killed, and deteriorated in Guatemala, where five murdered. Four journalists died in the war in Ukraine (1 Italian, 1 French, 2 Russians), as did 4 in Israel during the Hamas attack on 7 October, it added.Three victims were recorded in Cameroon, Lebanon besides India and Pakistan. Two victims were reported in the following countries: Haiti, Nigeria, United States of America besides Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Philippines. One journalist was killed each in Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, Honduras, Lesotho, Mali, Mozambique, Paraguay, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and Syria. By region, the Middle East led the way with 64% of cases (90 deaths), followed by Latin America with 20, Asia with 12, Africa with 11, Europe with 4 and North America with 3.Compared with 2022 (116 killed), a year marked by the start of the war in Ukraine, the increase in the number of victims is just over 20%. In 2012, the deadliest year since the beginning of the century, 141 journalists were killed (including 35 in the war in Syria). Over the last five years (2019 to 2023), the most dangerous countries for media workers were the Gaza Strip (Palestine) with 81 killed, followed by Mexico with 61 and Ukraine with 39. Next came Pakistan with 32 deaths, India 31, Afghanistan 29, the Philippines 19, Honduras 14 and Syria 14, followed by Haiti 12 and Somalia 10.Over the last ten years (2014 to 2023), 1,147 media workers have been killed, an average of 2.2 per week. The PEC includes in its statistics all journalists killed, whether or not their death was related to their professional activity. It is difficult to prove that a crime was committed in connection with a journalist’s work without a full and independent investigation, which is often lacking.PEC’s south & southeast Asia representative Nava Thakuria revealed that Pakistan lost Imtiaz Baig, Ghulam Asghar Khand and Jan Mohammed Mahar to assailants last year, where as India witnessed the killing of Shashikant Warishe, Abdur Rauf Alamgir and Vimal Kumar Yadav. Similarly, Ashiqul Islam and Golam Rabbani Nadim lost their lives in Bangladesh, where Husein Naderi and Akmal Nazari were killed in Afghanistan, and Cresenciano Bunduquin and Juan Jumalon in the Philippines."

bringing-women-at-the-forefront-of-sustainable-mountain-ecosystems,"The decade counting from the year 2021 up to the year 2030 is being focused by the United Nations as significant for the restoration of all types of ecosystems to address several issues confronting the world community, more perversely the climate issues.By Salam RajeshThe year 2022 is expected to see activities focused on mountain ecosystems to address myriad issues connected to human life, the natural surroundings and all other life forms that thrive in the natural landscapes. These encompass a global effort in looking forward to a time zone when the blue planet will be relatively free from the stress on environmental degradation and degeneration that threatens climate catastrophe.Deliberations on the topic are heating up with various research findings and general publications focused on the subject. As a part of this ongoing dialogue, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) discusses the role of women in sustainable mountain ecosystems through its publication ‘Critical approaches towards gender in mountain ecosystems’ (IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management, 2021).Bringing the gender profile at the forefront of the discussion, the IUCN CEM’s report says that, “Women are vital to environmental action in mountain ecosystems. Their contributions to resource management, biodiversity conservation, water and food security cannot be stressed enough. On average, women in mountainous communities are more likely to engage in agricultural activities than their male counterparts. Similarly, they are more likely to stay behind as men migrate to urban centres. Since women are at the forefront of mountain ecosystems, they are also more sensitive to environmental change and degradation”.The IUCN gender profile talks generally of women all over the world who live and thrive in mountain ecosystems, linking their lives to the natural surroundings for all of their needs. This is particularly relevant for the people in the mountainous region that geographically is termed as the ‘Northeast’. The eight sister States in the region are typically mountainous by nature and the people are adapted to living in rough and tough mountain landscape.In Manipur, lifestyle is adapted to two domineering landscapes: floodplain and mountain ecosystem. A rough area of around ninety percent of the State is mountainous and is inhabited by different ethnic communities, quite distinguished from one another by their differing lifestyle, food habits, dress and custom, and belief system. The common thing is that they all have to adjust themselves to a lifestyle that is tough and rough by nature.In this setting is the role of women in providing for the family and working in the agricultural fields for almost the entire period of the year coping with the different seasonal activities. So much so as the IUCN CEM report details, the multiple role of the women here in the State is definitely defined by their ability to harness the resources of nature for their living and sustenance.In the midst of this hard-profiling conversation on gender is the emerging fact, as the key message in the IUCN report puts it, that, “Women play a key role in nature conservation, yet they often lack the inputs, technologies, training and extension services, and various enablers and linkages that can enhance the effectiveness of their efforts. They rarely formally participate in shaping conservation policies or programs”.More Stories like thisManipur: Stateless society, state of darknessOct 7, 2023Role of ECI in Manipur’s Electoral Process: A Systemic…Sep 26, 2023A Call for Hard Negotiations to Eliminate Illegal Poppy,…Sep 26, 2023The core of the discussion comes to the fact finding conclusion that women in general hardly find space in the decision making process in most instances. As is in the Indian system typically, the predominance of the male in decision making process is too evident. The women are usually relegated to the second layer of community affairs, often not given the opportunity to have their say in the decision making process.Male chauvinism is all too evident in almost all forums beginning from the village structure to the highest forum at State level. This writer has been witnessed to several processes at the village structure where the women are there only in namesake, hardly asked for their opinion nor providing space for them to have their say. The little amount of female voice that comes up, too, is subdued by the ultimate decision that is dominated by the male voice. This is then the tragedy when the women are actually co-partners in providing for the family and in managing their agricultural fields and also shouldering equal responsibility in many activities including forest resource management and protection.The decade counting from the year 2021 up to the year 2030 is being focused by the United Nations as significant for the restoration of all types of ecosystems to address several issues confronting the world community, more perversely the climate issues. There is no differentiation between male and female when it comes to collective effort at global ecosystem restoration. Everyone is a co-partner in this immense task.The Global Gender Gap Report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2018) states that, “Across the 149 countries studied, no country has yet achieved full gender parity. Moreover, gender disparities are one of the key barriers to economic growth and poverty reduction”.The truth is seen evidently on ground as and when dealing with decisions to be taken at the community level. More often than not, the decisions taken are male-opinion driven with less of time and space given to women to voice their concerns. This writer has been party to several community level interactions where for the better duration the discussions are led by the male voice without prioritizing women and children’s needs and concerns.The IUCN study seeks to understand the level of community-led initiatives where women are the driving force. In South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and in Africa, as is true of in many other smaller nations, women are now seen taking proactive role in conservation and management of different ecosystems ranging from forests to mangroves, wetlands and mountain ecosystems.Citing multitudes of good examples across the world where women are in the forefront of community-led initiatives in conservation, the IUCN CEM report is specific on the positivity of gender involvement in sustainable mountain ecosystems. The report says, “Notwithstanding the continued challenges of high out-migration rates and policy neglect, the women’s solutions demonstrate effectiveness in enhancing the resilience of the target community and empowering women to lead nature conservation initiatives in the region”.Peter R.W.Gerritsen writing for the IUCN CEM report says, “Poverty remains an outstanding concern. Global biodiversity loss is another major challenge that humanity faces. The loss of plant and animal species is rising at an unprecedented rate. Both challenges, poverty and biodiversity depletion, appear as interrelated in mountainous environments, which are often inhabited by structurally disempowered and marginalized indigenous peoples”.Peter’s observation cannot be better placed in a setting like the ‘Northeast’ where for the better part of their lives, mountain communities have to struggle much to achieve food and water security. Depletion of forests and a corresponding loss of water sources is a process that adds to the burden of mountain communities. It, therefore, necessitates prioritizing strategies for intensive ecosystem restoration to address multiple issues of which food and water securities are dire necessities. Policy planners need to lend an ear on this with due earnest.(The writer is a media professional working on environmental issues. He can be contacted at[email protected])"

However, for the people WESEA and Kangleicha, this is a day when they hide under the shameful feelings of enslavement and shame, claimed ASUK.ASUK recalled that three years before India adopted its constitution, Manipur Constitution Act 1947 was already in force after it was adopted on July 26 of 1947. Under this constitution, Manipur held its first National Assembly Election in 1948. Manipur State Assembly was promulgated on October 18, 1948 wherein a coalition government was established led by a political party called ‘Praja Shanti’.The alliance pointed out that the democratic election was held with real citizens of Manipur participating in the event, thus Manipur became the first ever people’s sovereign state in the whole of South East Asia. Unfortunately, Manipur was annexed by India on October 15, 1949 and made into a Part-C State. “Did Manipur join India on its own accord with a plebiscite or referendum? There were a few people who wanted that Manipur be merged with India but the ruling coalition led by Praja Shanti on March 23, 1949 submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister of India and Congress President clearly stating that almost cent per cent of the Manipuris are against integration or merging will be clear from a referendum. In a public meeting on August 3, 1949, Praja Shanti resolved that Rule (under Manipur Constitution Act, 1947 ) cannot be abolished and the state cannot be integrated or merged”, said ASUK.“This show that neither the neither the responsible government of Manipur nor its people discussed or consented to the merger or annexation of Manipur. Moreover, a Part-C State is lower in status that a Union Territory and almost equivalent to an Indian District. Manpur got its statehood in 1972. And this was truly an insult to the people who had a written history over 2000 years”, rued ASUK.“What has been the condition of Manipur under India in the last 75 years? Right now, we are surviving in areas identified as Buffer Zone/Red Line/Laxman Rekha unable to move. This is India’s way of stating that the people of Manipur cannot be Indians and even more clearer than the voices of the people that they are not Indians”, asserts ASUK pointing out that currently India is treating as if Manipur people are not their citizens.ASUK further added that “today, India cannot provide safety and security to its citizens nor safeguard their properties despite that fact that India has been a adopting a democratic constitution since 1950. India’s Prime Minister has been keeping silent and seems to be watching what is being unfolded in Manipur since May 3, 2023. It should be recalled that in 1962, during Sino-Indo War, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also in a radio broadcast said “I pity for the peoples of Assam”.“Today, we have no other option but to stand on our own feet in our own land. The currently given situation further points to the the urgent need for the restoration of the Mannipur’s status in 1948 as a Nation State. This could be the only option we have”, asserted ASUK and stated that this is also why the people of Manipur should be boycotting India’s Republic Day."

Ram Muivah, Hon’ble MLA of 44-Ukhrul Assembly Constituency attended the opening ceremony as chief guest. Krishna Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Ukhrul as guest of honour and David K Shimray, President of Tangkhul Naga Long as special guest.Speaking at the occasion, Ram Muivah extends his greatest respect and salutes to the legend Maj Bob Khathing Ralengnao. Ram Muivah stated, “Maj Bob Khathing Ralengnao contributions to the Indian Army and diplomacy have left an indelible mark on the country’s history. He is responsible for bringing Tawang under Indian administrative control without shedding a drop of blood. If and when the situation normalizes between India and China, he deserves to be honored with Bharat Ratna posthumously.” Ram Muivah also recollects the great football players the Tangkhul community has produced at the national and international level. He lauded the initiative of the Assam Rifles in remembering the most distinguished and respected figures of the country.Brigadier Vaibhav Shinde, Commander 10 Sector Assam Rifles in his opening address stated, “I am privileged to host the 111th Late Major Bob Khathing tournament 2023, after a gap of two years. The last celebrations were in the yr 2020 and due to the COVID resistance, the celebrations could not be undertaken in the year 2021 and 2022. The conduct of the tournament every year is an important facet of paying tribute to the legend Late Maj Bob Khathing. Late Maj Bob Ralengnao Khathing is one of the most distinguished and respected figures in Indian history. He was a man of exceptional courage, a true patriot, and a visionary leader. His contributions to the Indian Army and diplomacy have left an indelible mark on the country’s history and continue to inspire generations of young people. He was born on 28 February 1912 at Ukhrul, Manipur. He did his schooling at Kangokpi Mission School and Johnstone Higher Secondary School, Imphal and later joined Cotton College, Guwahati from where he graduated. On 17 January 1951, Major Bob Khathing accompanied by Captain Hem Bahadur Limbu, 200 troops of 5 Assam Rifles and 600 porters left the foothills for his historic mission who brought Tawang under Indian Administrative control without shedding a drop of blood.Ralengnao Khathing left for heavenly abode at his home Valley View, Mantriphukri, Imphal on 12 January 1990. He was an awardee of Padma Shri, Member of the Order of the British Empire Military Cross and two times recipient of C-in-C Gallantry Certificate and was posthumously awarded “Arunachal Ratna” in February 2021. Bob Khathing’s legacy goes beyond his contributions to exploration and diplomacy. He was a man of deep integrity, a leader who was respected and admired by all who knew him. He had an unwavering commitment to his country, and his life was a testament to the power of courage, perseverance and a deep love for one’s fellow citizens. His legacy has inspired generations of young people to take up the cause of national service and to work towards the betterment of their fellow citizens. As we remember Major Bob Khathing today, let us rededicate ourselves to the values of selflessness, integrity and a deep love for our country. Let us strive to emulate his example and to work towards a brighter future for ourselves and for our nation.Col. Manoj Shinde, Comandant of 35 Assam Rifles in his welcome address stated, “At the outset, on behalf of IGAR(S) and 10 Sector Assam Rifles, I welcome the chief guest Honourable MLA of 44-Ukhrul Assembly Constituency, Shri Ram Muivah, IAS Retd, Guest of Honour Shri Krishna Kumar, IAS, Deputy Commissioner of Ukhrul and the Special Guest Mr David K Shimray, President of Tangkhul Naga Long for taking out time and to be with us to witness the opening ceremony of 111th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Late Maj Bob Khathing.

failure-of-government-to-control-price-hikes-and-difficulties-faced-by-people,"Instead of trying to impose nationalistic feelings on us, such as hoisting the tricolour or attempting to divide our people based on religion, the government should first try to focus its attention on how to solve the economic depreciation.By Jayanta SharangthemThe maximum population of the state is under the poverty line and they can’t manage the day-to-day financial burden of their families due to the price rise of essential items like kitchenware and other household items. The price of cooking gas crossed Rs. 1200. And now the GST rates on food grains have been raised. Everybody knows the current price of cooking gas and how the government increases its price day after day. But the farmers, for their agricultural products, are facing the worst situation day by day for the fertilizers and water during the monsoon season because sometimes there is no rain, due to which there is less production of food grains, but at the same time, the government hikes the GST rate on daily essential items, which then becomes hard to survive. Due to the GST rate hike, many household and kitchen items will become costlier. So, the houses are going to be adjourned sine die amid price rises and GST (Goods and Services Tax) hikes.HERE ARE SOME ITEMS THAT GET COSTLIER AFTER GST REVISION (W.E.F 18 JULY, 2022)ITEMSGST SLAPPREVIOUSNOWFood items like rice, wheat, curd, paneer, flour,  pulses  including other cereals, honey, meat and fish (except frozen), non-ICU hospital rooms more than Rs. 5,000/day, Electric vehicles0%5%Hotel rooms, solar water heaters, maps, and charts, Bio-medical waste treatment12%Hospitals, tetra packs, fees charged by banks (cheques), services by RBI, IRDA, SEBI,18%Printing, drawing  and writing items, LED lamps, services such as works contracts(roads, bridges, railways, metros), Crematorium12%Cut and polished diamonds,0.25%1.5%Ostomy appliances, orthopaedic appliances, artificial parts of the body/implanted into the body, prepared/finished leaders, footwear and  its work5%12%Let us see some technical and fundamental analysis from the above-given table. The above table indicates that our dishes are going to be smaller, forcing us to eat less even if we are feeling hungry because the kitchen items, including food grains, are out of our range to buy because of the GST rate hike. Their prices will be increased. We see that the government is imposing taxes on power-driven pumps for farming, dairy machinery, poultry, and horticulture machinery, etc., that seem to be targeted at primary sector and farming. The government is not bothered to help the farmers during the worst monsoon season; instead, it thinks only about how to hike taxes on the products made by the farmers. It also gives us the message that without money, life is not going to be easy. Since you are taking tax on crematoriums, we are afraid to burn the dead bodies, and in the future, who knows if the bodies are going to be buried or thrown away due to lack of money. Again, we are also so afraid that we get ill due to the fear of government high taxes on hospital services. The application of GST is pushing healthcare toward a business model rather than a service-centric one.More Stories like thisMSACS ki warol laibak thibaniMar 8, 2023YUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022A steep rise of 12 percent in biomedical waste is unjustified and senseless, and it will raise the cost of running hospitals and clinics, thereby making healthcare more expensive. It will further result in higher charges for patients. It is not reasonable to burden patients with more charges in these difficult times. In the above table, the government is also imposing high taxes on printing, writing items, and other services. It means the government is targeting the youth of the country and their future through their education system. Is the government of this country against education and the youth? On the other hand, the government is imposing a lower GST tax on luxury items like gold and diamonds (1.5%) and a higher tax on essential food grains (5%), which means the government is promoting rich people. Are you pro-rich and anti-poor?   The price rise resulting from the GST rate hike is the same situation where the government is trying to kill its people, and at the same time, the people are not allowed to cry at all. Playing like a cyclic game, the government is giving a lot of welfare to the people through its schemes on one hand and then taking away from another hand (tax). In the table, we also see that the government has now hiked taxes on LEDs, electric cars, etc. but these items were promoted by the government with a promise that India would experience less power consumption and free air pollution, and be less dependent on petrol and diesel. What a U-turn on the government’s promise!Instead of trying to impose nationalistic feelings on us, such as hoisting the tricolour or attempting to divide our people based on religion, the government should first try to focus its attention on how to solve the economic depreciation. Iam not against it. Of course, there needs to be a strong feeling of nationalism among us. But without food and money, how can we survive? To live is the first priority. Let the people of this country survive happily rather than imposing and forcing them to do so. One can’t become a patriot simply by hoisting the tricolour, but doing one’s work honestly, loving its people and giving justice is true patriotism. Since you are imposing more and more taxes upon your people, we, the people, are facing a lot of hardships, and it is difficult to survive. It means you have no feeling of love for your people or patriotism. If the government had it, you might not have harassed your people. It is not possible to bear a feeling of nationalism if the people of the country are being tortured/harassed through some other means. Some days back, we heard that the government has exempted taxes on some of the Bollywood films like The Kashmir Files, Samrat Prithviraj, etc. which are being watched by the rich people but on the contrary, the government is imposing taxes on essential food and kitchen items.What is the reason that there is no space for taxes on big corporations and companies in this GST rate hike in 2022? The coming trend is that we, the people of this country, feel inferior to criticize the government, which is not a good sign of healthy democracy. The teeth of the judiciary system need to be sharp, thereby cutting corruption and injustices, and the wings of the media should be set free so that they can fly freely in the air to create a people’s democracy rather than sold news, or else it will be a dictatorship form of government. State-sanctioned news is maximum propaganda, and real journalism doesn’t need permission to show the truth. We live in a democracy. And in a democracy, we have the right to dissent. Let not the outside influences silence our voices. We need to stand up and raise our voice for a strong democracy. The voice of the people is the voice of God.Raising taxes on essential items will cause inflation to rise even further. India is dominated by poor and middle-class families. The rise in prices will not only affect the middle class, lower middle class, and poor, but it will also deter people from working in small businesses, entrepreneurship, and start-up business. Mostly above all is the timing where India is presently facing high inflation, high unemployment, and high rupee depreciation over dollars, i.e. roughly (80 rupees= 1dollar). We all witnessed that before 2014, the Indian economy was somewhat good and the value of the rupee was high as compared to its present worst condition. Ironically, it indicates that the government has no sources of income other than increasing taxes to run the country. At the same time, the government is promoting privatization by selling public sector units like banks, companies,  flights( Air India), airports, railways (which are on the way to being privatized), etc. Since, after all, there are no public sector units of the government, the private sector will play its monopoly and there will be no competitors. The private sector will do whatever they like to do in the future. We all see how these two network operators, Airtel and Jio, are playing a monopoly of their own since there are no other competitors in the market. Due to this, I do hope, the people of the country will again face the worst conditions.The Confederation of all India Traders (CAIT) has declared a nationwide agitation from Bhopal on July 26thand they demand to make GST rules easy. The CAIT claimed that bringing unbranded food and other products under GST tax would increase traders’ compliance burden. It means doing business is so complicated. The Indian economy is majorly driven by MSMEs and complicated GST compliance will discourage small businesses, having an adverse impact on MSMEs due to GST. It is unfair to expect MSMEs to make the transition to an online IT platform and expect no errors in return filing. It is an uphill task for the majority of MSMEs, who have little hands-on experience with IT solutions. The cost of deploying professionals is a major concern for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.I think, instead of promoting, the complicated GST will hurt the country’s small businesses, which have already been put on hold by demonetization. On the other hand, there will only be the rise of big corporates like Adani, Ambani, and Tata after all. They will play their monopoly. But the problem is that who will listen to our voices? We all know that in this post covid-19, there is the problem of rising prices all over the world, and the problem is more serious in India than anywhere else. It is just like a great curse on the poor. Rising prices of essential commodities, coupled with wage deflation and increasing joblessness, are pushing poor households in India to a point of distress. Cosmetic-like measures of the government are unable to address the situation. The deceleration in agricultural growth due to poor monsoon rains adds more headaches to this scenario too. It is high time to look into this tragedy of economic errors by the policymakers and the government together, or else it will aggravate the problem of price rises in the near future, which will again be very hard to survive.(Jayanta Sharangthem is a resident of Yairipok and loves writing on issues confronting the people)"

shady-role-of-eci-in-manipurs-electoral-process-a-systemic-failure-of-government,"One of the fundamental roles of the ECI is to guarantee that candidates who seek to contest elections meet stringent eligibility criteria.By Kaoba LuwangThe democratic fabric of India is woven together by the tireless efforts of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is entrusted with the solemn duty of ensuring that the world’s largest democracy conducts elections that are free, fair, and untainted. However, recent events have cast a dark shadow over the ECI’s reputation, as systemic failures due to corruption have emerged, posing a grave threat to the very foundations of Indian democracy.One of the fundamental roles of the ECI is to guarantee that candidates who seek to contest elections meet stringent eligibility criteria. These criteria, encompassing age, citizenship, and legal qualifications, are in place to safeguard the electoral process from unqualified individuals seeking power. A critical part of this process is the scrutiny of nomination papers filed by candidates, which is designed to identify any discrepancies or omissions that might compromise the integrity of the elections.Yet, the glaring failure of the ECI to properly scrutinize Kuki candidates with documented links to militant groups from Myanmar during Manipur Assembly elections raises disturbing questions about the commission’s commitment to its mandate. One of the candidates allowed to run early on was Pu L. Singsit, a leader of the Kuki People’s Front (KPF), who had previously been associated with the Kuki National Organization (KNO), a militant group advocating for an independent Kuki homeland.This lapse in judgment has rightfully drawn criticism from various quarters, raising concerns about bias and partiality within the ECI. Such incidents threaten to erode the faith of the Indian electorate in the electoral process and undermine the democratic principles upon which the nation is built.Furthermore, allegations of the involvement of Manipur legislators, particularly Kuki MLAs, with Kuki militant groups operating under the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement have added another layer of complexity to the issue. It is essential to question whether these legislators played a role in inciting violence to further their political agendas, highlighting the urgent need for a thorough investigation and a renewed commitment to restoring the integrity of India’s electoral process.The Manipur Political-Militant NexusManipur has faced decades of insurgency, with various militant groups seeking autonomy or secession from India. The nexus between some MLAs and militant leaders has been a longstanding issue, raising questions about the role of these elected representatives in perpetuating instability in the state. These connections are often based on mutual benefits, including financial support during elections and protection from the militants themselves.Several Manipur legislators, particularly Kuki MLAs, have direct or indirect connections to Kuki militant groups. These connections raise serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest and loyalties, which demand scrutiny:Thanglianpau Guite:President of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) and former MP candidate in Myanmar, Guite’s leadership of a militant group under the SoO agreement raises questions about his involvement in Manipur’s political landscape.Khenchin:Vice President and Secretary of ZRA, Chin’s alleged affiliations with an armed group operating under the SoO framework have raised concerns.General P. S.

Elected officials are expected to serve the interests of their constituents, not engage in deals with militant groups that undermine the state’s security and integrity. The involvement of MLAs in such activities erodes the trust citizens place in their elected representatives and the democratic process itself.Allegations of Corruption within the ECIAnother critical issue plaguing Manipur’s political scene is the allegations of corruption within the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ECI is responsible for overseeing free and fair elections in the country. When allegations of corruption within this institution emerge, it strikes at the heart of India’s democratic processes.Claims of manipulation of electoral outcomes through financial incentives, voter suppression, and electoral malpractices have been made. These allegations cast doubt on the legitimacy of election results and hinder the ability of Manipur’s citizens to elect representatives who genuinely represent their interests.The Importance of AccountabilityAddressing these interconnected problems in Manipur is vital for several reasons. First and foremost, the integrity of India’s democracy is at stake. A functioning democracy relies on transparency, accountability, and trust in the electoral process. When elected officials are alleged to have links with militants and when the body responsible for conducting elections faces corruption allegations, it undermines the very foundation of democracy.Moreover, the security of the nation is in jeopardy. Manipur’s instability has repercussions not only for the state but also for the entire country. The links between politicians and militants can facilitate illegal activities, including arms smuggling and drug trafficking. Failing to address these issues promptly risks being perceived as complicity by the highest authorities in the government, further eroding trust in state institutions.Implications and the Call for InvestigationThe implications of these connections are grave. Elected officials are expected to serve their constituents, not engage in deals with militant groups. Such alliances erode public trust in democracy and raise concerns about the security of the nation.Furthermore, allegations of corruption within the ECI compound these problems. Claims of electoral manipulation through financial incentives, voter suppression, and malpractices undermine the legitimacy of election outcomes. Trust in the electoral process and the democratic principles upon which India stands is eroding.To restore confidence in India’s electoral system and protect the nation’s security, a thorough investigation into these allegations is imperative. Those found guilty, whether within the political realm or the ECI, must be held accountable under the National Security Act. Infiltration within the government cannot be ignored, and failure to address these issues promptly could be perceived as complicity at the highest levels.The time has come for India’s democratic institutions to demonstrate their unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. The Election Commission of India must regain its tarnished reputation and ensure that the electoral process remains free, fair, and untainted. The fate of Indian democracy hangs in the balance.(Kaoba Luwang is a freelance. The opinion expressed here does not represent the views of TFM)"
police-memorial-unveiled-at-naptc-complex-in-choumoukedima,"“Despite what the Nagaland Police has achieved till date, there are still many things or works required to be done and that the same could be achieved only when the uniformed personnel are together in unity,” DGP Rupin SharmaBy Imna Longchar, TFM Nagaland CorrespondentNagaland’s Director General of Police (DGP), Rupin Sharma, on Saturday said that Nagaland police, which is one of the police forces in the country having “Presidential Colours” has a “glorious history” for a longtime.Speaking before the uniformed personnel and officers after unveiling the “Police Memorial” at the Nagaland Armed Police Training Centre (NAPTC) Complex, Choumoukedima, Sharma, however maintained that despite what the Nagaland police have achieved till date, there are still many things or works required to be done and that the same could be achieved only when the uniformed personnel are together in unity.Stating that the police memorial was an effort though different units have some form of memorial while most of the units observe their police commemoration day every year, the DGP was of the view that to commemorate the day with the units from all over the districts of the state, a centralized memorial for Nagaland police should be a feature for a state level day for which all should work together towards the same in identifying an appropriate location.The DGP, Nagaland, while citing that state-level police commemoration day is being observed by different states throughout the country, said that the observation of the day could be made a “grandeur affair” where all units of Nagaland police participate and celebrate the day together, an opportunity where all the uniformed personnel assemble together to show others in Nagaland and beyond that it is the “Khaki”, the uniformed personnel of Nagaland which binds them all together cutting across tribalism, clans, villages, and religion.Rupin Sharma added that for having a “central Nagaland police memorial”, his office would try to make out a method for which he requested the DIG (Training) and Commissioner of Police (CP), Dimapur, to identify a location that could be shortlisted for which from his office would try to see whatever necessary aid or help is required.He suggested that the memorials inscribe the names of the martyrs on a brass plaque for which something could be planned out by next year before the Nagaland police commemoration day by citing that the kind of memorials should not be only in stone but need to be in a “living moments” for those who had sacrificed their lives by coming out with booklets, pamphlets, or a book on Nagaland police with a brief account of the contributions made by the martyrs in the line of duty and their actual incidents which led to their “fall” that could set an example to the young jawans.Mentioning that the Nagaland Police has done “very well and very fast” in executing their duties for many years, Rupin Sharma said that the Nagaland Police is such including the jawans, all need to be “reoriented” themselves by stating that the basic training is good but adaptation to new technology and new methods of crime management needs lots of designed while he personally felt the need to do more on that aspect for which he expects all the jawans and the police personnel of Nagaland to take trainings very seriously.“I know we have not taken any recruitments for the last 3 or 4 years, but we are trying to bring out a syllabus for the fresh recruits and also will incorporate some new training methods,” he maintained while also adding that training curricula from the NC level up to SI, and inspector would be given for which all should be prepared.Besides this, Rupin Sharma disclosed that recently the parliament of India has introduced three new criminal laws for which he informed all the personnel of Nagaland police to be trained on the new laws as most of the laws and provisions are of the same but there are little changes in order to distinguish and understand as the unlike other departments, police department has to function according to the law.He urged the personnel including the jawans, officers, and senior officers to partake in the training for the new law to be given as these changes to be made are in the process.More Stories like thisPPFA appreciates Assamese society on CAA understandingMar 16, 2024‘Hamari Vaani’ for persons with disabilities foray into…Mar 8, 2024Distribution of PDS rice in Nagaland under scanner;

All the market places remained crowded and nobody adhered to covid protocol and safety guidelines.The state government, which was very proactive in instilling covid appropriate behaviours into people, also seemed to have lackadaisical approach to adopting covid control measures, like declaring specific geographic areas as containment or buffer zone to prevent local transmission and contact tracing to break chains of transmission, this time.For instance, a girl student of Central Agricultural University, Imphal tested covid positive on 14 July. Following the report, the dean of the university issued notice on 15 July requesting the students, teaching and non-teaching staff to strictly follow COVID-19 protocols issued by the Government of Manipur and urging them to avoid unnecessary movement outside the college, games and mass gathering.As per the notice, all exams will be conducted as per scheduled by following COVID-19 protocols.

He said there was a need to create “champions” from the state.Metha stated that Nagaland has the potential and scope and added that an investment of human resources is a must besides having best coaches, trainers, and including physiotherapists, and other support staffs.He also extended his appreciation to all sections of the Naga society especially to the sport fraternity to conclave together and to work as one.In his presidential address, Kesonyu Yhome (IAS), commissioner and secretary to Nagaland chief minister said that the Nagaland Badminton Association (NBA) is commemorating its 50th anniversary. He as the NBA crosses huge milestone, it also stands at a “crucial juncture” to revisit its efforts and dig deep to see if it has done justice to the opportunity given to it in steering the affairs of the sport.Over the years, few individuals have put in selfless efforts to take the NBA and the game of badminton to where it stands today, Yhome lamented that most of the players have been rather casual in their approach as according to him the “business” as usual approach would not quite fetch any individual “points” to take everyone any further for which he suggested for an “open mind” and also to welcome all genuine suggestions and inputs from those who love and understand the game.He went on to add that in order to understand the basic challenges, the NBA has been pursuing two critical components with the Nagaland state government with regard to infrastructure facilities and career opportunities for athletes where its was learnt that some “baby steps” have been taken but according to him there is lot of ground to cover and while assuring that the NBA would continue to take the ventures to their logical conclusion.Reminding that the 45th inter district and state open championship was held in the summer this year in Kohima, Kesonyu said the association consciously decided to segregate the “Masters Open” unlike earlier years in order to give dedicated focus importance to the young talents in the State who could potentially go on in representing the state as well as the country while also adding that NBA’s priority is always to “scout” and groom talents especially those players in the age groups of the under nine, eleven, and thirteen categories and the priorities not to “waver”.On the other hand, the NBA president and bureaucrat, Kesonyu Yhome, disclosed that the Master’s category is now a recognized format at all levels and therefore it is important that the association continue to promote the very particular sport (badminton) at all levels and for all ages while stating that it is the veterans who bear the guiding torch and light the path for all young talents to sail through.Mentioning that it is important that the sport is “marketed” for all ages in order to cultivate a “vibrant culture” of badminton in particular and other sporting disciplines in particular in the present Naga society, Kesonyu further stated that single’s category has been introduced this year so that “stars of yesteryears” could get an opportunity to polish their skills, improvise their fitness and potentiality to go on in participating in major events both at the national and international levels in “earning” a name or two for the state.A journey in Badminton in the state was shared by the first NIS badminton coach, Atu Pongener, while the NBA Golden Jubilee Coffee Table Book was also released as part of the grand finale of the said badminton championship."
brace-for-record-warmest-year-in-century,"With the prediction of exceptional warming this current year already hitting the headlines, the Manipur Government requires to study the process post-haste and formularise measures to meet any exigency from extreme weather events, such as the projected extreme heat this summerBy Salam RajeshIncreasing global warming has been altering the weather patterns, leading to anomalies in the temperatures and rainfall patterns, reads a recent report of the climate watch organization Climate Trends quoting reference from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The report specifically refers to global warming continuously pushing the mercury to new levels, indicating that ‘initially it was the maximum temperatures that registered the rise, but now minimum temperatures are also following the same route’. The diurnal temperature variation, which is the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, has decreased, the report stated stressing that February month this year witnessed the second highest minimum temperature in the month since the year 1901.The IMD weather chart for January and February (2024) indicated warmer months in the northeast region where the minimum actual winter temperature in January was 10.25 degrees Celsius against the normal 9.96 degrees Celsius with an anomaly of 0.29 degrees Celsius, while in February the minimum temperature shot up to 13.21 degree Celsius from the normal 12.66 degrees Celsius with an anomaly of 0.54 degrees Celsius.Things are not going to be smooth sailing for year 2024 by the nature of reports filtering in of possible extreme weather events, more specifically extreme heat waves this summer. Michael Le Page writing for the 29 February edition of the New Scientist journal last month quoted a scientific report by Ning Jiang et al. wherein it is being forecast that this current year 2024 would have a blistering summer under a strong El Nino influence.Climate model studying the process indicated several hotspots around the world that are going to experience record breaking heat this summer. The prediction is already there that the year 2024 will be the hottest ever in a century’s time. Areas in the southern parts of Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Far East, and the South America belt are going to melt under a blistering heat due to the El Nino influence.Quite distressing for the region in North East India is that the El Nino reach would likely impact the region, for the very reason that the Bay of Bengal along with the Caribbean Sea, the South China Sea, parts of Alaska and the Amazon Basin are being reported to have their hottest 12-month period on record this year, again due to the projected El Nino weather pattern.More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Michael McPhaden of the NOAA Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory (Seattle, Washington) reflects that based on the predicted forecast, the regions in the hotspots are at risk of weather extremes which would be quite damaging for human health, the natural environment and for the marine ecosystems located within the hotspots.One factor for the forecast all-time high in global temperature this current year is the warming caused by carbon emissions globally from fossil fuel burning, says Michael while hinting that coupled with the El Nino event, the world is going to boil this summer with the high possibility of extreme heat waves across the planet.In the face of the predicted climate-related disaster in the making presently, is the controversy surrounding the recently concluded global climate summit at Dubai (COP 28) which was marred by the host country avoiding serious discussion on fossil fuel reduction to address global warming and other climate related issues and concerns.A Climate Trends report on the 2022 Indian Heat Waves reflects that, ‘The heat wave affecting India from March to May 2022 was exceptional for its record temperatures, its early onset, its unusually long duration and the large area that was affected. It was responsible for at least 90 deaths, wheat crop failures, widespread power outages and 300 forest fires’. It is in this scenario that the year 2024 is set to brace for another disastrous extreme weather event where already many parts of the country are experiencing early summer beginning late February, prompting speculations of an impending calamity later this year.Meanwhile, the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals of the UN) chart for the Asia-Pacific region up to year 2024 showed a dismal performance indicating regression on the climate front (SDG 13 – Climate Action), while only SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) showed some sign of progress. This inherently showed how nations are not fully committed to climate action strategies and measures despite the increasingly evident extreme weather events during these past years.The IPCC (2023) quotes climate change is ‘altering the frequency, duration, and intensity of many types of extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall, and fire weather conditions’, while the organization warned in 2021 that ‘extreme weather events would increase in South Asia, including India, and that heat waves would become more intense and frequent in the 21st century’.During May in 2022 several parts of the country were lashed harshly by heat wave spells, forcing schools to shut for days as schoolchildren were being exposed directly to the extreme weather event. People living in marginal conditions without proper shelters are directly exposed to the harsh conditions, possibly resulting in deaths from the extreme weather event.On a rather negative footnote, exceptionally warming events are also impacting life forms other than humans, where ‘Rising temperatures are already driving mass mortality events, as well as the first extinction of entire species. Every degree of warming is expected to increase these losses and the impact they have on people’ (Living Planet Report, 2022).The statement resounds closely on the observation that, ‘Since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) the observed mean land surface air temperature has risen considerably more than the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature (GMST)’ (IPCC 2022: Climate Change and Land), thereby indicating that rising temperatures globally is set to impact negatively on all forms of life on Earth.With the prediction of exceptional warming this current year already hitting the headlines, the Manipur Government requires to study the process post-haste and formularise measures to meet any exigency from extreme weather events, such as the projected extreme heat this summer."

The current work includes his contributions in the quarterly journal E-CineIndia and textual representations of his close associations with the pioneers of Manipur cinema.Meghachandra KongbamMeghachandra Kongbam vividly described the five chapters of his book. The first chapter deals with the environment of cinema in Manipur before the advent of films in Manipur. The second chapter portrays the birth of Manipuri Cinema and the struggle of the pioneers. The third chapter focuses on the works of second-generation filmmakers of Manipur. The fourth chapter covers Manipuri Cinema in digital age. And, the final chapter brought out the issues of Manipuri Cinema in contemporary times.Reel Versus Real lives, skillful narratives, ban on Hindi films, creative outbursts: Prof MC Arun speaksProf MC Arun of Manipur University succinctly captured the imagination of the audience towards the author and the book. Narrating his close association with the author since childhood, Arun highlighted the author’s love for Manipuri Cinema in every close encounter with him.Drawing from the Hegelian analogy of the driving force of history as ideas every serious reader of the book could find out that the driving force of Manipuri cinemas is human emotions.  Arun compared Meghachandra’s style of writing with that of Gangumei Kamei and NK Sanajaoba where all of them picked up a particular person and skilkfully narrates the historical account of the social reality of Manipur through that person. Arun points out that through this book one could know the real story behind where a film based on Dr Kamal’s Madhavi was abandoned and not released till date. Stressing on the self-sacrifice of Madhavi in the actual novel and the self-sacrifice of Dhirendra in the reel Madhavi, Arun captured the audience’s attention by comparing Dhirendra of the reel Madhavi with RK Meghen who was also present in the book launch, on a lighter note.Dignitaries during the functionFurther, Arun stressed on the need to provide a free space in Manipuri cinema for creative outbursts which at the time is facing extreme censorship from the powers that be.Arun also spoke on an interesting story behind the ban on Hindi films by the armed political groups of Manipur. The ban on Hindi film started not as an act of defiance against Indianisation at the beginning. Rather, the ban on Hindi film started in the form of a homage to a “fallen son of the soil who hated Hindi film”. One particular armed political group appealed not to showcase Hindi films in the cinema halls of Manipur only till the days of mourning was over. However, the Assam Rifles retaliated with forced display of Hindi films with loudspeakers in their designated camps. Due to the alleged high handedness of the Assam Rifles, the armed political group of Manipur counter retaliated with a complete ban on Hindi films and the ban continues till date.M Joy Singh, IAS Commissioner (Art& Culture/IPR), President of Manipur Film Journal And Critic Association who presided over the event lamented about the decay of Manipuri cinema at the end of the innings of the 50 Years of Manipuri Cinema and hopes that in the coming new inning Manipuri cinema should surpass its past glory. The book launch received full packed attendance from different walks of life including scholars, film makers, artists, and film lovers."

Santa also highlighted that a main ward for Infectious Diseases will also be inaugurated within the month of September. He pointed out that the new ward will the change the game in tackling impending Covid -19 waves in the State. The new ward will unload the pressure of a new wave and make the hospital function stress free during the pandemic, he added.Responding to public allegations about RIMS having insufficient Operation Theatres (OTs), A. Santa said, the current number of fully functional OTs at the institute is 25 which include 5 modular operation among others. He stated, the present number of OTs at the institute is more than sufficient for patients and surgeons. He added that the number will also increase in the coming months."
alas-woe-to-manipur-nine-months-into-endless-killings-with-no-end-at-sight,"Many persons have been piqued and puzzled by the low key engagement of the Prime Minister (PM) in resolving the Manipur conflict. Criticism abounds that the PM has time to visit several temples across the country but has not found time to visit Manipur.By Ngaranmi ShimrayThree-quarter of a year into the Manipur violence since May 3, 2023 and there is still no signs of the Meitei and Kuki-Zo ethnic conflict abating. Home Minister Amit Shah came once and put in place various confidence building mechanisms notable among them are the deployment of thousands of armed personnel, assigning a special security adviser and constituting a Peace Committee.Unfortunately the Peace Committee has become a non-starter and no conversation between the two warring groups have started on the ground. With dialogue common grounds can be found and differences narrowed down. The inability to start talk has become the biggest hurdle towards finding a peaceful solution. There is an urgent need for both the centre and state governments to find ways to start the talks. This could be attempted by constituting a manageable Reconciliation Committee of only a handful representatives of both communities under the chairpersonship of a senior politician/retired government servant as interlocutor and hold the talks in a safe city/location outside the state.Many persons have been piqued and puzzled by the low key engagement of the Prime Minister (PM) in resolving the Manipur conflict. Criticism abounds that the PM has time to visit several temples across the country but has not found time to visit Manipur. It is indeed perplexing to understand the indifference and silence of the PM to the continued violence. Unable to decipher the reasons behind the silence, one is tempted to speculate why this is happening. Could it be perhaps a sense of disgust knowing that two brothers (Meitei and Kuki-Zo) within a family (Manipur state) are feuding and that the differences can be sorted out between themselves?The central intelligence apparatus perhaps feels that the primary problem is not poppy cultivation or cross border drug trade, but with Meitei anxiety to demographic changes in the state. It can be seen from the Census that the population of the backward tribes is increasing every decade compared to that of the advanced Meitei community. With the population tilted in favour of the tribes there is high likelihood of change in the power equation in the state. The faster rate of population growth of the Kuki-Zo tribes is suspected to be on account of migration from across the border.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024However this is not the case for the Nagas which is attributable to backwardness and poverty. Perhaps, the PM has been informed about this facts and that this is by and large a law and order problem which can be dealt firmly by the state government and contained by the security forces? Everyone knows that the society in the north eastern states are militant in nature and plausible solutions have political ramifications. Both parties are aggrieved and no one would like to listen to complaints and bickering, lest of all the PM. The leaders of both warring communities do not seem to have the right and positive attitude and frame of mind as of now and it is tempting to conclude that, at this juncture without change in attitude, nothing constructive will emerge.The Naga-Kuki ethnic conflict in the 1990s was sorted out after a few years of intermittent clashes that killed many, destroyed property and caused immense human sufferings and there are lessons to learn from this. In the Naga-Kuki conflict the disengagement between the two parties were preceded by eviction of several Kuki villages and a few Naga villages from vulnerable areas dominated by respective communities.The current stand-off between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo seem to indicate that the clashes have ethnic cleansing connotations, similar to that of the Naga-Kuki conflict, as continued attempts are made to achieve that goal in Moreh and the foothills adjoining the valley. There is a possibility that unlike the Naga-Kuki conflict, the current conflict between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo could be resolved on political lines? The probability of a political solution cannot be ruled out given that the core issue of facilitating the return of Kuki-Zo people to Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, remain intractable.How can an entire Kuki-Zo community who are citizens of Manipur and represents about 16% of the state’s population become persona non grata in Imphal? On a similar vein, how could the entire Meitei community be driven out of Churachandpur district? The current ethnic stand-off preventing the Kuki-Zo community from entering Imphal city is like a death-wish by the Meitei community, as any state government cannot function without the participation of a sizeable number of state’s population. By obstructing the return of the victims to Imphal and Churachandpur, the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities are unwittingly strengthening their own demands. Perhaps it would not be wrong to speculate that the Government of India is waiting for the right moment to prompt the Hon’ble Prime Minister to make a path breaking announcement that would resolve the Manipur crisis?Whatever the final outcome, people in Manipur are praying and hoping for peace to return. The conflict has not only affected the warring communities, but all the other communities living in the state. Daily wagers, farmers, internally displaced persons, school going children, job seekers and housewife are suffering in their own way including astronomical price rise of essential commodities.There is utmost urgency that the state government should work hard in close coordination with the Government of India to find a solution for peace to return to the state without allowing the conflict to fester. The onus for bringing back peace and communal harmony will always be that of the Chief Minister of Manipur and he cannot palm off his responsibility to the central government.(Ngaranmi Shimray is a New Delhi based activist.

treat-wildlife-crimes-at-par-with-crimes-like-drugs-smuggling-clandestine-arms-trade-lad-aaranyak-in-moreh,"Moreh ICP officials at India-Myanmar border town had been exhorted upon for unrelenting vigil against wildlife crime andburgeoning illegal trade in wildlife. Emphasis put on mounting vigil against wildlife crime along the international border areas.TFM DeskThe officials from various government agencies/departments that work under one roof and in tandem at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Moreh on the India-Myanmar border in Manipur as well as personnel from Manipur Police have been urged to treat wildlife crimes especially the burgeoning illegal trade in wildlife at par with crimes like drugs smuggling, clandestine arms trade which are threat to the national security and economy.“Wildlife crimes including illegal global trade in wildlife parts which transcends countries’ frontiers, is the 4th largest after drugs trafficking, weapons smuggling and human trafficking and must not be considered just a wildlife conservation related crime and all these are intricately related,” observed a team of resource persons from the Legal and Advocacy Division (LAD) of Aaranyak, a premier biodiversity conservation and research organisation, during a sensitizationprogramme held at the ICP, Moreh on June 23 (Thursday) afternoon.The programme which was held in collaboration with Customs Preventive Force and with support from US Fish and Wildlife Service. It was attended by 28 select personnel from various government agencies including Customs Department, Immigration Bureau, ICP, Land Port Authority of India and Manipur Police.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024“Given the complexity of various dimensions of wildlife crimes and the global network of these criminals, it is not possible for any single agency to check it. Hence Aaranyak which believes that prevention of wildlife crime is essential for effective conservation, strives to facilitate synergy in action among various agencies in dealing with wildlife crimes,” stated the Aaranyak team of resource persons in a press release.Making a presentation in the workshop, Jimmy Borah, Senior Manager of LAD in Aaranyak, flagged why forces deployed on border areas of the country are required to be highly vigilant against the wildlife crimes that poses grave threat to the biodiversity as well as economy of the country.He cited reports about linkage of wildlife crimes with the illegal trade in drug and weapons that also involve insurgents and hence said transboundary movement of illegal wildlife must be prevented as much as possible. He highlighted the way land, sea and air routes are used by wildlife criminals in transshipping wildlife across the globe besides flagging the provision of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as well as CITES convention in dealing with wildlife crimes.Ivy Farheen Hussain, a Project Officer in Aaranyak, in her presentation highlighted the local perspective of wildlife crime and roles of various stakeholders in preventing and mitigating it. She presented how efficient site security, raising awareness of various stakeholders and efficient prosecution of wildlife criminals can have a combined impact of checking wildlife crimes.Presenting findings of a study conducted on wildlife crime taking place across India-Bhutan border in western Assam areas, the Aaranyak official drove home that mounting vigil against wildlife crime along the international border areas is of much importance.Noted among those attended the workshop were T Baite, Manager of ICP, S K Gauate, Superintendent of Customs, ICP, Y K Anand Singh, Immigration official, Elangbam Dayananda Singh of Customs Preventive Force, RK Gunadhar Singh, an Inspector in Customs Department."

pinjang-village-in-noney-district-gets-a-new-primary-school,"After being engulfed by ethnic clashes in the 1990s, peace has since descended on  Pinjang (Gangluan -IV)  in Noney District. Generations of youngsters have however suffered due to the lack of affordable educational facilities with no viable school in the village. Now, the Learn for Life Foundation partnering with the Archdiocese of Imphal is ensuring that the children of Pinjang and neighbouring villages have better opportunities to access quality education.By Rucha DeshpandePinjang (Gangluan -IV) in Noney District is a village of about 600 persons hailing mainly from the Rongmei Naga tribe.  During the 1990s, the village was severely impacted by the Kuki – Naga ethnic conflict. Many unfortunate persons from both communities from Pinjang and neighbouring villages unfortunately perished in the violence. As a result of this, the Kukis moved out of the village to neighbouring villages. Since those dark days, relations between the two communities have considerably improved with many progressive steps for reconciliation taken by community leaders on both sides.Most of the inhabitants of Pinjang are subsistence farmers, many of who hail from the BPL category. The COVID pandemic and consequent lockdown further impacted the livelihoods of families, many already in indigent poverty. A major issue in the area for decades is the lack of any good schools as a result of which generations of children have lost out on an education. In 2016, an attempt was made by a James Thaimai, a local entrepreneur, who sought to bridge this gap by starting  a primary school at Pinjang. The school temporarily came under the Salesian Fathers and came to be called Don Bosco School as a branch of the school of similar name in nearby Khoupum. However, due to various factors, the school was turned over to the Archdiocese of Imphal.  As it was extremely difficult to run the institution due to financial constraints the school once again came under the control of the village community. With little funds even to meet operational costs, the already dilapidated buildings with mud floors, tin sheet roofs and bamboo matting walls fell further into disrepair.  The worst impacted were the school children, who, despite the pathetic infrastructure, clung tenaciously to this only hope for access to education.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024Local villagers express their gratitude to the Assam Rifles which has helped build toilets, contributed roof sheets and books for the library. They are also grateful to Sunbird Trust, a Manipur based NGO, for immense support to the school through providing solar lighting and blankets for the children.In January 2022, through the support of generous donors in the United States  and  LearnforLifeFoundation.Org and its founder Thomas Thekkethala, work commenced on building a brand new and permanent school building. Thekkethala is an entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist with over twenty-five years of experience in financing and leading technology companies in the US.  Gaikhangam, former MLA of the Nungba constituency arranged for the levelling of the land for the new building. Thanks to a committed and resourceful contractor, the work progressed very quickly. “Members of the community are all working very hard with the building contractor to complete the building by the end of April 2022. The communities have provided the manpower to carry building materials to the site and haul sand and stone up the unpaved road to the school in their own 4×4 trucks. Every participating community member has put their differences aside to help build the school for their children” added Fr Varghese Velickakam from the Archdiocese of Imphal.In the coming years, the school will be able to serve more than 300 children in Classes KG to Class VI.  There are also plans to raise a new hostel to facilitate access to the school from neighbouring villages. Mr Thaimai says that the local community had almost lost hope and their faith in society to educate their children. Now, he says, they are rubbing their eyes in disbelief as the new school building has literally risen like a phoenix from the dust. He conveys on their behalf their deepest gratitude to the unseen and most generous donors from far away and Thomas Thekkethala, founder of the Learn for Life Foundation.  The  next generation of children at Pinjang and neighbouring villages now have a better chance of education, empowerment and consequent employment. Fr Velickakam expressed the gratitude of the Archdiocese of Imphal to the Learn for Life Foundation and the generous donors for their sponsorship of this critically needed primary school. He says that with this contribution, the Diocese will take the baton forward and run a viable school for the children. The school will serve children  of all communities without preference on grounds of tribe or religion. He expects that the school will serve as a hub for bringing back true peace and reconciliation to this conflict affected area and also contribute to national integration. He also expressed his gratitude to the Assam Rifles and to Sunbird Trust for their support for the school. Thomas Thekkethala, has expressed his satisfaction at the speedy pace of work. He believes that the donors can have a deep sense of satisfaction at getting the opportunity to positively impact the lives and destinies of hundreds of lesser privileged children for years to come.The inhabitants of Pinjang and neighbouring villages, it seems, can hope again!!(A resident of Pune, Rucha feels privileged to have been able to spend over two years in a school in an idyllic village in the hills of Manipur.

st-demand-issue-positive-discrimination-affirmative-action-and-the-cracks-within,"India’s reservation policy has spawned forms of conflicting categories of the ‘exploiter’ and the ‘exploited’, the ‘dominant’ and the ‘subservient’ as if these binaries exist in a permanent cycle sans the dynamics of wresting political power at play.By Dhiren A. SadokpamIn recent times, the political elites of three primary ethnic groups in Manipur are caught in a whirlpool of anxiety propelled by palpable dissonance in political objectives. This anxiety is not necessarily triggered by the differences in speculative autonomy-demands or even demands based on administrative separatism.The main anxiety has been caused by the way how the communities have effectively understood the political ideas behind positive discrimination, affirmative action or what in the Indian subcontinent is being referred to as the reservation policy of communities that have apparently lagged behind in holistic development. The most recent play-out that has triggered the spells of anxiety and tension has been the demand of a community considered advanced in comparison to its neighbours, to be included in the Scheduled List of Tribes in India.While the proponents of the demand and those opposing the same have resorted to socio-political and historical reasoning, both the parties seem to have skipped re-looking at either redefining or refining the concepts they would love to toy with. One is not sure if both the conflicting parties have understood that India’s reservation policy presupposes a social fact – centuries of oppression of one group by another. This presupposition assumes a determinate but constant ‘unchanging oppressor and oppressed’ and ‘advanced’ and ‘backward’ communities. The ‘constant’ is supposedly created by a social order that determined identities of each castes, communities and tribes. This has spawned forms of conflicting categories of the ‘exploiter’ and the ‘exploited’, the ‘dominant’ and the ‘subservient’ as if these binaries exist in a permanent cycle in all societies sans the dynamics of wresting political power at play.For the mainland India, these terms are defined in relation to the hereditary caste order whereas for Northeast India, the same has been defined by amorphous understandings of communities guided by colonial agenda of the British whose administrators first chose to categorize people from the mixed-prism of the caste order or an anthropological understanding of a system which they considered was durable.It is against this backdrop that United Naga Council, Manipur (UNC) and the Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM) have raised objections to the Manipur High Court’s directive to the Government of Manipur to send its recommendation for the inclusion of Meetei Community in the list of Scheduled list of Tribes to the Government of India. The directive of the high court was passed on March 27.Strident Voices and Social TensionThe UNC stated that “the Meitei/Meetei community of Manipur is an advanced community of India” with their language, Manipuri (Meiteilon) listed in the Eight Schedule to the constitution of India.“They are already protected under Constitution of India and categorized as (i) General (ii) Other Backward Classes (OBC) and (iii) Schedule Caste (SC),” said the UNC.UNC termed it irrational that the High Court of Manipur directed the Government of Manipur to recommend for inclusion of Meitei/Meetei community in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) list of India, “negating the sole objective of scheduling group of people for protective discrimination as ST in the Constitution of India”. The Naga body has strongly condemned and called the high court order “inane” for making “such imbecilic recommendation despite strong opposition from Scheduled tribes of the state”.More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024The common refrain and rationale behind the objections raised by both UNC and KIM has been rubbished by the proponents of those demanding a Scheduled Tribe status for the Meetei community. One strident voice has been that of the Kangleipak Kanba Lup (KKL). KKL has critiqued the objections in their own characteristic way stating that the demand for the inclusion of Meetei in the Scheduled list of Tribes in the Constitution of India is not aimed at grabbing “jobs” either from the Naga or Kuki communities of Manipur. It has asserted that the demand is based on safeguarding their “little bit of land” now confined to less than 2000 square kilometers out of the 20,000 square kilometers of the entire state of Manipur.The KKL has made it clear that the Naga and the Kuki communities need not fear about grabbing “their job reservation quotas currently enforced in Manipur which will remain status quo”. The organization also unequivocally asserted that the UNC and KIM have “no birth right” to deny any other scheduled tribes of India that job opportunity.The KKL had a message for the UNC too. It reiterated that the Manipuri Language being classified as scheduled languages of India under the Eight Schedule has nothing to do with the classification of the Meetei as a scheduled tribe of India. “Anyway Manipuri language is not confined to the Meeteis only but serves as a Lingua Franca amongst all the tribal communities of Manipur be it between the Nagas and the Kukis but amongst their various sub-tribes also”, it pointed out.Moreover, the UNC has also been reminded that it was Th Muivah, the top National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) leader who had stated that “only the Nagas and the Meeteis are the indigenous peoples” of Manipur. KKL asked, “So what is the idea of joining hands with the Kukis to block the way for the survival of the Meeteis under the Indian Constitution”. To the question of Meeteis being more advanced than the other tribes of Manipur, KKL asserted that it has nothing to do with genealogy but “mode of production” experienced by the communities.The Meetei community began to practice settled agriculture and had more time to concentrate on arts, culture and literature while the hill tribes hitherto used to follow a different form of agriculture “before switching to poppy plantation” in recent times that had made them “all become rich”, said KKL.The organization winded up their statement on a harsher note stating that it would be wrong on the part of both the Naga and the Kuki communities to consider the Meetei community as their “common enemy or else will be constrained to  oppose every move or demand made by any tribal group either Naga or Kuki”.The exchange of statements may not lead towards a reconciliation on the sensitive topic. As the articulation of the issue by those supporting the demand for inclusion of Meetei in Scheduled Tribe list up the ante on their movement, the objections by Naga and Kuki tribal bodies may get shriller by the day.Empowerment and Social JusticeIn all these voices, what has been missed is a dispassionate inter-community/ethnic group deliberation on what would be the best option for all communities to progress and under what protective or empowering mechanism. While the fact of discrimination cannot be denied in one’s everyday experience, ethnicization or communalization of the issue would only create unbridgeable distance between communities. Under such circumstances, one will not be able to project the fact that there are no permanent oppressor and permanent oppressed or instil the fact that the idea of permanent and constant binaries will lead to over-generalization of a theoretical framework to achieve quick practical results.What is of utmost importance now is truly and honestly grasping the fact that emancipating the socially underprivileged and the marginalized irrespective of community or tribal affiliation or within the same community is a move towards social justice. While doing so, one should not forget that the idea of empowerment of the individual has a far greater value and virtue than a protective mechanism that tends to perpetuate redundant binaries or historical contradictions.Here, it should also be noted that India’s reservation policy emerged out of a deep flaw in understanding the complex relationship between the conceptions of the ‘cultural/social’ and the ‘economic’. Having said this, elsewhere, this writer had also argued that the stereotyping of the Meetei as a Hindu society both within Manipur and outside, in the image of mainland Hindu ethos and practices has manufactured the idea of the ‘constant exploiter’ and the ‘constant exploited’ in Manipur.While Hinduised Meeteis have been identified with the former, all other non-Hindu communities are shown as ‘exploited’. Such is the handiwork of those who harp on the ‘politics of divide’ and benefit from it; and endorsed by the ‘ignorant other’ who is happy to own up anything that comes closer to the intolerant and imagined pan-Indian vision.(Dhiren A. Sadokpam is Editor-in-Chief, The Frontier Manipur. This article was first published by EastMojo under the title ‘ST demand for Meetei: First, acknowledge the cracks within’)"

Ask Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus and he will answer in the affirmative. The university professor turned revolutionary banker believes that the human race should not only dream about a safer world by reducing global warming, wealth concentration and unemployment, but also work in that direction with personal and collective capacities.In his latest book titled ‘A World of Three Zeros’, Prof Yunus proposes a new economic system focusing on every human being as an entrepreneur in the making. He believes that humans are not born to work only for someone else, but they possess unlimited creative energy to sustain themselves if proper patronages are accorded in a dignified manner. Once a human being is encouraged to get appointed under the conventional economic arrangement, his/her creativity is thoroughly destroyed.Once a teacher in Chittagong University, Prof Yunus pioneered the concept of microcredit & microfinance and later founded a bank with all differences in 1983, where many usual policies were challenged. Dedicated to the poor, mostly women, Grameen Bank of Bangladesh offers loans with no collateral and even enjoys a nearly 100% recovery rate. The unique bank directs their employees to go to the people and unlike the conventional banks, it encourages the women borrowers to own shares.Prof Yunus treated borrowers as the real owners of the bank and himself as an employee. The new-found bank with all its successful parameters drew the attention of world intellectuals and finally the creator and Grameen were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for extraordinary efforts to alleviate poverty in Bangladesh. He is also honoured with several high-profile international awards like Gandhi Peace Prize, United States’ Presidential Medal of Freedom, Karl Kübel Prize, etc. His book titled ‘Banker to the Poor’ narrates his sour & sweet experiences and also elaborates his idea of banking with benefits to the society.Prof Yunus recently graced the first Bodoland International Knowledge Festival held in Kokrajhar (administrative headquarter of Bodoland Autonomous Region), where he emphasized on empowering women by turning them into entrepreneurs. Citing the example of 10 million Grameen women borrowers, he commented that if they could become entrepreneurs, then anybody can emerge as an entrepreneur (if she/he is not compelled to be a job seeker). The focus of any government should be to create entrepreneurs, but not job holders, he asserted.Organised by Bodoland University with active support from the Bodoland Territorial Region government, the knowledge festival (27 February to 2 March 2023) focused on implementing sustainable development goals 2030 in BTR and the world at large. Various issues, deliberated and discussed in the festival, included science & technology, indigenous knowledge systems, women empowerment, child rights & protection, peacebuilding, good governance, communication & media, behavioural change & communication, human rights, sustainable agriculture, climate justice & action, quality education, health & wellbeing, art & culture, youth entrepreneurship, intellectual property rights, trade-commerce-investment in BTR, etc.The festival was also addressed by BTC chief Pramod Boro, Bhutanese diplomat Jigme Thinlye Namgyl, philanthropist Padmashri SB Dholakia, creative engineer Sonam Wangchuk, popular film personalities Vivek Oberoi & Sonu Sood, Assam assembly speaker Biswajit Daimary, State minister UG Brahma with a number of vice-chancellors of universities. More than 300 invited delegates from across India and 35 international delegates from 14 countries are participating in the festival, where 10,000 students, academicians, researchers, development practitioners, government officials, politicians, entrepreneurs, farmers, SHG members were present as participants.Besides addressing the knowledge festival, Prof Yunus also spoke at Bodoland College and Bodoland University. Later he addressed the students and teachers of  Rongia College and Gauhati University. Prof Yunus had an intensive exchange of thoughts on education with the vice chancellors from ten Assam-based universities in a special session. Prior to his departure to Dhaka, I had an opportunity to meet the soft-spoken, simple and smiling gentleman, who gave me a signed copy of ‘A World of Three Zeros’. As usual we had a long chat on varieties of issues including his invention of social business, a financial exercise where the goal is assumed not to maximize the monetary profit but doing something good for the society.Many may doubt the sustainability of such a business, but Prof Yunus argues that all people have two dimensions in them, selfishness and selflessness.  In each person both selfishness and selflessness exist in varying ratios. Selfless side is not recognized within framework of the business theory. It is left to charity.Prof Yunus included this dimension of human beings in the business theory by adding the concept of social business, defined as a non-dividend business dedicated to solving social problems in a sustainable way. That becomes the big door for creativity of human beings to address all human problems in a sustainable business way. He agreed the mainstream media should (could) have been a social business where it is not run for maximizing personal profit. As a social business the net profit of a media house should be ploughed back into the business to achieve the goal of the media to keep the public informed without fear or favour or desire to enrich the owners.(Nava Thakuria contributes to various newspapers of India along with several media outlets based in different parts of the world, including The Frontier Manipur.)"
a-call-for-hard-negotiations-to-eliminate-illegal-poppy-ganja-plantations-in-manipur,"A concerted effort is not only a step towards lasting peace but also a means to address the root causes of the region’s instability. It is a call to unite and work together for a brighter and more peaceful future for Manipur.ByThangjanganba LuwangThe time has arrived for both the public and stakeholders of Manipur to unite in their demands and negotiate for the complete eradication of illegal poppy and ganja plantations from the face of Manipur. This pressing issue demands our immediate attention and collective action.Negotiations with the Meira Paibis:The Meira Paibis, a formidable collective of Manipuri women, have recently come under scrutiny due to allegations of their involvement in monitoring the movements of security forces in the region. While the Meira Paibis assert that they do not object to the security forces’ operations within the state, they harbor deep-seated suspicions concerning the contents of vehicles and the intentions of individuals passing through the area. These concerns arise from claims suggesting that Assam Rifles vehicles might be engaged in transporting weapons for Kuki militants. Additionally, they accuse the Assam Rifles of providing assistance to these militants in the form of provisions such as food, clothing, and shelter.While these suspicions may be contentious, they are not entirely baseless. Manipur’s history has been marred by human rights abuses, and there have been instances of security forces operating with impunity. In this context, the skepticism displayed by the Meira Paibis is not only understandable but also indicative of a broader trust deficit between the residents and the security forces.Recent reports suggest that India’s Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah, has urged the Manipur government to ensure that the Meira Paibis do not hinder the movements of the armed forces. Whether the Meira Paibis will heed this request remains uncertain. However, their position provides a valuable bargaining chip for a negotiation with the central government, one that could potentially contribute to lasting peace in Manipur.Should the Meira Paibis decide to reevaluate their present stance and cooperate with the government’s request for withdrawal, they have the opportunity to enter into negotiations with the central government regarding the complete eradication of illegal poppy and cannabis plantations in Manipur. By advocating for the removal of these illicit crops, the Meira Paibis can fortify their position in these negotiations, working towards the betterment of their community and making a positive impact on the broader region.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024Negotiations with the Village Guards and Volunteers:Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s recent call for the surrender of looted police weapons is indeed a commendable step towards restoring peace and stability in the state. The recovery of over 4,000 stolen firearms and a significant quantity of ammunition is undoubtedly a pressing concern. However, it is essential to recognize that the looting of police weapons is a consequence of the violence that erupted in May 2023, rather than the root cause. To achieve lasting peace, we must address not only the symptoms but also the underlying issues that fuel unrest in Manipur.One of the fundamental issues contributing to instability in the state is the proliferation of illegal poppy and ganja plantations. These illicit activities serve as a source of income for organized crime and have contributed to the current social instability of Manipur. To effectively combat this problem, Chief Minister N. Biren Singh should consider launching an aggressive campaign to eradicate these illegal plantations. By doing so, the government can cut off the financial resources available to armed groups involved in the ongoing ethnic clashes.Most importantly, we must acknowledge the presence of armed civilians who have taken up arms to protect their communities amidst ongoing conflicts. It is also crucial to understand that these civilians, including village guards and volunteers, have resorted to arming themselves in response to the violence that erupted in May 2023, rather than being the root cause of the issue. While the effort to recover stolen police weapons is a positive step, it may not address the underlying problem we currently face.Both stakeholders and the general public of Manipur should negotiate with the government solely aimed at completely eliminating illegal poppy and ganja plantations in Manipur. This represents a practical and logical way forward that goes beyond mere  surrendering of weapons.In conclusion, the time has come for hard negotiations in Manipur. These negotiations should involve key stakeholders, including the Meira Paibis, village guards, volunteers, and the government, with a primary objective of eradicating illegal poppy and ganja plantations. This concerted effort is not only a step towards lasting peace but also a means to address the root causes of the region’s instability. It is a call to unite and work together for a brighter and more peaceful future for Manipur.(Thangjanganba Luwang is a concerned citizen, a freelance-writer and truth seeker.

the-flammable-mixture-within-the-naga-political-cauldron,"The level of contradictions and antagonism within the projected Naga conglomerate are much higher than the level of antagonism between proponents of Naga ‘territorial integrationist’ nationalism and neighbouring tribes/communities in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam.By Dhiren A SadokpamSometime during the last week of October, 2019, many keen observers of the political dialogue between the government of India and Naga negotiating groups were expecting the final settlement to the decades old Naga issue. With the reports of all decks cleared for inking the final agreement between Naga groups and the government of India, there were also wild speculations being churned out both by the informed and over-enthusiastic sections of the society.Most of these speculations were based on the “fear of the unknown” rather than a well formulated and meticulous culling of information already available in the public domain. The situation was further compounded by spreading of conjectures with an attempt to knowingly or unknowingly influence public opinion, especially in the states of Nagaland and Manipur.What one noted then was that most of these speculations were burdened with the pressure generated by flippant generalization of key indicators without properly digesting the dynamics of the phenomenon right under their own noses. The unfolding situation called for a clear analysis of Naga peace talks with concrete frames of reference – or what has been often dubbed as “ground realities” in common parlance.There are self-conferred social scientists, political analysts and many motivated individuals who had grossly misread the whole process of the Naga negotiation while others have inadvertently mixed up the process of “talks” with the process leading to the “final signing of the agreement”.Nothing else explained why these constituencies had collapsed the two as if they were  one with specific reference to the Naga peace deal.  Many from the national as well as the community of observers, analysts and media also have not properly taken note of the key principle followed by the then government of India’s interlocutor for the Naga talks RN Ravi – “one process and one solution”. How RN Ravi could not complete the set task will need another space/time to ponder upon.The modalities under “one process and one solution” during RN Ravi’s stint as the interlocutor meant that the government of India would ensure efforts were put in place to unify all those engaged in the peace talks as one entity. In simple words, it was more or less envisaged that NSCN (I-M) and Working Committee (WC) of Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) would be on board as one group in the days to come and before the actual signing of the agreement. RN Ravi envisioned no two separate signing of agreements with two groups. How the NSCN (I-M) and Working Committee (WC) of Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) are brought together as one was left to either the maneuvering power of the government of India or the self-realisation of all the Nagas as one permanent conglomerate bounded by a single contiguous political territory.As this writer had on earlier occasions mentioned, another plain reading of the events that took place in the last leg of the political negotiation indicated that while the process of working out the “competencies” and unifying process goes on, there may be enough elbow room to reposition respective views on who would represent whom and what would be the content of the final pact. As this process continued, the government of India was expected to consult all stakeholders including representatives of the states of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.However, recent dynamics do not bode well for the future of the Naga issue. There has been continuous duel of words between those who want to ink the final pact with the issue of Naga National Flag and Yehzabo (Constitution) resolved as demanded by NSCN (I-M) and those who want to close the chapter on the prolonged negotiation without emphasizing on the two demands. Since then, much waters have flown down the bridge.In the backdrop of such unfolding situations, the Nagaland Tribes Council (NTC), comprising of all recognized tribes of Nagaland state, with its headquarters in Kohima on June 1, 2022 called upon NSCN (I-M) to be transparent and to put the “competencies” that it often talks about in the public domain.In a hard hitting observation, NTC unequivocally and with a shade of sarcasm stated that the political negotiation between the government of India and the Naga negotiators has reached its “silver jubilee and that the people cannot wait any longer”.More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024The NTC stated that the government of India is absolutely clear on its parameters of negotiations with the understanding that was reached on October 31, 2019 and therefore it is incumbent on the NSCN (I-M) to take a call without wasting any more time.It may be recalled that the NSCN (I-M) on September 11, 2020 informed that the “Indo-Naga political talks” has reached a critical stage. The group said that the Framework Agreement and the competencies were being worked out with “outside the box” approach towards a solution. “Honourable, acceptable and early solution that is inclusive can only be achieved through the basis of Framework Agreement and competencies being on the verge of completion”.The NSCN (I-M) in recent times had emphasized that the Framework Agreement mentioned the sharing of sovereign power. The group’s supremo Th Muivah also stated that Nagas and the rest of Indians will coexist as two entities sharing sovereign power which will be defined in the competencies. Muivah said that in the competencies, “the government of India recognizes the territories of the Nagas – land and all the natural and mineral resources on the surface and beneath of it belong to the Nagas”.READ:https://thefrontiermanipur.com/government-of-india-misinterpreting-what-have-been-mutually-agreed-upon-th-muivah/Despite this clarification, the NTC, the council that represents only the recognized tribes of Nagaland seems to insist the NSCN (I-M) make the complete “competencies” public. How will making the competencies public expedite the final inking of the settlement pact remains to be adequately deconstructed.NTC also took a dig at the performance of the Core Committee on Naga Political Issue (CCoNPI) under the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA) government, the “opposition-less government”. NTC observed that CCoNPI tends to “misuse its role” while projecting itself to be the indispensable broker between the centre and the Naga negotiators.NTC also objected to CCoNPI’s apparent plan to apprise Assam chief Minister and NEDA convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma on the outcome of May 28, 2022 meeting between NSCN (I-M) and the CCoNPI so as to take forward the process of negotiation.WATCH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-ow1IBlUSo“We have the official Naga negotiators, namely, NSCN (I-M) and WC, 7 NNPGs and we too have a legitimate state government having equal status as Assam has. The NTC rejects the modus operandi of the CCoNPI as though the Naga negotiators do not have access to GoI through the official emissary and as though the state of Nagaland is secondary to any other state” said the NTC and warned the CCoNPI not to over indulge or to expose the competencies on the negotiating table sacred to the Nagas.NTC also reacted to one of the resolutions adopted by the United Naga Council’s (UNC) Presidential Council held in Imphal on May 27, 2022 and asked what will UNC gain if the period of political negotiation is extended. “Such senseless resolution exposes the ground realities that the loss and the suffering of the Nagas of Nagaland is the gain and enjoyment of the Nagas in Manipur”, said NTC in an unbridled expression and exposing the flammable mixture within the Naga political cauldron. NTC said it detested the attempt of political group to curtail or intimidate the stakeholders from expressing opinions or observations. “Such attempts are alien to our culture”, added NTC.The statement issued by NTC assumes significance in the backdrop of uncertainties that have enveloped the ongoing political negotiation between the government of India and the NSCN (I-M) in recent times. The apparent impasse set in motion by the issue of the group’s demand for Naga National Flag and Yehzabo (Constitution) and subsequent prolonging of inking the final pact will continue to spur comments and statements even if NSCN (I-M) had termed such comments and statements as “outrageous”. At this juncture, the decades old Naga political issue and the final inking of the pact seem to be heading towards a new direction predictably challenging. In several public and private meetings with political observers and public leaders, this writer has, over the last one decade, been arguing that the level of contradictions and antagonism within the projected Naga conglomerate are much higher than the level of antagonism between proponents of Naga ‘territorial integrationist’ nationalism and neighbouring tribes and communities in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam. It remains to be seen how the current government of India’s interlocutor to Naga political talks, AK Mishra faces the emerging contours of the political negotiation.ALSO READ:https://thefrontiermanipur.com/intemperate-language-used-by-nagaland-bjp-ministers-npf-leader-rattles-nscn-i-m/(Dhiren A.

quest-for-special-status-saddling-with-administrative-and-autonomy-mechanisms,"Special Status deceptively projected as Autonomy, Devolution of Power and Administrative Decentralization can be either an end to the struggle for bigger political status or the beginning of extending the administrative power of the Union Government over the states and regions in India.By Dhiren A SadokpamManipur’s civil society organisations in recent times have started reposing their ‘faith and belief’ in the power and the attractive sparkle of‘Special Political Status’. This new found faith and belief comes against the backdrop of ostensible hiccups in the more than two-decade old political negotiation between the Nagas and the government of India on one hand and the government of India scrapping Article 370 of the Constitution that granted Special Status to Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 on the other hand.Article 370of the Constitution of India is described as a “temporary provision” that grants the state of Jammu and Kashmir a special autonomous status within the Indian union. Under article 370(1)(b), the Union Parliament can only make laws for the state, “in consultation with the Government of the State,” on certain matters that were specified in the Instrument of Accession – namely defense, foreign affairs, and communications. Other matters in the legislative subject lists could apply to Jammu and Kashmir only with the “concurrence of the Government of the State” through a presidential order. Article 370(1)(d) stipulated that other constitutional provisions may be applied to the state from time to time, “subject to such modifications or exceptions” made by the president of India, also through a presidential order, as long as they did not fall within the matters referred to above and except with the concurrence of the state government.READ:https://indiankanoon.org/doc/666119/Article 371Ain the meanwhile is aSpecial Constitutional Provisionwith respect to the State of Nagaland that says no Act of Parliament in respect of religious or social practices of the Nagas, Naga customary law and procedure, administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Naga customary law, ownership and transfer of land and its resources, shall apply to the State unless the Legislative Assembly of Nagaland by a resolution so decides.For the moment, we can take a break from discussing Article 370, Naga political settlement or even Article 371A and now focus on some key issues raised while staking claim to greater autonomy by way of seeking a “Special Status” for the state of Manipur.Special Status, Special Category Status or Special Constitutional ProvisionBefore we embark on a discussion on the set topic, let us be clear that the Constitution of India providedspecial statusthrough anActthat has to be passed by 2/3rds majority in both the houses of Parliament whereas thespecial category statuswas granted by National Development Council, which is an administrative body of the Union Government.For example, Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed aSpecial Statusas per Article 370 and alsoSpecial Category Status. But now that Article 35A has been scrapped and it has become a union territory with legislature, special category status does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir anymore.As per the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, 11 states namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttarakhand were granted special category status. Special Category Status for plan assistance was granted in the past by the National Development Council to the States that are characterized by a number of features necessitating special consideration. However, following the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission, the Special Category States ceased to exist.READ:https://www.mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2018-pdfs/ls-11122018/106.pdfThe preceding cursory bits of information make it succinctly clear on what is the working and executable ideas ofSpecial Status, Special Category Status or Special Constitutional Provision etc.These terms are not theoretical or philosophical ideas by any stretch of imagination as any unscrupulous observers would like all to believe. While the terms mentioned here need further dispassionate-scrutiny in the light of bigger concepts likeAutonomy, Devolution of Power and Administrative Decentralizationetc., which had been invoked at least in theSixth Schedule [Articles 244(2) and 275(1)] of the Indian Constitution.READ:https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S6.pdfDemands for ‘Special Political Status for Manipur’A popular perception that continues to trigger the quest for aSpecial Political Statusin Manipur is more or less guided by the rejuvenated confidence that numerous issues confronting the state can be comfortably resolved if the State of Manipur enjoys special political autonomy and also improve the political relation with India.On January 19 this year, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) submitted a representation to Prime Minister  Narendra Modi reiterating its demands for ‘Special Status for Manipur’ and amendments to the Constitution of India.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024COCOMI apparently believes that granting special status to Manipur will correct “historical blunders” that the government of India had inflicted on the state in the past leading to trust deficit and political armed violence.The representation recounted the history of Manipur — from being an Asiatic kingdom to being under British rule after 1891and also detailed how Manipur was “controversially merged” to India in 1949.READ:https://thefrontiermanipur.com/cocomi-submits-representation-to-pm-modi-demanding-special-status-for-manipur-amendment-of-constitution/Recalling the events between 1949 to 1972 — from Part C State (comprising both the former chief commissioners’ provinces and some princely states) to statehood, the representation maintained that as a consequence of these events, the statehood accorded to Manipur could not meet the aspirations of the people.“The post statehood period saw increased political movements with different methods, including armed struggles. The quest for past political and cultural glories, defending human rights, establishment of bicameral legislative system with an aim of providing proportional representation to minor, micro ethnic communities/tribes, a permit system to protect indigenous people self-guarding the territorial integrity were dominant in the public consciousness, ” said the representation submitted to the Prime Minister.The representation further demanded amendments to Article 2 and 3 of the Indian Constitution so as to ensure Manipur’s territorial integrity and to assuage the feelings of hurt and neglect.“A new contour for reshaping the Centre-State relationship need to be put in place not only to meet the modern challenges but also to assuage the feeling of hurt of its citizens. A provision for Special Status for Manipur in the constitution and a provision in Article 3 that in respect of Manipur, any changes will be with the concurrence of the Manipur State Legislative Assembly will do wonders to restore the historical pride of the people of Manipur and will have a salutary effect on the various challenges which is cropping up and staying which are inimical to the inclusive development in the state,” COCOMI proposed.The CSOs’ conglomerate also urged the Prime Minister that in order to mitigate the various challenges that Manipur has been facing, the proposal be considered in the larger interest of the state and the country.It may be recalled that COCOMI had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on December 27, 2020 when he visited Manipur and had demanded the granting of ‘Special Status’ to Manipur as per the resolution of the ‘Public Convention for Special Status to Manipur’ held on December 26, 2020 at GM Hall, Imphal.A snap observationWhile the points raised and demands made by COCOMI can be truly appreciated given the exclusive set of political, social and economic conditions that Manipur has experienced in the last seven decades as the primary rationale, it would not be much of a problem for any informed individuals to dissect the issues related to“Special Political Status”in conjunction with bigger concepts likeAutonomy, Devolution of Power and Administrative Decentralization and Mechanismsetc.,Masked by the new idioms of modern institutions, the ethnic communities in Northeast India had been demanding assortment of administrative mechanisms to serve their own community interests. Several autonomy movements came up as early as 1950s and the same was carried on till date with the objectives to carve out new States, Union Territories and Autonomous District Councils. The earliest formation of these autonomous councils include North Cachar Hills (Dima Hasao) Autonomous Council (1951) and Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (1952).These movements and even the formation of Autonomous Councils have their stories of success, failure and points of negotiation. Till today, attempts are being made to initiate division of administrative institutions and citizens’ privileges on ethnic lines across the region. This is turning out to be a never-ending story even in a State like Manipur even though the current demand is not directly related to seeking autonomy in the form of autonomous councils.Along with the autonomy demand, the region has also seen mushrooming of new identity assertions. While one may see ethnic assertions as positive search for self-rule, the inter-ethnic conflicts take us towards a different reading and understanding of the concept of Autonomy. Often these conflicts arise out of control over land: each of the communities requires not only to claim as their own but also to have governing and administrative mechanism in operation. While larger ethnic communities take to consolidating their hegemonic presence in the region, the smaller communities are constantly in alliance and in the process of re-negotiating their identities. More than once this writer has argued that most of these renegotiations/reconfigurations are seemingly headed towards a larger process of political formations. These are some intriguing cobweb of political practices clearly visible now and may linger on till a holistic vision of the region is being carved out of collective anxiety.It is indeed interesting to observe how the quest for Autonomy has been unfolding around the world since the 1940s when decolonisation process began to raise its novel heads.  Decolonization of Asia and Africa between 1945 and 1960 is truly significant in this context even though autonomy movements are not necessarily analogous to movements for total self-determination or freedom or sovereignty. Plainly defined, Political Autonomy is the ability as a group of people with a territory by invoking and practising self-rule sans the control of a higher level of government.However, what we understand in the Indian context is hinged to the granting of “Special Status” to states and regions and in effect, empowering or disempowering them to exercise their wisdom as an autonomous political entity. When one executes a textual analyses of the language used in theSpecial Provisionsgiven in the Constitution, it is not difficult to find out that there is hardly any effort given to translate these provisions to enable self-rule. One finds them as mereAdministrative Decentralization and Mechanismsto prolong an uneasy political relationship through the all-encompassing process of spawning little dependencies inside one huge political entity. Here, it would be noteworthy to point out that the push for more political and economic freedom can be propelled either by sheer financial resource-weakness of those seeking greater autonomy while acknowledging the presence of richly endowed natural resources in their respective regions.The quest and desire for autonomy or evenAutonomy, Devolution of Power and Administrative Decentralization and Mechanismscan be either an end to the struggle for bigger political status or the beginning of deceptive yet real mechanism of extending the administrative power of the Union Government over the states and regions in India. The inability of theSpecial Constitutional Provisionwith respect to the State of Nagaland in the form ofArticle 371Ato solve the decades old Naga issue is a clear pointer to this fact.While seeking‘Special Political Status’for the State of Manipur, it is indeed a necessity to dissect all existing or that ceases to exist models/provisions in an effort to at least minimise possible political inabilities. It is to be noted here that all the mechanisms inherent in the so called ‘special status’ and provisions devised so far since the adoption of the Constitution of India, one can well read the role of the a nominal head appointed by the Union Government – the Governor, embedded within the same constitutional texts and powers conferred to him to act as the agent of the Union rendering the concept of autonomy ambiguous and irrelevant. At best, most of these provisions are purely administrative mechanism and not autonomy mechanism.(Dhiren A. Sadokpam is the Editor-in-Chief, The Frontier Manipur)"
naga-students-rally-for-permanent-peace-in-manipur,"NSF held a rally in solidarity with people of Manipur for permanent peace in the state. NSF demonstrated its resentment against the government of India for failing to end the cycle of violence and take up necessary steps to promote reconciliation.By Imna Longchar, TFM Nagaland CorrespondentVoicing out with a slogan that read “Stop playing with politics” and demanding permanent peace in Manipur, a demonstration was held in Nagaland on November 9. It was organised by Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) under the aegis of the North East Students’ Organization (NESO).Vice-president, Naga Student’s Federation (NSF), Mtseisuding, who was part of at the sit-in in front of the Raj Bhavan, Kohima, stated that all have been gathered to offer prayers in remembrance of neighbouring state, Manipur, where violence has already claimed countless lives causing immeasurable sufferings for the last six months. He said NSF and the NESO are calling for peace as well as demonstrate its resentment against the inadequacy of the government of India for failing to end the cycle of violence and take up necessary steps to promote reconciliation.On this, Mtseisuding said the NSF believed that it is their moral responsibility to raise its voice against the conflict and to advocate “peaceful resolution” to “bloodshed and violence” so that humanity prevail across all socio-economic, political, and cultural spectrums in the entire Northeastern region.He said the ongoing conflict has caused immeasurable pain and suffering, not only to those involved but also to the entire region. Many lives have been lost, homes destroyed, and the social fabric of the region torn apart, he said adding that the ongoing violence threatens to erode the peace and stability that should be the birth right of every citizen.“It is disheartening to note that despite the pleas and cries for help from the affected communities, the Government of India has been disappointingly inactive in ceasing this violence. The Northeast Region has often felt neglected and marginalized in the broader context, and the lack of a swift and meaningful response to this crisis has only prolonged the ongoing violence”, the NSF vice-president said while calling upon all the stakeholders to prioritize “peace and dialogue” as the only way to “resolve” these crises.Mtseisuding on behalf of the NSF also urged the conflicting communities to come together and to seek common ground for lasting peace in the region while also appealing to the government of India (GoI) to take immediate and concrete steps in intervening in to the matter thereby providing necessary support and resources to facilitate the peace talks and other peace building efforts.More Stories like thisPolice Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024PPFA appreciates Assamese society on CAA understandingMar 16, 2024‘Hamari Vaani’ for persons with disabilities foray into…Mar 8, 2024Later, he reiterated that the NSF’s call for peace in Manipur resonates not only with the Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) but with all those who yearn for a harmonious and prosperous future as all stands together, as citizens, and as responsible members of the society, to demand an immediate end to the violence and a genuine commitment to peace from all stakeholders.The NSF vice-president further urged all to work together hand in hand in order to build a future for the children where they could grow up in a region of peace and prosperity at the sametime reminded that peace is not just the absence of differences but rather the presence of justice, equality, and respect for each other, with a hope and a vison that it is beyond one’s reach if everyone is determined and be united.Secretary general, NESO, Mutsikhoyo Yhobu, delivering his solidarity message has demanded to the government of India (GoI) not play “politic over innocent’s lives” but to show sincerity on the ongoing violence in Manipur and to take necessary actions to stop all violence while adding that the “demonstration” is being held across the northeastern states in order to call for peace amongst the “conflicting groups”.He later urged the prime minister of India to speak up on the same issue.Coordinator, NESO, Ejanthung Ngullie, has urged for participation of all individual as neighbourhood to foster peace and work towards ushering peace in the state of Manipur, and also expressed his condolences for the loss of the countless lives.Former NSF general secretary, Imtiyapang Imsong, in his address has appealed to all the concerned citizens across the northeast states to forge a “unified stand” and to voice the desire of the region for peace and normalcy in the state of Manipur and the entire northeastern region while stating that the region’s people would not remain silent until peace is brought in Manipur.Also speaking was the former NSF president, Kegwayhun Tep, who expressed his concerned for the students whose career were affected by the conflict.He further said that Naga people and Manipur would always remain neighbours, and therefore, lasting peace and normalcy is paramount to progress collectively in the region.Earlier, the sit-in demonstration was chaired by NSF general secretary, Chumben Khuvung, started with an invocation prayer proposed by NSF secretary education, Temjentoshi, while the invocation was pronounced by NSF auditor general, Kawoka Awomi."

elections-or-festival-of-money,"The candidates and political parties having tons of black money (wonder where it is generated from) are distributing it freely in the form of cash, liquor or rations. Our gullible public is just making the most of it from all the candidates in their constituenciesBy Col Shireesh Bhatia (Retd)Having been closely involved for the first time in any kind of elections, I have been amazed and scared seeing the blatant use of money to buy votes during the Great Indian Election Festival. Despite all checks by expenditure monitoring teams put in place by the ECI, the candidates and political parties having tons of black money (wonder where it is generated from) are distributing it freely in the form of cash, liquor or rations. Our gullible public is just making the most of it from all the candidates in their constituencies.More Stories like thisMSACS ki warol laibak thibaniMar 8, 2023YUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022Recently, I met a friend of mine in Manipur who was cribbing about how the daily wagers working for the construction of his hospital have taken off for their respective villages or, in this case, their constituencies, leaving their work which is feeding their families. He explained to me that they are getting more money out of the intending candidates/ candidates in the electoral fray by going around their offices/ homes, so why would they want to work at this time.The ECI’s expenditure monitoring guidelines are good only if there’s no black money in play. Also, no candidate has been spending money beyond the limit laid down, simply because the period covered for the expenditure is from the date of nomination to the date of declaration of results, which is generally around a month only. More so, the actual expenditure is monitored from the nomination till the date of polling, which is just about 20 odd days, as in the current case of Manipur. However, the money being distributed by the candidates is not done in public places, so there’s no monitoring the same.Our public, despite being aware that the elected candidate shall first collect back all his or her expenditure before even thinking of using the Local Area Development Fund for the public. For a short term gain we are selling our votes. I came across a few people who said very unequivocally that they will vote for the candidate who gives them the highest amount. A candidate, no names, has gone around distributing cash to the tune of Rs 10000/- door to door (in the urban area) in the run up to the elections, starting nearly 6-8 months earlier. The capability of the candidate holds no meaning in our kind of democracy. Qualifications, background of political or social work or experience of public administration does not matter to our public. Hence, we get the kind of people that we see today as elected leaders, viz, contractors, uneducated and uncouth people. That actually sums up the elections in Manipur or for that matter, all over India, the elections have now become The Great Indian Election Festival or Festival of Money."

will-the-existing-vaccines-work-against-omicron-health-ministry-answers-2,"Can the currently used diagnostics methods detect Omicron? How concerned should we be about the new VOC? Will there be a third wave? The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday issued answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the new variant of COVID19, classified as Omicron (B.1.1.529) by the WHO on November 26, 2021.TFM DeskAs India reported cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, many are searching for information about the new variant. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday issued answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the new variant of COVID19, classified as Omicron (B.1.1.529) by the WHO on November 26, 2021.These FAQs have been uploaded on Ministry of Health website:Will the existing vaccines work against Omicron?While, there is no evidence to suggest that existing vaccines do not work on Omicron, some of the mutations reported on Spike gene may decrease the efficacy of existing vaccines. However, vaccine protection is also by antibodies as well as by cellular immunity, which is expected to be relatively better preserved. Hence, vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease, and vaccination with the available vaccines is crucial. If eligible, but not vaccinated, one should get vaccinated.What is Omicron and what makes it a variant of concern (VoC)?It is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has recently been reported from South Africa on 24th November 2021 called as B.1.1.529 or Omicron (based on Greek alphabets like alpha, beta, delta etc). This variant has shown a very large number of mutations, especially more than 30 on the viral spike protein, which is the key target of the immune response.Given the collection of mutations in Omicron, which earlier individually have been associated with increased infectivity and/or immune evasion, and the sudden rise in the number of positive cases in South Africa, the World Health Organization has declared Omicron as a Variant of Concern (VoC).Can the currently used diagnostics methods detect Omicron?The most accepted and commonly used method of diagnostic for SARS-CoV 2 Variant is RT-PCR method. This method detects specific genes in the virus, such as Spike (S), Enveloped (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) etc to confirm the presence of virus. However, in the case of Omicron, as the S gene is heavily mutated, some of the primers may lead to results indicating absence of the S gene (called as S gene drop out). This particular S gene drop out along with the detection of other viral genes could be used as a diagnostic feature of Omicron. However, for final confirmation of the omicron variant genomic sequencing is required.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024How concerned should we be about the new VOC?WHO declares a variant as a VoC after assessment when there is increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics. (Source: WHO)It is important to highlight that Omicron has been declared VoC based on the observed mutations, their predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion, and preliminary evidence of detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, such as increased reinfections. The definitive evidence for increased remission and immune evasion is awaited.What precautions should we take?The precautions and steps to be taken remain the same as before. It is essential to mask yourself properly, take both doses of vaccines (if not yet vaccinated), maintain social distancing and maintain good ventilation to the maximum possible.Will there be a third wave?Omicron cases are increasingly being reported from countries outside of South Africa and given its characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries including India. However, the scale and magnitude of rise in cases and most importantly the severity of disease that will be caused is still not clear. Further, given the fast pace of vaccination in India and high exposure to delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity, the severity of the disease is anticipated to be low. However, scientific evidence is still evolving.How is India responding?The Indian government is monitoring the situation closely and is issuing suitable guidelines from time to time. Meanwhile, the scientific and medical community is geared up for developing and deploying diagnostics, carrying out genomic surveillance, generating evidence about viral and epidemiologic characteristics, and development of therapeutics.Why do variants occur?Variants are a normal part of evolution and as long as the virus is able to infect, replicate and transmit, they will continue to evolve. Further, not all variants are dangerous and most often than not, we don’t notice them. Only when they are more infectious, or can reinfect people etc they gain prominence. The most important step to avoid generation of variants is to reduce the number of infections.https://twitter.com/COVIDNewsByMIB/status/1466376403553701890?t=brM5ZWF_In_qH5FOMXceAg&s=19"

good-mental-physique-and-wellness-for-prosperous-new-year-2023,"The biggest misconception in the country is that some people perceive that mental Illness happens to the weak/abnormal people only. Sometimes we tend to believe that if we are strong physically, we should be strong mentally.By Deepika MayanglambamIf we consider on the possible economic losses due to mental health condition as per the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimate of One Trillion USD worldwide during 2012-2030. As per the reports of the National Mental Health survey (NMHS) it has been found that 14% of the population in our country need mental health professional help.We have witnessed a drastic and unexpected increase in the number of people suffering from mental illness after the Covid-19 pandemic, it has also been reported that one in seven person is suffering from different types of mental illness, for instance, depression, anxiety etc.ANXIETYhas become a ubiquitous form of mental illness which we come across in our regular life.  An anxiety can occur in any phase in a lifelong process. Overall anxiety is somewhat a person faced in different angle and scenario. Furthermore, people having anxiety issue finds hard to overcome their fear from mild to longer period of stress or panic.But yes, anxiety can be effectively treated by different approaches such asSELF-TREATMENTwhich includes physical activity, a healthy diet, regular sleep, and relaxation exercises may all help to reduce anxiety. Joining a support group may also help. Basis the severity of the anxiety levelSEEKING MEDICAL CARE,reaching out to a mental healthFIRSTAIDER,and taking up a Consultation with a mental health professional can be immensely helpful.The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) released data on suicidal deaths in India in August,2022 and the figures were startling. A total of 1,64,033 suicides were reported in the country in 2021 which is an increase of 7.2% in comparison to the previous year in terms of total numbers. The number reported is the highest ever recorded in the country since inception of reporting of suicides by the NCRB in 1967. This is a genuine cause of concern especially the unfortunate student suicides in India which recorded an all-time high in 2022. As per reports by NCRB, student suicides saw an increase by 4.5 percent as compared to 2021.As per the NCERT survey, it has been found that 81% of students feel anxious because of academic stress and competition. It is very much necessary to find solutions.We strongly believe there may be different reason of the reported suicide cases, may be personal, financial but the numbers are depicting that the MENTAL ILLNESS is becoming a big reason due to lack of proper treatment and awareness. The mental health experts in the country says that up to 15% people suffering from mental health have suicidal tendencies.It is often observed that, when one wants to express their state of mind and the issues about mental health they are often met by mockery and ridicule.Data shows clearly that more men go to the doctor for mental health related issues compared to women. Deaths due to heart attacks increased by 6 times in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020, and it has also been pointed out that EMOTIONAL STRESS DURING COVID is one of the reasons of the cause of number of deaths reported.More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024Before solving it, we must admit to the existence of the problem, and believe that anyone can have mental health issues. In some mental health related cases many people cannot clearly convey their problems as it is frowned upon by outsiders. But it is vital for the overall wellbeing to address mental health issues.The mental health awareness has also increased in the last few years, date shows that young Indians are actively taking care of their mental health, in the last one year there is 44% increase in consultations: PRACTO. The consultation consists of people from the age group of 25-34 age group. Where 61% are male and 39% are females who are going for the treatment to doctors or therapist for their mental health issues. This is indeed a good sign.The younger generation population have started to understand about the mental health issues as an important health aspect.Many schools in the country have also started giving attention to the mental health to the students especially after two years of virtual schooling.The biggest misconception in the country is that some people perceive that mental Illness only happen to the weak people/abnormal people. Sometimes we tend to believe that if we are strong physically that we should be strong mentally. For one’s good mental health, identifying emotions and mental state is a worth needed.Mental health also affects important organs and gland of the body, more than 56 million Indians are suffering from depression*Depression is common caused. PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) is a mental health condition triggered by a terrifying event, causing flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety and the “survey indicated that 28.2% of population [that participated in a survey] suffered from PTSD during lockdown in India”, said Anita Khokhar. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in India was found to be 32.4%, and mild and moderate depressions were present among 14.4% and 6.4% of the study population, respectively.It’s okay not to be okay. So going to therapy is not a sign of weakness. Being able to recognize or want help is a sign of high self-awareness and choosing to seek help is incredibly brave.The ultimate fact is anybody can become a victim of mental health issue. And solving it is a unique journey for everyone, there is no uniform treatment for mental health issues.Sometimes lifestyle changes help but professional help is always recommended. With the new beginning of the year, the following self-assessment can be considered.Are you overworked and overthinking?Do you get angry very fast?Ever felt low in life that nothing interests you?Do you feel still and lethargic?Do you spend too much time on TV or online?An honest introspection will do wonders in your life this prosperous new year 2023.(Deepika Mayanglambam is the founder of FREEDOM FROM MENTAL ILLNESS.

banyan-trees-on-national-highway-39-nh-2,"Plant two trees in two proper places; make it grow and survive; before we cut down a tree grown in an improper location;                        to conserve the nature and save the mother earth.By Sanasam Basantakumar MeiteiMore Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Trees not only adds scenic beauty to the surrounding environment but also gives healthy air to the living beings specially to the human beings. The banyan tree is known as the National tree of India. It is also considered a sacred plant, and hence worshipped by the Meitei/Meetei community in Manipur. The scientific name of this tree is “Ficus benghalensis” and it gives us a lot of medicinal benefits to us. During arthritis, the banyan tree can be used as it has anti-inflammatory and analgesic property, which helps to manage the pain and inflammation. The fruits of the banyan tree can be used to reduce stress. The bioactive compounds present in the banyan fruits also help in enhancing memory and lower the risk of seizures during panic attacks. Being a big tree it gives lot of shade during a hot sunny day and hence the place near the tree is a good place for a break.Such a useful tree is a banyan tree but what shall we have to do if it were grown in a place where it may disturb to the different movements of the mankind. What will happen if it is going to be a cause for many deathly accidents? The question is whether we are to make it still grow in the same place or are we to fell down the tree or is there any other means? Felling down of the trees is against the law. The Indian Forest Act has laid down its own rules and regulations against felling of trees. According to this act, the penalty for felling a tree is a sum of Rs. 10,000 or 3 (three) months imprisonment. But for cutting down trees that are blocking our way, whose branches are spreading to our house or blocking hoardings, we need to take a clearance from the Forest department.Are we to cut down those trees just because we have the clearance from the Forest Department? The answer is a big “NO.” Then what do we have to do as an environment conscious citizen? What precautions do we need to take up before felling a tree? Let’s remember there is a saying that “plant two trees before cutting down a tree”. So in order to cut down a tree lets plant two trees in a proper place so that we conserve the biome and also we make a population growth for the particular plant. Lets take an example of the decades –old scores of fully grown Banyan trees on the Hyderabad – Bijapur highway. These decades – old Banyan trees are on verge of being cut down for the proposed road widening of the National Highway. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) apparently has completed widening of road from chevella towards Bijapur to a large distance where several such huge trees have already axed. But another way is to move the odd giant trees instead of just cutting them down. However the question is about the fund which will be needed to relocate the giant trees. Keeping a view in Manipur’s context few banyan trees are still there right is the middle of the National Highway -39 (NH – 2) which are located on the way from Manipur University Gate to the Standard Robarth Higher Secondary School. Some of the trees even look too old that they are almost dying. The biggest challenge right in front of us is whether to cut down these Banyan trees or whether to persevere these old guards of the environment.Change is a natural process; living things will grow old and it will naturally die; it is the law of the nature. No one can escape from the law of the nature. Now our concern on the Banyan trees on the National Highway – 39 / NH – 2 is: shall we wait for these trees to die naturally and bear the hurdle these trees causes in our movement. When these trees die naturally; repair the highway once again. Another option is: Plant two more trees for each corresponding Banyan tree which are suppose to fell down. Let these newly planted trees grow well to survive and then cut down those Banyan trees which blocks our way.Discussing on the advantages and disadvantages of the two options we can say that the first case may look conserving the nature but on the other hand because of these trees many accidents may occur which may cost our lives as these old giant trees are just standing right in the middle of our way. The big rotten roots may give crack on the road which again will lead to accidents of the automobiles. What we observed right here is one way the growing trees conserve the nature and the environment and gives fresh air needed for the human beings and is advantageous for us but at the other side there are chances which may cost our live. Let’s have a look in the second option of planting two trees correspondingly for each tree which are supposed to fell down. First of all we know that we are increasing the number of trees by one for each tree and which will be benefited double times in the future and then as we are planting in a proper place it is going to add the scenic beauty of the nature and will be more benefited to the people. The repairing of the Highway (after the Banyan tree die naturally) will not be required. Thus we are benefited in all dimensions. And why not we think for a decision which will make us better and more benefited in the long run. Life is so precious and let us all think for a win – win situation. The win-win situation right in front of us is: plant two trees in two proper places; make it grow and survive; before we cut down a tree grown in an improper location; to conserve the nature and save the mother earth.(The writer is a social activist and an entrepreneur)"

collective-history-and-construction-of-aggressive-other,"In the worldview of the Meeteis, two mountain peaks in Manipur, Koubru and Thangjing have been depicted as their prime deities indicating control over marked spatial entities. This narrative have been misread by many as one of the many ways to legitimize historical claims over lands despite emerging contestations.By Dhiren A SadokpamIn the last six decades, the presence of the so called Northeast India is felt through violent episodes witnessed since the dawn of India’s independence. The violence that one refers to here can be more or less categorized into – violence between the state and the non-state actors, violence among the non-state actors themselves, ethnic violence spurred by  religious and cultural antagonism and inter-state conflicts. However, there are many layers to violence and conflict. At times, a conflict between two parties is marked by more than one issue of contention. Shifting triangular relationship amongst Manipur’s Meeteis, Nagas and Kukis in recent times highlight this dynamics.Multiple identity articulations are the most dynamic aspect of Manipur’s contemporary political and cultural history. They also shape the contours of the representative institutional politics and civil society movements. Many resort to recovering past memories with newly constructed image of the “aggressive other”. This has spawned writings (and politics) on the issues of indigenous identity, land and territoriality, and in recent times, on illegal migration.In some cases, the construction and re-construction of the ‘origin myth’ are generated through traditional practices of identifying geographical areas that are of significance to the communities.Along with the generation of ‘origin myth’, communities have also been engaged in ‘sanctification’ or ‘de-sanctification’ of these spatial demarcations and converting them as representations of revered deities or sheer territorial dominance.  For instance, the Meiteis over the ages have attached cultural and religious significance to two mountain peaks: Koubru and Thangjing. In their worldview, the two peaks have been depicted as prime deities indicating control over marked spatial entities. Such narratives have been misread by many as one of the many ways to legitimize ‘historical’ claims over lands despite emerging territorial contestations.However, any serious engagements with the aforementioned issue does not have to end with social media posts and counter views of the same on the same media followed by allegations and counter-allegations. One knows well enough that the contours of emerging territorial contestations by tribes and communities can only be understood through a serious engagement with a “history acceptable” to all.More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024What seems to be part of an emerging bigger discourse on the history of communities, women, gender, and culture, many are hesitant to project a durable vision of the collective past, the present and the future.More than once, this writer has argued that this hesitation is borne out of the intricate relation between current ethno-political situations on one hand and the “ought to be of our history” on the other.The consequential fallout of these engagements have been disturbing if not disastrous. While rejecting the imposed grand history and trying to write “our own histories”, most of the projects end up rejecting each other’s history. The impact of this process gets well reflected in the spawning of political missions at cross purposes in the Northeast region.Elsewhere, one has argued that a conscious glimpse at some of the engagements by those who are participating in the enterprise of writing public or private “histories” of Manipur throw up some very interesting developments.Some proponents of the “nativist” approach attempt to set the record straight. They say that the ‘fabricated history’ of Manipur has misled many people and the same needs to be countered and rectified. While arguing for an acceptable approach, the political content of their works can be gauged from a stance taken after reviewing events celebrated as markers years ago. From within the same school of thought, there are those who not only seek the “truth” but also make an attempt to see the “truth” in the light of liberty, equality and fraternity akin to collective wisdom.This writer had on numerous occasion observed that the rise of the so called “nativist” history was made possible via the exclusion by the dominant discourse in the history of the Indian subcontinent and the rejection of the same history by the “nativists” themselves. The current engagement with “our little histories” seems to suggest that many had opted for a path quite distant from how history is derived or how memories are revived. All seems to be setting their eyes on a path that seeks to know how history has been ‘represented’.Many rarely adhere to the norms of writing a collective history and are too deeply entangled in their own specified or projected “uniqueness”. Are they getting closer to the correct interpretation of meanings of the past through multiple claims to sources? Answering this question has less to do with trusting or rejecting the sources or taking any given historical texts including those texts countering the dominant representation as self-evident.While making an attempt to construct meanings to our history, one cannot just pile up a corpus of data based on given idea of trust/distrust or acceptance/rejection binaries only. There is not just one ‘story’ but many to be told and recovered. How one presents or represents them is much more important than what and how the historians or even the social media activists find them. If one wants to retrieve or recover collective history, one does not need to construct the image of the “aggressive other”.*The same key concepts and ideas presented in the first part of this work have already been touched in the Introduction to “Northeast India: A Reader” published by Routledge India and Edited By Bhagat Oinam, Dhiren A.

cannabis-eradication-the-missing-piece-in-manipurs-war-on-drugs,"The unchecked cultivation and distribution of cannabis result in substantial revenue for criminal networks, further complicating law enforcement efforts. While the government’s focus on tackling opium poppy cultivation is undoubtedly essential, it’s equally crucial to address the issue of cannabis cultivation.ByThangjanganba LuwangIn a recent announcement, the Government of Manipur took a commendable step towards combating drug-related issues in the state. They reconstituted the Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) in response to a communication from the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) regarding the ground verification and destruction operations concerning illicit Opium Poppy Cultivation. The move is laudable as it reflects the government’s commitment to tackling the drug menace effectively. However, one glaring omission has left us pondering – why has the government excluded the destruction of cannabis from this initiative?Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana or weed, is one of the most widely abused illicit substances in India, and Manipur is no exception. Its cultivation and use pose significant health and societal challenges. Cannabis contains psychoactive compounds, primarily THC, which can lead to addiction, cognitive impairment, and mental health disorders, especially in young people. The unchecked cultivation and distribution of cannabis also result in substantial revenue for criminal networks, further complicating law enforcement efforts. While the government’s focus on tackling opium poppy cultivation is undoubtedly essential, it’s equally crucial to address the issue of cannabis cultivation.Besides the menace of opium, cannabis cultivation has been a persistent problem in Manipur, contributing to various socio-economic issues. Its production and distribution not only fuel the drug trade but also have adverse consequences on public health, leading to addiction and related health problems. Excluding cannabis eradication from the scope of the reconstituted ANTF may inadvertently send the wrong message – that this illicit drug is somehow legal or less harmful or less deserving of attention. Public must note that cultivation of cannabis for medical or recreational use has not been legalized in Manipur.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Moreover, it is noteworthy that the earlier “War on Drugs” campaign initiated by the Government of Manipur had conspicuously omitted addressing cannabis plantations in the hills of Manipur. The State Government had focused primarily on  the destruction of poppy plantations but conveniently ignoring illegal cannabis or ganja plantations. There has been no reported destruction of ganja or cannabis plantations in Manipur under this campaign, a fact that can be easily verified.The government’s decision to exclude cannabis eradication from the ANTF’s purview raises questions about the comprehensiveness of its approach to addressing the drug problem in Manipur. While opium poppy cultivation is undoubtedly a serious concern, it should not overshadow the need to address the cannabis issue effectively.To tackle the drug problem comprehensively, it is essential for the government to broaden the scope of the ANTF’s responsibilities to include cannabis eradication alongside opium poppy destruction. This inclusive approach would send a strong message that the government is committed to combating all forms of illicit drug production and trafficking.Moreover, it’s important for the government to consider preventive measures and provide rehabilitation and support services for individuals struggling with drug addiction. Combating the drug menace isn’t solely about destruction but also about addressing the root causes and providing assistance to those affected.In conclusion, while we applaud the government’s recent efforts to reconstitute the AntiNarcotics Task Force to combat opium poppy cultivation in Manipur, we strongly urge them to consider the inclusion of cannabis eradication in this initiative. A comprehensive approach that includes all forms of illicit drug cultivation and trafficking is the need of the hour. Cannabis is still illegal in Manipur and It’s time to address the cannabis issue with the same urgency and determination as opium poppy cultivation to ensure a drug-free future for Manipur. The missing piece in the fight against illicit drugs cannot be ignored any longer.(Thangjanganba Luwang is a concerned citizen, a freelance-writer and truth seeker.

The Open Letter signed by concerned Meitei Diaspora worldwide and their supporters was submitted to the PMO on Monday, 4th September 2023.FULL TEXT BELOW:To,Shri Narendra Modi,Prime Minister of India,152, South Block, Raisina Hill,New Delhi – 1100113 September 2023Subject: Urgent Plea for Immediate Intervention to Restore Normalcy and Harmony in ManipurRespected Prime Minister Sir,On this solemn 3rd September, 2023, Manipur stands at the threshold of the fifth month, engulfed in turmoil. We, the Meitei Diaspora and our supporters, write to you today with a heavy heart and seek your intervention to end the violence and bring normalcy in Manipur, protect our farmers, and foster enduring peace amongst all the communities in Manipur.As India makes significant strides in development and prepares to host the G20 summit, the persistence of violence in Manipur threatens to undermine these achievements. The ongoing violence in Manipur has fractured the social fabric of the state. As custodians of the aspirations for a united and harmonious Manipur and India, we earnestly implore you to take resolute measures to prevent further escalation of the situation. The people of Manipur deserve lives free from fear, where they can thrive in an atmosphere marked by peace, stability and safety.The turmoil has placed our farmers, the backbone of our society, in grave jeopardy. The tragic incidents of farmers being attacked highlights their predicaments. For instance, on 29 August 2023, Salam Jotin, a 37-year-old farmer was shot by a long-range sniper gun while working at his field at Naranseina, Bishnupur District. The situation has been exacerbated by the displacement of many farmers currently forced to live in relief camps. Manipur is on the verge of a conflict-induced famine and starvation as farmers are not able to work in their fields despite the presence of security forces for their protection.More Stories like thisYUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022YOONGOU LITRE 250 ROM PHAGATTUNA MANGHANKHRESep 4, 2022The ongoing violence has jeopardised the future of thousands of students, forcing them to discontinue their education. These harsh circumstances not only interrupt their current schooling but also cast an immense threat over their future opportunities. Education serves as the foundation for personal advancement and development. When violence forcibly removes this opportunity, it deprives the students of their potential and the possibility of realising their aspirations. This repercussion reverberates beyond individual lives, impeding the progress and prosperity of our society. Putting an end to senseless violence becomes paramount in preserving the dreams and ambitions of our youth.Appeal for Immediate Intervention to Restore Normalcy in ManipurSir, we acknowledge the intricate complexities inherent to our Manipur society – the Meiteis, the Nagas, and the Kuki communities, each with their own unique identities and aspirations. However, the pivotal role of your esteemed office is to serve as a binding force that ensures the protection and progress of every Indian citizen. By initiating meaningful dialogues among these communities, you hold the key to nurturing understanding and collaboration, paving the way for peacefulcoexistence.We implore you to engage personally with the Chief Minister of Manipur and the relevant authorities to restore the normalcy in our Manipur. The innocent people of Manipur have borne the burden of suffering beyond imagination and it is our collective responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being.Sir, as the Leader of our Great Nation, you have the power to shape the destiny of our Manipur and to illuminate the path of effective governance, empathy and bring in the much needed unity of the people of Manipur. We humbly request you to visit Manipur and meet the affected people by this senseless violence and ongoing turmoil. Your presence in Manipur and immediate intervention will bring hope and a sense of security to the violence ridden people and assure their life and livelihood.We hope your Leadership will pave the way to a peaceful and prosperous Manipur.Sincerely,Meitei Diaspora and Supporters.Copy to:● Shri Amit Shah, Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs of India● Shri Rajnath Singh, Hon’ble Minister of Defence of India● Shri Dr. S Jaishankar, Hon’ble Minister of External Affairs of India● Shri N.

2024-census-shows-loktak-waterbird-count-lowest-in-decade,"State Coordinator of IBCN Manipur Chapter, RK Birjit informed that the count of 14,235 waterbirds belonging to 11 families this season is disappointing as compared to the count of 21,634 last year and 47,472 in 2022, 37992 in 2021 and 36,434 in 2020.TFM DeskThe annual 2024 waterbird census conducted in the Loktak wetland complex indicated a declining trend as compared to the preceding years, reveals the census report released Saturday jointly by the Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN, Manipur Chapter) and the Loktak Development Authority (LDA).Addressing media persons at the office complex of LDA, State Coordinator of IBCN Manipur Chapter, RK Birjit informed that the count of 14,235 waterbirds belonging to 11 families this season is disappointing as compared to the count of 21,634 last year and 47,472 in 2022, 37992 in 2021 and 36,434 in 2020.A high of 50,725 waterbirds were counted in 2015 and this was considered significant in the backdrop of the Ramsar guideline’s nominal criteria of 20,000 waterbirds count for important wetlands to be included in the list of Ramsar sites of international importance under the Ramsar Convention of 1971, said Birjit.The population chart of waterbirds visiting Loktak wetland complex during the ten-year assessment period from 2015 to 2024 indicates fluctuation in the population trend, however, the 2024 census revealed the lowest-ever count in the decade. The main reason for the downward trend could be attributed to increased human presence and related anthropogenic activities in the lake area that are not favourable to the wintering waterbirds, opined Birjit.More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024The 14,235 total waterbird population count belonged to 45 species including 17 migratory species, 26 resident species, and 2 local migration species.

He said there was a need to create “champions” from the state.Metha stated that Nagaland has the potential and scope and added that an investment of human resources is a must besides having best coaches, trainers, and including physiotherapists, and other support staffs.He also extended his appreciation to all sections of the Naga society especially to the sport fraternity to conclave together and to work as one.In his presidential address, Kesonyu Yhome (IAS), commissioner and secretary to Nagaland chief minister said that the Nagaland Badminton Association (NBA) is commemorating its 50th anniversary. He as the NBA crosses huge milestone, it also stands at a “crucial juncture” to revisit its efforts and dig deep to see if it has done justice to the opportunity given to it in steering the affairs of the sport.Over the years, few individuals have put in selfless efforts to take the NBA and the game of badminton to where it stands today, Yhome lamented that most of the players have been rather casual in their approach as according to him the “business” as usual approach would not quite fetch any individual “points” to take everyone any further for which he suggested for an “open mind” and also to welcome all genuine suggestions and inputs from those who love and understand the game.He went on to add that in order to understand the basic challenges, the NBA has been pursuing two critical components with the Nagaland state government with regard to infrastructure facilities and career opportunities for athletes where its was learnt that some “baby steps” have been taken but according to him there is lot of ground to cover and while assuring that the NBA would continue to take the ventures to their logical conclusion.Reminding that the 45th inter district and state open championship was held in the summer this year in Kohima, Kesonyu said the association consciously decided to segregate the “Masters Open” unlike earlier years in order to give dedicated focus importance to the young talents in the State who could potentially go on in representing the state as well as the country while also adding that NBA’s priority is always to “scout” and groom talents especially those players in the age groups of the under nine, eleven, and thirteen categories and the priorities not to “waver”.On the other hand, the NBA president and bureaucrat, Kesonyu Yhome, disclosed that the Master’s category is now a recognized format at all levels and therefore it is important that the association continue to promote the very particular sport (badminton) at all levels and for all ages while stating that it is the veterans who bear the guiding torch and light the path for all young talents to sail through.Mentioning that it is important that the sport is “marketed” for all ages in order to cultivate a “vibrant culture” of badminton in particular and other sporting disciplines in particular in the present Naga society, Kesonyu further stated that single’s category has been introduced this year so that “stars of yesteryears” could get an opportunity to polish their skills, improvise their fitness and potentiality to go on in participating in major events both at the national and international levels in “earning” a name or two for the state.A journey in Badminton in the state was shared by the first NIS badminton coach, Atu Pongener, while the NBA Golden Jubilee Coffee Table Book was also released as part of the grand finale of the said badminton championship."

2020, the pro vice-chancellor, Nagaland University, Meriema Campus, Kohima, GT Thong, on November 10 stated that higher education in the state is in transition and progressing forward.Speaking at the inaugural session of the two days Triennial Conference cum national seminar organized by All Nagaland Government College Teachers’ Association (ANGCTA) which began a day earlier at Dimapur College Campus, Thong highlighted on the educational transition in Nagaland where the journey began with founding of the Fazl Ali college in Mokokchung, Nagaland, in 1959, with enrollment of 43 students and three teachers.Today, as he reminisces, he said that more than 600 teachers and 17 government colleges are there in the state and the 64 year journey has immensely contributed to the growth of education in Nagaland with Kohima Science College, now an autonomous college, is rated among the best autonomous colleges in the northeast part of India which shows the immense potential the state of Nagaland has quality for quality education.He hoped that the conclave or the triennial conference would ignite the spark that would take higher education in Nagaland even to greater heights despite encountering many “problems” plaguing the state, the government colleges have progressed well and produced towering personalities in diverse fields.Thong said since India attained its Independence, there was strong focus on primary education where higher education was miserably neglected and the “myopic policies” then had caused drastic cuts in public expenditure and keeping in mind with it, many reforms in higher education has marked into a transition starting from welfare-statism to neoliberal market philosophy as he highlighted that this was largely due to indicators pointing to the immense contribution of the higher education to economic development, and reduction of “poverty and inequalities”.He also stated that the Nagaland government has realized that only strengthening higher education can build a “knowledge-based society” so as to achieve a “revolution” in information technology for which he informed that the 11th 5 year Plan (2007-12) has planned for better educational policies leading to development of higher education to a great extend while explaining that the private sectors are now together playing a tremendous role in shaping higher education.However, the pro-vice chancellor said “emphasize” has to be laid on monitoring the “private players” in order to ensure corruption is checked while also adding the “reforms” have now led to improvised governance and accreditation mechanisms.Thong also said that with redesigning of the curriculum framework in NEP 2020, higher education is in “transition” with skill education which is now essential component as the later aims in developing and in producing employable youths to meet the ever increasing demand in the “Indian market”, therefore he was of the opinion that colleges should tie-up with skill training institutes.Furthering his opinion, the vice-chancellor stated that the vast coverage of the NEP-2020 poses numerous challenges including poor infrastructures and funding in its implementation in the state while the government colleges in the state face shortages of “teachers and classrooms” though the government colleges in the state cater to the needy sections of the society by way of affordable education for which it was suggested that the Nagaland government must enhance the budget of the department which would help in recruiting more teachers and enhance classroom spaces in the existing colleges.Thong also said that some issues in the NEP-2020 appears to be impractical as of now but resolvable and there is no need to be panicked or to be reluctant as according to him, the very concept of education itself is changing dramatically thus, the value based education with added expertise is at the very “core” of the NEP 2020.He said that Data of all India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) showed a National Gross Enrollment Ration (GER) of 27.3 percent in 2020-21, which the NEP 2020 aimed to increase to 50 percent by the year 2035, however, Thong lamented the status of the state by stating that in Nagaland, it is measly 18.7 percent and now it is time to raise the figure.GT Thong also said that about 10,000 students are admitted to the government colleges in Nagaland every year which accounts for only 1/3 of the total students enrollment in the state and to reach the target of the 50 percent GER, he encouraged to double it in the next five years while citing that the teachers should not be the cause of “downgrading” of the average national average while insisting on to impart quality education with a call that the government of Nagaland has to attract and retain highly qualified teachers to enhance the overall growth and standard of higher education in Nagaland.According to Thong, it was learned that there are only 151 teachers with PhD degrees in the 17 government colleges in the state which he said that it is only 25 percent of about 600 teachers, for which he suggested the Nagaland government to encourage and ensure that all non-PhD faculties earn their doctorate degrees at the earliest.He later said that the ANGCTA conference is aimed at scholarly discourse on “Higher Education in Transition” and on emphasizing on the success of the multifaceted NEP-2020 by addressing the inherent weakness in Nagaland’s higher education system.Meanwhile, the ANGCTA has forwarded a representation to the vice-chancellor, Nagaland University, Lumami, on matters pertaining to implementation of “curriculum framework” under FYUGP, and another representation letter was handed over to the concern in order to reach the Minister, Higher Education, Nagaland, with content of various grievances the teachers face including age of superannuation, professorship, PhD increment, guest faculty provision, and others which was issued by the association’s president, A Moamongla Aier, and general secretary, Dr Yelhi Vero."

when-climate-debates-knock-on-the-door,"Himalayan landscape is witnessing no snow this winter. No snow meant no tourists, and no tourists meant dream shattered for many expecting tourist footfalls for their tourism businesses — hotel bookings, hot chais, hot chapatis — all gone with the wind.By Salam RajeshTourists planning for their winter holidays in the mountain landscape of Himachal Pradesh were rudely shaken by a mysterious hand of God — no snow! The snow-laden white mountainscapes of the Himalayan State, like Lahual-Spiti, have always drawn hundreds of skiers and snow-revellers every year, but December-end 2023 and beginning of January 2024 disappointed many. There were only brown capes and no white capes!Newspapers covering this phenomenal process in the Himalayan landscape juggled between two important aspects — the real-time impact of climate change and the hard-hit impact on businesses. No snow meant no tourists, and no tourists meant dream shattered for many expecting tourist footfalls for their tourism businesses — hotel bookings, hotchais,hotchapatis— all gone with the wind.The Himachal experience is interesting from many aspects, of which the significant ones are the rapid process in which climate change discussions are arriving at our doorsteps and the manner in which apparent climate change process is directly impacting people’s lives beyond what the average population expected or read about in newspapers. For many, the climate discourse would be those happening in far-away Arctic Circle and never for once imagining it is knocking at the door.The year 2023 was recorded as the hottest year in a century, with August-September months recording maximum temperatures in these past many decades, and it is expected that the year 2024 will further breach the record. El Nino entered the region’s scene midway last year and for the layman it would be hard to relate how this weather process may have likely impacted the Himachal experience.On another aspect, winter pollution level in neighbouring regions could also be lending a hand in affecting changes in the regional micro climatic regime. For instance, according to climate watch group Climate Trends, last year the national capital region of Delhi experienced a surge in winter pollution being attributed to factors like meteorological conditions and increased emissions. In neighboring Chandigarh, the pollution levels for January, February, and August to November in 2023 showed increase in winter pollution level. And, least to say, Lucknow’s pollution levels in August and September last year fell below the Indian standard of 40 mg/m3.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Pollution and greenhouse gas emission on a larger scale are part of the game changers in affecting reasonable changes in local climatic regimes, added with the spice of global level climate change processes. The world at large is currently busy with so many discussions on how the world is headed to a collision with a possible 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperature by the year 2050, meaning the intensity of summer temperature is likely to surpass the 50 degree Celsius mark. At this measure, many countries will be boiling and mountainscapes are going to be brown instead of white in winter.And so, the climate debates at Aichi, Kyoto, Paris, Montreal, Berlin, Geneva, and many other cities around the world has apparently arrived at our doorsteps in earnest, which interestingly is reflected in the current scenario where the Himalayan state of Himachal is losing its snow in winter, as unimaginable as it can be!At Dubai’s COP28 meet on climate finance last year, the heads of the Adaptation Fund, the Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund together made a joint declaration announcing their climate ambitions.The declaration stated that ‘the need for collective, urgent, and ambitious action on climate is greater than ever before. As the results of the first global stocktake make clear, the world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. While progress is seen in some areas, much more is needed to reach net zero and adapt to climate impacts. A rigorous “all of economy, all of society” approach is needed across all systems and sectors’.On this end, the four entities pledged to work collectively to ‘enhance access to climate finance by working together across the areas of our activities’. In brief, they pledge to:We will seek to increase collaboration within our capacity – building support, recognizing that developing countries need the capacity to turn climate plans into projects, and to move from ambition to action.We will aim to develop greater synergies within our programming and between our theories of change, and to scale up projects. The MCFs (multilateral climate funds) have a number of collaborative programming initiatives which are already realizing strong results. We will develop this work and further explore the potential for joint programming initiatives that could allow us to deploy our collective resources at a larger scale and with greater efficiency.We will ramp up our collaborative work on monitoring, evaluation, and learning, including through the development of common indicators, alignment of our results frameworks, and the development of a common database for climate projects taking into account innovative tools.We will move towards harmonization of our procedures and processes, recognizing that complex application procedures, which are different for each fund, can be a significant barrier to accessing to climate finance.This is the level of urgency in global climate finance debates seeking collateral activities aimed at speeding up the execution of multilateral work programs to meet climate goals within the stipulated time frame, which is roughly between the years 2030 and 2050 as discussed in several forums under the United Nations system.In an emotional outburst, the UN secretary general Antonio Gueterres recently had called out to world leaders that the world is headed for climate catastrophe if countries are not willing to pool in their resources to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets well in time. In fact, several countries are currently experiencing the climate heat with phenomenal wildfires, floods, droughts, sea level rise, cyclonic storms, cloudbursts, glacial retreats, and many other processes, of which perhaps Himachal going snowless this winter could be hard evidence."

The Committee shall convene its meeting as and when required.

It would be wrong to say every divergent view is a misinterpretation or distortion of facts. We must accept the fact that one man’s freedom fighter is another man’s terrorist and human understanding and interpretation is never black and white.Instead of dictating what to publish or what not to publish, the state government could take whatever possible steps for encouraging academic research on areas that will serve state interests. It could earmark budgetary allocation for state universities and higher education department for publications of books on identified subjects and create scholarships for researchers. It may call for research papers from scholars for publication. The newly-constituted committee could at the best accord the approval for the state government’s publication of books.If the state government goes all out for pre-publication censorship despite the criticism from the academic world, it would set a wrong precedent and have serious ramifications, hampering all the research works concerning the state and fuelling discontent among young scholars.The state government must handle the situation with responsibility, humility and openness. It must try to create a healthy atmosphere for discussions and debates on the contentious issues among the informed stakeholders."
its-time-to-act-for-nature-unep,"For India, as is true of other nations, in the recent past there was a huge task of drawing up the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans, including Manipur, whereas it has been hinted by environmental workers that the country’s NBSAP process is nowhere to be seen working on ground.By Salam RajeshNature-based solutions projected at ecosystem protection, restoration and improved management of farmlands are amongst the most effective strategies for reducing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in addressing climate issues, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on limiting global warming well below 1.5 degree Celsius by the year 2030 to 2050.The issue on unregulated emissions from unwanted forest fires, stubble burnings, peatland burning for reclamation to facilitate commercial farming, fossil fuel emissions from industries, motor vehicles, aviation, and many more are said to have influenced drastic changes in the atmosphere for which global warming has become a huge problem for the blue planet and all life forms that exist on Earth.Supplementing on this subjective matter of global concern, Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has this to say, “The big question that humanity faces at this pivotal moment is how to transform our economic systems, including processes of production and consumption, to ensure that we remain within planetary boundaries, limit climate change, and reverse the loss of nature and endangered species”.The UNEP’s executive director’s note of urgency is reflected in the organization’s latest report ‘State of Finance for Nature – Time to Act: Doubling investment by 2025 and eliminating nature-negative finance flows’ (2022) (https://wedocs.unep.org/20.500.11822/41333).The State of Finance for Nature report ‘quantifies public and private finance flows to Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in tackling global challenges related to biodiversity loss, land degradation and climate change’.The report states that ‘current investments are compared to investment needed to meet targets of the Rio Conventions under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)’.It is generally accepted across forums that the Nature-based Solutions can play a major role in addressing a broad range of societal challenges, from managing water scarcity and food insecurity to reducing disaster risk to poverty alleviation, closely reflecting the targets set in the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals of the UN.The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that nature-positive policies could ‘attract more than US$10 trillion in new annual business value and create 395 million jobs by the year 2030’. The report focuses specifically on the ability of NbS to tackle societal challenges related to the climate crisis, land degradation and biodiversity loss.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Looking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024In the broad discussions on finding solutions to the myriad issues directly or indirectly related to climate change, it is generalized that both the terrestrial and marine ecosystems are primarily responsible for absorbing and storing about half of global carbon emissions.On the basis of this stated argument, there has been a focused move by international organizations to work jealously towards restoring landscapes, both terrestrial and marine, in meeting the goals set under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).The State of Finance for Nature report equally lays stress on human rights and gender equality as integral to financing NbS, ‘particularly the use of public funds to ensure equitable and effective solutions on the ground’. This basically looks at financing strategies that can resolve issues on ground and in real time, such as achieving restoration of large tracts of degraded forest lands and partially ‘dying’ wetlands through the active participation of Indigenous peoples and local communities who largely depend on these landscapes for their living.A key message in the report specifically states that the “Finance flows to NbS are currently US$154 billion per year, less than half of the US$384 billion per year investment in NbS needed by 2025 and only a third of investment needed by 2030 (US$484 billion per year)”. At this calculation, it is certainly alarming that the push for achieving the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is not meeting the desired targets within the stipulated time.Another important aspect profiled in the report says that, “With sufficient finance, NbS provide the means to cost-effectively reach climate, biodiversity and land degradation neutrality targets, particularly if investments simultaneously contribute to biodiversity (National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans [NBSAPs]), climate (Nationally determined contributions [NDC]) and restoration (Land Degradation Neutrality [LDN]) targets. This ‘double’ or ‘triple’ win potential is particularly alluring given the current economic situation”.For India, as is true of other nations, in the recent past there was a huge task of drawing up the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans, including Manipur, whereas it has been hinted by environmental workers that the country’s NBSAP process is nowhere to be seen working on ground. Experts involved in the exercise opined that the enduring task has been futile.The UNEP report exhibits a high hope for the future as and when countries commit fully to the objectives in mind, expressing that, “If we rapidly double finance flows to NbS, we can halt biodiversity loss (measured through the Biodiversity Intactness Index), significantly contribute to reducing emissions (5 GtCO2/year by 2025 further rising to 15 GtCO2/year by 2050 in the 1.5°C scenario) and restore close to 1 billion ha of degraded land”.High hopes indeed, as and when compared to the negative human influences in the mountainous tracts of Manipur with the uncontrolled expansion of illegal poppy cultivation, a menace that the Government of Manipur is currently striving to check by all means.The suggested line of action, in tune with the strategies being outlined by the United Nations on ecosystem restoration, is to re-vitalize the NBSAP strategies for the State that looks closely at the many issues and the solutions to these issues, including land degradation, deforestation, water scarcity, food insecurity, biodiversity loss, and the possible impacts of climate change through a time phase.A robust planning is needed to be put in action, more particularly considering the rough mountainous terrain that covers almost 90 percent of the State, and more significantly, the engagement of local communities in a wholesome task towards achieving the goals of the NBSAP at the local context.(The writerlooks at environmental stories through the journalistic lens.He can be reached at[email protected])"

It encapsulates the story of the renowned and mighty ruler, King Dusharatha of Ayodhya and how his fondness for hunting animals through archery led him to commit a heinous crime.TFM ReportA mime play aptly titled ‘Cheitheng’ of Kanglei Mime Theatre Repertory (KMTR) was showcased at the repertory’s theatre hall at Langthabal Kunja, Imphal West on Sunday, September 18. The showcase was jointly organised by KMTR in collaboration with the State’s Art and Culture Department, sponsored by The Ministry of Culture, Government of India. The programme was attended by Commissioner of Art and Culture, M. Joy Singh and Impact TV Chief Editor, Yumnam Rupachandra as Chief Guest and President respectively.Speaking on the occasion, M. Joy stated that theatrical play is a powerful medium that reflects the feeble nature of the human life cycle. The movements and characters portrayed on stage reminds the audience of the mundane existence each individual lives through everyday, he added.The Commissioner stated, an individual showing deviant behaviour in society is shunned in Manipur. As such he highlighted the vitality of the theatrical universe as remedial tools to correct and address such deviant nature in the society. M. Joy further lauded KMTR for its relentless effort to preserve and uphold the status of mime theatre in the State.Meanwhile, giving his presidential speech, Yumnam Rupachandra said, art and artist are reeling under immense pressure to sustain their existence in the State. He remarked that revenue generation remains a looming threat to the existence of various art forms such as films, theatre plays, Shumang Lila.More Stories like thisNagaland: Festival of Orality begins at Tetso College…Nov 3, 2023‘Samkhok’, film on unique indigenous way of…Sep 9, 2023Manipur: 50 glorious years of NS Films to be observedJan 23, 2023He added that a defined market with proper marketing and revenue system in the State is the immediate need to ensure the self sustenance of such significant mediums. Rupachandra further sought for the people’s support in developing and curating the various arts.Directed by Yumnam Sadananda ‘Cheitheng’ which literally translates to ‘agony’, is a mime play extracted from an episode of the Hindu epic the ‘Ramayana’. It encapsulates the story of the renowned and mighty ruler, King Dusharatha of Ayodhya and how his fondness for hunting animals through archery led him to commit a heinous crime.Even with the mastery of the art of ‘Shavdhavedhan’, he committed the blunder of killing Sharwankumar; the loyal son whose only moral obligation was to serve his blind parents, Shantavan and Gyanvati.The mime play follows the repercussions Dusharatha had to pay for his momentary blunder and how it haunted him during his unfortunate demise.It may be mentioned that the play has been approved for showcase at the 37th International Mime Theatre Festival which is going to be held in Germany from 2-6 November. However, KMTR’s interview for the Schengen visa (Europe’s most common visa) application falls on December. As such the repertory urged the External Affairs Minister of State, R.K Ranjan to prepone the interview date in the interest of the State’s art and culture.Meanwhile, sharing his views after witnessing the play, Renowned ‘Nokphade’ Producer, Ruhinikumar Thoudam said, a proper narration will be needed to make international audiences familiar with the whole plotline of the play. He exuded confidence that the play’s remarkable talents will be able to break through the cultural and the narrative barrier.He stressed on the need to create a defined market in the State for such peculiar artforms. There is also need to develop sophisticated consciousness among audience by exposing them to such branches of the arts, he added. Ruhinikumar further urged authorities concerned to promote such peculiar arts and support KMTR, which is currently the only professional Mime repertory in the State."

moscows-inevitable-war,"Throughout the 1990s, most western powers were celebrating their triumphant against ‘evil socialism’, narrative such as the ‘end of history’ were accelerated, and taking absolute advantage against Russia’s acute vulnerability of the then. The huge state infrastructures that the Soviet once built up were either privatized or in the utter state of chaos in the 90s, together with social declined. But this situation has changed with Putin coming into the political scene of the 21 century.By Chongtham GunnamaniAt least 25 civilians have been reported killed in a wave of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, as Kyiv said it was nearly ready to launch a huge assault to retake occupied land.The attacks on the cities of Dnipro and Uman in the early hours of Friday (April 28) were the first large-scale air raids in nearly two months. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble, searching for survivors and bodies as anxious people stood by. Officials said at least 23 civilians were killed there, including four children. This is the latest development so far as reported by world media.What we get to hear and read on the war is nothing but destruction and devastation, leaving thousands of people helpless. When we see death and destruction, any concerned citizens of the world will ask this question, who wants war? Who wants to go for a war especially in 21stcentury? The answer is no one.As we all have agreed that any war has catastrophic consequences, be it in Iraq, Vietnam or elsewhere. Any rational mind would certainly be against wars in principle. But, this ongoing Russia’s war against Ukraine since 24 February 2022, which Russia called it as ‘Special Operation is justifiable from the perspective of a nation-state, sans so called western interpreted international peace, justice and so on.For long, Russia has been provoked and betrayed by the geo-ideological construct called ‘western’ powers, primarily dominated by Franco-British, US and the followers in their shared logic of exploitative capital, asserting always terms such as democracy and human rights in disguise. People around the world are quite fade-up of the western rhetoric of democracy as it has witnessed in toppling of elected governments; Mosaddegh’s Iran, Allende’s Chile or Sukarno’s Indonesia, to mention a few, and backed many worst dictators.More Stories like this2023 was a deadliest year for journalists in a decade: PECJan 4, 2024PEC expresses concern over arrest of Burmese journalistsDec 15, 2023Record number of journalists killed in Gaza within 2 monthsDec 9, 2023The US, being the only nation so far that dropped atomic bombs against the civilians of Japan, is so apprehensive of any powers, most prominently skeptical about Russia and China, and also wanted to keep all nations under its knee in align with former colonial powers which have shared common interest in dominating the world. Time and again, the US has been well known as a trouble maker throughout the corners of the world; Latin America, Asia, Africa, anywhere, its sole objective is to control. So far, Russia stood against this western hegemonism, a position which exemplify moral power of freedom in many third world countries.At the absence of former Soviet bloc, the world has been witnessing continuous NATO’s eastward expansion, which is a total betrayal of what was agreed upon during the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Contrary to the facts, most western media are reporting fake news on Russia issues as a mere tool of western powers and corporate; their sole interest is nothing to do with democracy or human rights as they preached, but to exploit the Russian market and its vast natural resources.Anti-Russian propaganda has been quite normalized for decades and it is internalized in the psyche of the western world. It is something like of what Noam Chomsky termed as ‘manufacturing consent’. Since the beginning of this war, Russian side of narratives have been systematically censored from the social media, and anti-Russian propaganda have increased on gigantic scale.It’s not new that the western powers have instigated crisis after crisis in Ukraine against Russia. Those western staged ‘Colour Revolutions’ in the former soviet republics, including Ukraine destabilized the whole social fabrics in the region. The western powers have been orchestrating anti-government protests when any democratically elected Russian incline governments come to power in Kiev. The Euro-American powers have a firm objective to control over Ukraine and always install a their friendly government in Kiev, in order to exert their hegemony over Russia. So, Ukraine has become a springboard for western hegemony, no doubt about this.It’s also a common practice that the western powers have been accelerating ethnic divides in the former Soviet republics, whether in Ukraine or in the Baltic states, where Russian speakers are categorised as ‘other’, and treated them as ‘outsider’ at their own states. As a consequence of such policies of systematic exclusion, we have witnessed the extreme forms of rebellion in Donbas, Crimea, etc. If the Euro-American powers hadn’t meddled Ukraine, and let Viktor Yanukovych continue as the president in 2014, much bloodshed could have been avoided. It’s not new that the Euro-American powers meddled and hijacked elected authorities if the people voted against their wishes, but the consequences are end up in disaster. The case of Ukraine has no exception.Throughout the 1990s, most western powers were celebrating their triumphant against ‘evil socialism’, narrative such as the ‘end of history’ were accelerated, and taking absolute advantage against Russia’s acute vulnerability of the then. The huge state infrastructures that the Soviet once built up were either privatized or in the utter state of chaos in the 90s, together with social declined. But this situation has changed with Putin coming into the political scene of the 21 century.With the dawn of 21 century, Putin stabilized Russian socio-economic order, and Russia emerged at the world stage as a source of physical and moral power to many nations which have suffered the pains of western imperialism. Putin effectively mitigated western hegemonism in spheres of world politics. Thus, he builds up a confident and self-reliant Russia, that’s why the west hated Putin. But, he is performing of what an independent nation-state is supposed to perform. So far his position on the Ukrainian stalemate is cleared and that is the NATO expansion at Russia’s border.So if NATO defended its invasion in Yugoslavia as ‘military humanism’, NATO has no reason to condemn Russia for the war against Ukraine, though it’s not a secret that, this war is fought between Russia and NATO, not Ukraine. And, the fundamental difference is between the issue of Yugoslavia and Ukraine is that Yugoslavia was never posed a threat to NATO, but the inclusion of Ukraine into NATO is an existential threat for Russia. So, this war is inevitable for Russia.(Chongtham Gunnamani is Assistant Professor (Centre for South East Asian Studies), Nagaland University.

high-cost-living-impacts-population-dynamics,"The comparative scale of the rising cost of living in Manipur as of today may dissuade urban young women from marrying at all, or to tie the wedding knot very late in their 30s, as is similarly taking shape in costly nations like Japan – and definitely many countries in EuropeBy Salam RajeshA recent newspaper clip on Japan’s ever rising cost of living captured a related concern on its population dynamics, one that expects a catastrophic turn in its population statistics – reducing it to none after the horrifying aftermath of the atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the fag end of the Second World War.Reporting on the latest concerns in the country of the ‘rising Sun’, agencies reflected on the probability of women in Japan either opting out of marriage or marrying very late in age with the purpose of having a single child, or none at all. The impact is from the burden of rising children with living costs reaching the ceiling, becoming unaffordable for many in the highly urbanized locations.A report of Japan’s National Institute of Population and Social Security Research estimated that 33.4 percent of women born in 2005 indicated their inclination in not having children at all, a statistics that is starting to worry the Nipponese Government. The agencies reported that despite the Government’s lucrative offer to families having three or more children with big payoffs, many young women are not going in for the bait.A 2020 survey finding indicated that Japanese women were marrying 3.9 years later than usual, often marrying in their late 30s. This is enough reason for childless issues, senior analyst Takuya Hoshino observed. The resulting impact analysis is that Japan’s overall population of 126.15 million is expected to fall down to 87 million by 2070 if things are not reversed.At an average reading, the cost of living in Japan is roughly 132.4 percent higher than in India, where the average rent in Japan is around 221.2 percent higher than in India. A quick look at the Japanese market says banana costs as much as INR 189 a bunch, tomato costs INR 347 a kilo, onion costs INR 189.71 a kilo, and a one-litre water bottle costs INR 70.79 for instance.More Stories like thisManipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Pambei-led UNLF greets RPF on latter’s Raising DayFeb 25, 2024Bidyananda sent to police custody for five more daysFeb 10, 2024A comparative study of the Imphal markets would reveal a similar trend of rising costs of the commodities, for instance like a plate of eggs that cost around INR 90 just few years back now cost INR 300, while a bunch of banana that used to cost INR 15 now has crossed INR 50 and more – sometimes going up to INR 250 for a good bunch.Tomato is truly costly in Japan at INR 347 a kilo and so most people may refrain from eating tomatoes! The corresponding rising cost of essentials in Manipur also demonstrates a rising cost in living where cost of education for the children is sky-rocketing as in the private schools.Japan’s national IPSSR institute estimated that the tuition fees at private universities had increased five-fold since 1975 and nineteen times more since 2021, indicating that studying in the Nipponese cities is truly expensive today. It can be said to be true of the private institutions in Imphal where the cost of tuition and transport fees for the school going kids are exceptionally high, going at more than INR 2000 in a month for the private school vans.A visible impact of the rise in salaries for the government employees through the 6th and 7th Pay Commissions had corresponding effect on the market with vendors raising the scale of prices of the commodities in market. One single piece of egg now cost INR 8 or more, while youngsters of today will not believe that four eggs cost just INR 1 only in the 1970s and early 1980s! For that matter, the roadside vegetable vendors will not negotiate anything less than INR 10 where enough coriander leaves or green chives could be had for INR 2 only less than a decade back.Land valuation in the Imphal urban and peri-urban areas have sky-jumped manifold, increased by as many as ten times or more. In the peri-urbans, a plot of agricultural land was sold at INR 18,000 for one point while it has crossed the limits at INR 4 lakhs per point, and where an acre of land now cost INR 30 lakhs and more – as compared to just INR 5 lakhs for the same size of plot as in 2008.This issue brings back to that discussion on Japanese young women now preferring to remain single up to their late 30s, or not marrying at all, considering the rising cost of living and the probability of facing difficulties in raising their children in consideration to the sky-rocketing prices of food, medicine and education. It may have an equal impact on the lives of the urban population back home as prices soar with each passing year.The price for a 15.6 kilo cylinder of the cooking gas was around INR 445 few years back but a consumer has to dish out INR 1200 or more at the current market price without subsidy. This writer visited a few Manipuri Muslim inhabited villages in Thoubal District for a survey some years back and found that the marginalized families had gone back to their Chula using firewood as they could not afford the ‘expensive’ cooking gas. This may be said to be equally true for those families living in the remote areas in Manipur’s hill districts.The subject matter then brings up the concerns on the haves and the have-nots divide – the rich and the poor divide basically – as compared with the salaried community and those in the non-formal sectors. The rising divide is also a factor for increasing the level of tension in society whenever there is a crisis in the State, as when the highways are blocked due to ethnic rioting and the essential commodities become limited, or due to economic recesses, and / or due to inflation.The comparative scale of the rising cost of living in Manipur as of today may dissuade urban young women from marrying at all, or to tie the wedding knot very late in their 30s, as is similarly taking shape in costly nations like Japan – and definitely many countries in Europe – thus reshaping the fabric of the demographic profile of States and infusing a new living style where remaining single, or the preference for a single child, becomes the norm."

Urging parents to encourage their children to actively engage in sporting activities, Chongloi highlighted that parents can actually pave the way to a better future for their children, physically, emotionally, academically, and much more.Apart from stressing the need to emphasize sports education, the Jangnoi Youth Club has been actively engaged in a project called ‘Clean Jangnoi’ since the past many years and also set up bamboo farming to encourage the youths for which they require assistance and support from the concerned department."

These resolutions had already been forwarded to the central government, he added.In his capacity as the leader of the House, chief minister Biren endorsed the proposal to pass the resolution, emphasising the Assembly’s pivotal role as the custodian of Manipur’s destiny."

This report suggests that Indian journalists – like journalists all around the world – can help their audiences get a better understanding of the links between climate change and these devastating heatwaves,” said Dr James Painter from the University of OxfordTFM DeskWith the onset of warmer weather leading to the Indian summer months, Climate Trends released a new study led by Dr James Painter from the University of Oxford, analysing the Indian media coverage of the 2022 heatwaves in multiple languages across the country.A press statement issued by climate Trends said the study illustrates that 14% of English news articles and 24% of English news videos made the connection to climate change in their reportage on the heatwaves. Meanwhile the regional language media demonstrated a lower percentage share of climate attribution to heatwaves. Hindi has a 7% share, Marathi 6% and Telugu 3%.Most of the Indian media relied on scientists, meteorologists and scientific bodies to build the case for climate change which allowed lesser chance of scientifically inaccurate binary causation statements like climate change is ‘solely’ responsible for the heat event. In contrast, a large portion of the Hindi language media relied on binary causation statements.Dr James Painter, Research Associate at Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford and lead author of the study said, “Climate science tells us heatwaves in India are only going to become more intense. This report suggests that Indian journalists – like journalists all around the world – can help their audiences get a better understanding of the links between climate change and these devastating heatwaves.”Dr Jagadish Thaker, Senior Lecturer, University of Queensland and co-author of the study added, “Currently, Indian media is falling short of its potential to educate Indians about climate change. Through accurate and consistent coverage of climate change-related extreme weather events such as heatwaves, Indian media can help a large segment of Indians learn and understand how to respond to climate change.”More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024The study said the heatwave affecting India in 2022 was unprecedented for its record temperatures, its early onset, unusually long duration and the large area that was affected. According to the World Weather Attribution, the heatwave was made 30 times more likely due to climate change. It was widely reported in the news media for its intensity and impact.The study evaluated media coverage of the heatwave from March to May 2022. Using manual content analysis, it found that 272 English articles out of a total of 1,930 English-language articles in the three months under review mentioned some type of link to climate change or global warming, equivalent to 14%.It said more than 70% of the articles either presented climate change as making the 2022 heatwave more intense or more frequent or used a variant of a generic trend statement such as ‘this heatwave is the sort of event which (scientists say) could become more frequent and/or intense in the future’.The Climate Trends’ statement said the multiple challenges of addressing heatwaves in India were discussed at a webinar, from communicating it to attribution and preparedness. As climate change leads to rise in temperatures, local weather systems across the country are witnessing unprecedented shifts.It further said January 2024 saw the second lowest precipitation in the Western Himalayas (5cm) in the last 100 years according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Expecting an early onset of summer months, Dr Naresh Kumar, Senior Scientist at the IMD said, “the heat hazard warning conditions are being introduced from this year by IMD. The summer forecast is likely to be issued on 1st March instead of 1st April, like it used to be earlier. Heat wave days are increasing across all parts of India. For March, the temperature is higher in South Peninsular India. We are issuing high temperatures and humidity warnings for Kerala and Rayalaseema. The maximum temperature could go up to 38 degrees and humidity on the higher side.”Analysing the last 100 years of data, Climate Central’s VP for Science, Dr Andrew Pershing explained that El Niño conditions are warmer now than they were earlier. “Our study shows that autumn has become the fastest warming season. As for winter, the warming trends in February vs January are very different in the western parts of India. There is a trend of a faster shift to hotter weather conditions, shrinking the spring season.”With the start of the summer season, there are questions on the preparedness of authorities to deal with the scale of the problem. Dr Abhiyant Tiwari, Lead – Climate Resilience and Health programme, Natural Resource Defense Council (India) claimed that, “the vulnerability index is being developed now. A multi departmental dialogue was initiated to develop decentralisation of the action plan, finding budgets and institutionalising heat action plans. However, with higher night time temperatures and higher daytime temperatures, with no cooling and poor ventilation facilities for the majority of the population, the situation is challenging.”Climate Trends is a research-based consulting and capacity-building initiative that aims to bring greater focus on issues of environment, climate change and sustainable development."

Being born in an influential family, his siblings were exposed to the outside world from the early days. Since his childhood, he was interested in painting and other technical works. Due to many hardships his family had to face in the remote village, they shifted their home to Phoijing Chingmang Awang, Nambol in Bishnupur District and settled down there.Laishram Phonindro SinghDuring his early years in Nambol High school, he was known by his teachers for his talent in arts and was assigned for the painting of the school activities, celebrations, etc. Under the guidance of one of his teachers late RK Modhusana, he decided to step forward in this field of art.

Furthermore, imposing the death penalty is contrary to international human rights principles”, asserted the NUG opposed to the military regime.TFM DeskThe national group staunchly opposed to the junta in Myanmar called the ‘National Unity Government’ (NUG) has severely criticised the current military regime for the imposition of “Death Penalty” against people, including the recent sentencing of seven students from Dagon University to death.In a press note issued recently, the NUG recalled that on April 21, 2022, the military regime arrested seven young students from Dagon University: Maung Hein Thant, Maung Thiha Htet Zaw, Maung Thura Maung Maung, Maung Khant Linn Maung Maung, Maung KhantZin Win, Maung Thet Paing Oo, and Maung Zaw Linn Naing. They were sentenced to death by an illegitimate prison court on November 30″, 2022, said NUG.Another four youth, Maung Min Htet Tha, Maung Wai Yan Zin, Maung Thu Htoo Aung, and Ko Phyo, had also been sentenced to death by the same prison court, informed NUG.More Stories like this2023 was a deadliest year for journalists in a decade: PECJan 4, 2024PEC expresses concern over arrest of Burmese journalistsDec 15, 2023Record number of journalists killed in Gaza within 2 monthsDec 9, 2023Terming the current regime as “terrorist military”, NUG said it violated people’s democratic rights by arbitrarily detaining those who oppose them through political means, committing extrajudicial killings, violating the political rights of people, passing judgment through biased courts, and infringing on the legal rights of people. At worst, they violate the people’s right to life by carrying out the inhumane death penalty“The terrorist military does not have the right to control the judiciary as it is not a legitimate government. Furthermore, imposing the death penalty is contrary to international human rights principles”, asserted the NUG.The NUG said that while the United Nations, ASEAN, and the international community have urged for the release of political prisoners, the terrorist military have challenged the entire world by sentencing death penalties on these young students. The terrorist military must be held accountable for committing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.NUG vowed that actions will also be carried out to bring justice for the terrorist military’s unlawful execution of Ko Jimmy, Ko Phyo Zay Yar Thaw, Ko Hla Myo Aung, and Ko Aung Thura, which took place on July 25, 2022, as well as for the people who have suffered from the inhumane and brutal acts committed by the terrorist military group.“We are gathering documentary proof on the nationwide killing and torture of people, workers, farmers, students, and teachers who have been involved in the Spring Revolution. We vow to seek justice and continue to fight against the military dictatorship until federal democracy is restored” said the joint statement issued by NUG’s Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women, Youths and Children Affairs and Ministry of Human Rights."
when-petrol-from-filling-station-turns-out-to-be-cocktail-of-fuel-water,"A proper grievances redressal mechanism should be formulated so as to prevent such situations in the future. Afterall, the price of petrol is not a joke to the pockets of common citizens.By K DevajitOn the way to the office, I thought of refueling my Car, Hyundai i20, as it was running on reserve fuel for the past few days; all the more so because I fear a rise in fuel prices here too, encouraged and panicked by the ongoing crisis in Europe. I went straight from my residence at Singjamei to Moirangkhom Krishna Premi oil pump at around 9:44 am and asked the pump staff to get the fuel tank full with extra premium.Shortly after paying exactly Rs 4,200, I started the engine and drove all the way towards Thangal Bazar. On reaching MG Avenue opposite Nirmala Bas School, my car suddenly gave a jerk and the engine stopped abruptly without any warnings. I feared if anything had gone wrong with the car’s engine. I got the car parked with help from some passers-by and tried to restart the engine several times but to no avail.So, I went to Punya Hyundai and asked for their RoadSide Assistance. Luckily, they assigned me an expert who asked me what had actually happened to the car. I narrated everything, including yesterday’s travels. He confidently told me that it’s a pure case of fuel-related breakdown. To get it physically confirmed, he checked the fuel pipelines. When we checked the fuel, a liquid more similar to water ran out of the pipeline. He immediately confirmed the presence of a large quantity of water in my fuel tank.He clearly told me it might have caused some damage to the engine, especially to the spark plugs. He suggested draining all the contents out of the fuel tank and refuelling so that we can try our luck with the ignition system. To which I said, “let me go and speak with any of the responsible Petrol pump persons who can take full ownership of all the hassles and damages if any. So, I went to the station with a bottle full of the contents from the fuel tank and told their staff I wanted to speak with someone who has authority on the matter. At first, they tried to ignore and pretend as if it wasn’t their fault. After some arguments, the staff called their manager.The manager of the station turned up. I narrated the whole story to him and showed the payment receipt too. But still he was not convinced and ready to accept the situation and tried to avoid and ignore my request. After a few heated discussions, he agreed to come and do the examination.The mechanic removed the content in front of them. To everyone’s surprise, more watery substance came out of the tank than petrol.More Stories like thisMSACS ki warol laibak thibaniMar 8, 2023YUMNAM PATLOU DA MANIPUR LEINGAK KI WAREP HANDOK U HAIDUNA…Dec 13, 2022YUMPHAM YAODABA PROPAGANDA TOUDUNA NAMPHUDA YOO LEGALISATION…Sep 15, 2022I demanded my money be refunded immediately along with any expenses to be incurred of all the damage caused to the car’s system if any. On a more serious note, I even raised the demand of replacing a whole new car, if need be, in the worst case scenario.Initially, the manager turned down my demands and claims. He called up the proprietor’s son. In few minutes, he also turned up and started to show his rich man’s son attitude, trying to teach the technicalities of pump management instead of managing the crisis, to which I mostly tried to make him understand my situation.Here also, I had to argue and counter argue to get the things done in broad daylight of Thangal Bazar.  They agreed to my demands and claims only when a serious and nasty scene developed and other passers-by and shop owners intervenedFinally, they left the scene after agreeing to what I demanded and asked one of their old chaps to stay with us and take part in the entire roadside repair.After all is said and done, the mechanic demanded merely Rs 1,500 as repair charges and they also refunded the whole amount. They also took away the adulterated petrol canister, saying they will further complain to IOC.My major concern here is not the monetary part but the way these so-called Pump owners and the staff behave. They showed total lack of ownership and responsibility. They were so arrogant and high handed and had no regard for common people.I, as a responsible citizen, feel that such issues need to be addressed at a proper platform so that the larger population becomes aware and certain corrective actions can be taken. A proper grievances redressal mechanism can be formulated so as to prevent such situations in the future. Afterall, the price of petrol is not a joke to the pockets of common citizens."
urgent-need-for-intervention-by-indian-central-armed-forces-in-manipurs-drugs-related-ethnic-crisis,"If the Indian Army undertakes the task of eliminating the illegal poppy and cannabis plantations, it is crucial that this intervention is thorough and comprehensive. Breaking the backbone of ongoing violence requires the complete removal ofevery trace of these illegal poppy plantations. To ensure transparency and accountability, impartial third-party observers should be appointed to oversee the operation.By Dr Marc NongmaithemThe state of Manipur finds itself ensnared in a multifaceted crisis involving illicit drug cultivation, trafficking, ethnic violence, and state incapacity. Despite the well-intentioned “War on Drugs” initiative launched by the state government in 2022, the thriving trade of poppy and cannabis cultivation continues to plague Manipur. Furthermore, the recent escalation of ethnic violence intricately linked to the drug trade has created a dire situation that calls for swift and decisive action.To address the pressing issues of the current crisis, the need of the hour is a strategic intervention by the Indian Army. This intervention has become indispensable to eradicate the illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation that has become the root cause of much of the present turmoil.Manipur’s ongoing ethnic tensions have severely impeded the efforts of the state police in combating the illicit drug trade and executing the “War on Drugs.” Apparently, with an aim to restore peace, an Indian Army-administered buffer zone has been established to control the violence between the two warring factions in Manipur, but its placement has unintentionally facilitated an uninterrupted proliferation of poppy and cannabis cultivation in the hills. This inadvertent consequence has complicated the state’s fight against narcotics. The buffer zone’s strategic location has hindered the state forces’ access to the hill regions, allowing poppy and cannabis cultivation to flourish unchecked.With the approaching poppy harvest season in the winter, from December to February, the situation is poised to worsen. The entire mechanism for these illicit activities is presently cranked up and poised for this upcoming harvest. If the harvest is successful, then all the illicit activities associated with the drug industry will escalate without restraint. The buffer zone’s unanticipated repercussions have emboldened cultivators and traffickers to operate with impunity. This undermines thestate’s anti-narcotics efforts and necessitates immediate action to prevent an even more significant crisis from unfolding.Given the intricate complexities of the drug trade and the operational expertise of the Indian Army, its intervention has become a paramount necessity.The army’s resources and logistical capabilities are uniquely suitable to dismantle the drug cartel infrastructure supporting this illegal trade. The urgent need for elimination of illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation aligns with the state government’s commitment to combating drug-related problems and also sends a resolute strong message to traffickers. First, it would send a clear message to the drug traffickers that their activities will not be tolerated.Second, it would weaken the nexus between drug trafficking and militant activities. Third, it would improve the security and stability in the State of Manipur. Close cooperation between the state and central governments is crucial for the army’s effective intervention. Timely and accurate intelligence sharing is pivotal to identify high-priority areas for dismantling illegal plantations.The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in India grants significant authority to the Army when operating in designated “disturbed areas.” However, it’s ironic that these powers, instead of being unrestricted, seem to be subject to directives from the central government. A striking example is the current situation in the hills of Manipur, where illegal poppy plantations are thriving, seemingly with the knowledge of the nearby Army deployments.Surprisingly, the Army is choosing to look the other way, citing the need for specific orders from higher authorities before taking action, despite the rampant illicit drug activities in the state. Unfortunately, this seems to be the implicit stance of the currently deployed Army in the said buffer zone in Manipur.More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024This raises a fundamental question:Shouldn’t the Army have the autonomy to independently respond to unlawful activities in AFSPA-governed regions? On the other hand, the Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force operating under the Ministry of Home Affairs, has a significant history of providing assistance in the Northeastern region of India. This force has played a crucial role in both natural disaster relief efforts and combating the drug trade in the area.In 2005, they conducted a massive rescue operation in the wake of a devastating earthquake in Sikkim, saving thousands of stranded individuals. In 2016, during severe floods in Assam and Meghalaya, they provided essential relief and assistance to affected victims. Similarly, in 2017, they rescued hundreds of people trapped in the aftermath of landslides in Manipur, showcasing their commitment to aiding civilians in times of crisis.In addition to their disaster relief initiatives, the Assam Rifles has actively engaged in combating drug trafficking in the Northeastern region. Notable recent instances include a joint operation with the Manipur Police in December 2022, resulting in the seizure of a significant quantity of drugs valued at Rs 500 crore in the international market in Moreh town, Manipur. In January 2023, they successfully intercepted a consignment of heroin worth Rs 200 crore in Mizoram, followed by the apprehension of a drug smuggler in Nagaland in February 2023, along with a substantial consignment of heroin valued at Rs 100 crore.Unfortunately, it’s worth noting that, at present, there appear to be no such ongoing activities for the destruction of poppy and cannabis plantations in the hills of Manipur where AFSPA is implemented. Since the outbreak of violence on March 3rd, the state government’s “War on Drugs” initiative has come to a halt, and the involvement of the army in this regard is yet to be seen.When confronted with such unlawful activities within AFSPA-designated regions, the appropriate protocol is clear: the Army must expediently inform the central government and await specific directives. The central government, in turn, shoulders the responsibility of responding impartially and void of political motives. In navigating the intricate landscape of illicit activities like poppy and cannabis plantations within AFSPA-designated areas of Manipur, the central government’s actions must be guided by principles of fairness and neutrality.Ensuring that decisions align with the best interests of the populace rather than catering to political agendas is crucial. The central government must exercise restraint and avoid exploiting the AFSPA’s authority for ulterior motives. Failure by the Central Government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue explicit and timely orders for army intervention raises a troubling possibility of government involvement in perpetuating the drug trade and ethnic violence. The silence or inaction of these governmental bodies could be interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the ongoing illegal activities that pose a threat to Manipur’s security and harmony.In the event that the Indian Army hesitates to carry out orders from the Ministry of Home Affairs, it may lead the public to question the army’s involvement or complicity in the drug trade. Given the Indian Army’s esteemed reputation for integrity, it is imperative that they demonstrate an unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and national security by adhering to legal directives aimed at eradicating illegal activities.If the Indian Army undertakes the task of eliminating the illegal poppy and cannabis plantations, it is crucial that this intervention is thorough and comprehensive. Breaking the backbone of ongoing violence requires the complete removal of every trace of these illegal plantations. To ensure transparency and accountability, impartial third-party observers should be appointed to oversee the operation. This measure will bolster public trust and safeguard the operation’s legality and ethical integrity. By eradicating illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation comprehensively and effectively, the Indian Army can not only dispel suspicions but also contribute significantly to the peace, security, and well-being of Manipur.(Dr Marc Nongmaithem is an informed/concerned citizen who loves to write on issues of public importance.

echoes-of-elegance,"Octogenarian Natsankritan Maestro Reminisces a Dazzling Manipuri Cultural Symphony at Royal Albert HallReport by Waari Singbul NetworkAmidst Manipur’s vibrant celebration of “Sankirtana Day,” Yumlembam Gambhini Devi, a revered octogenarian luminary in Nat Sankritana, warmly and nostalgically retraced the footsteps of her enthralling performance, a dazzling spectacle of this revered Manipuri ritual, at London’s illustrious Royal Albert Hall.This remarkable tale of artistry and cultural exchange spans four glorious decades yet remains etched vividly in her memory.The significance of this cherished moment amplifies against the backdrop of UNESCO’s prestigious acknowledgment of Manipuri Sankirtana’s profound cultural value by inscribing it as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”.  India boasts of 14 such heritage inscribed by UNESCO, including Natsankritan.The announcement during the eighth session of the “UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee” in Baku, Azerbaijan, in December 2013, solidified the timeless legacy of this heritage.It’s a legacy deeply ingrained in Manipur’s very essence, Sankritana, conceptualized by the visionary King Bhagyachandra Singh in the 18th century, a beacon of tradition handed down through formal teachings and rich oral lore.Sankirtana transcends the mere realms of music and dance; it embodies an ancient resonance, uniting communities, fostering social harmony, and nurturing spiritual unity among the Vaishnavites of the state.It is this enduring legacy that Yumlembam Gambhini Devi’s recollections poignantly echo—a testament to the elegance and cultural significance of this treasured art form.Its mesmerizing rhythms and spiritual essence continue to captivate generations, bridging the past, present, and future in a harmonious symphony of cultural continuity and artistic brilliance.Gambhini, gracing the ‘Sankirtana Day’ at Shri Shri Ramji Prabhu Mandap in Imphal East district, fondly recounted the vibrant journey of a cultural troupe from Manipur, herself included, that captivated audiences across England, including the prestigious Royal Albert Hall in 1979.“During those three exhilarating days, our 16-member ensemble brought to life various cultural gems—folk dances, Ras Leela, and more—at the grand Royal Albert Hall,” Gambhini reminisced.More Stories like thisDeep Focus recalls lifestyle during 60s, 70s and years…Dec 19, 2022Museum dedicated to Manipuri Dancer-Scholar Savitadidi Mehta…Dec 13, 2022Northeast Autumn Festival in Lunghar Village Beckons YouSep 22, 2022“As the singer for the Basanta Ras, I vividly remember the culminating moments of our performance. The audience, spellbound by our artistry, fervently requested an encore,” shared the Padma Shree awardee.“Standing amidst the stage, we were all awestruck by the thunderous applause and unified plea. Our revered Guru, the late Shri Priyogopal Sana, former director of the Jawaharlal Nehru Dance Academy in Manipur, urged me to sing for an additional 4 to 5 minutes to satiate the audience’s fervor,” recounted Gambhini, a popular resident of Yaiskul area in Imphal West.“Before commencing my impromptu rendition, I glanced up to the balconies where numerous onlookers peered through binoculars, adding to the surreal atmosphere of the enormous hall. Then, in the divine style of Nat Sankirtana, I delivered a soul-stirring devotional song,” she continued.“The resounding applause from the audience remains etched as a crowning memory, a testament to the deep resonance of that unforgettable Royal Albert Hall performance,” concluded Gambhini, her voice carrying the echoes of that cherished moment through the passage of time.Joining in the reminiscent chorus, the traditional Manipuri Pung (drum) maestro, Rajkumar Ratankumar, a fellow member of the Manipur cultural troupe in England, fondly echoed the splendor of their collective performance at the revered Royal Albert Hall.In her reflections on Nat Sankirtana during her active performing days, Gambhini delved into its historical roots.Recalling its earlier nomenclature as ‘Maha Sankirtana,’ she emphasized how, in its prime, the essence, ethos, and aesthetic values of this art form were as boundless as the vast ocean itself.“Before the eras of modern adaptation, Sanskrit and Bengali were the mediums for Sankirtana’s expression until our revered Gurus and experts translated it into Manipuri,” she further elaborated.“Reflecting on the grandeur of those bygone days, Gambhini recounted how a multitude of Sankirtana artists—singers and drummers—participated, ranging from 16 to 50, depending on the grandeur of the temple mandap or stage,” shared the maestro.“Expressing concern over the dwindling numbers of performers and the perceived reduction in its aesthetic essence, Gambhini earnestly appealed to the young Sankirtana aspirants, urging them to uphold and nurture this age-old art form,” her voice tinged with a sense of urgency and conviction.“In a momentous gathering, acclaimed Manipuri filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma, who played an instrumental role  in the inclusion of Nat Sankirtana on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, graced the Sankirtana Day observance as the chief guest. Alongside art and culture commissioner M Joy Singh presiding over the cultural function at the shrine  of Shri Shri Ramji Prabhu in Imphal East.Aribam Syam underscored the paramount importance for the government’s active role in preserving this invaluable art form,” concluded the commemorative event, leaving an indelible mark on Manipur’s cultural legacy.In these heartfelt recollections and impassioned pleas lies a call to safeguard the essence of Nat Sankirtana. Let these shared memories inspire the preservation of Manipur’s cultural treasure, ensuring its timeless resonance for generations yet to come."

Given the comments made by the Editor in the cable television channel and the consequent violation of his home and personal purity imply the tacit adoption of this principle of nihilism in the governance mechanism.By Amar YumnamThe Public have been feeling for quite some time if the current provincial government of Manipur functions on the principle of nihilism. What has just happened with Hemantakumar Ningomba, the Editor of a Manipuri daily, has only strengthened the veracity of this suspicion; he expressed or conveyed in the public domain what has been the unexpressed public knowledge relating to drugs in Manipur. Now the so-called clarification by the head of the Imphal East District police administration, presumably consequent upon the widespread public criticism, that Ningomba had made certain statements which were not to their liking. Now this statement from the District Police confirms the presence of nihilism as the basis for functioning. The police has taken over the jurisprudence as well and thus could violate the sanctity of the home of Ningomba on the basis of what they had felt. Given the comments made by Ningomba in the television channel and the consequent violation of his home and personal purity imply the tacit adoption of this principle of nihilism in the governance mechanism.As Sheldon Wolin (1961) put:”The designation of certain activities and arrangements as political, the characteristic way we think about them, and the concepts we employ to communicate our observations and reactions—none of these are written into the nature of things but are the legacy accruing from the historical activity of political philosophers.” After attaining the nature of the polity, it is imperative that a continuous process is put in place such that the attained nature of the polity is sustained. In other words, the work does not end with the attainment of democracy, but it has to be forever accompanied by a process of democratisation. This is why so much emphasis is put on the proper understanding of deliberative democracy.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024The significance of this deliberative process was long emphasised as early as the fifth century BC as the foundation for transparent decisions based on high quality deliberations; this is what we called public opinion. In an eulogy for  Athens and the Athenians, Pericles talked in a funeral oration in the middle of fifth century BC: “Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well: even those who are mostly occupied with their own business are extremely well-informed on general politics – this is a peculiarity of ours: we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all. We Athenians, in our own persons, take our decisions on policy or submit them to proper discussions: for we do not think that there is an incompatibility between words and deeds; the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences have been properly debated.”The significance and sustenance of the respect for public opinion to sustain democracy necessarily imply the assurance of core freedoms to the public (Rostboll, 2008). First: “Democracy as popular sovereignty: The only way in which we can be free in society is to be authors of the laws to which we are subject. Democracy aims atconvertingan inevitable dependence into freedom (Rousseau).” Second: “Democracy as instrumental to negative freedom: Democracy is required in order to protect a form of freedom that in itself is prepolitical or outside political activity. Democracy aims atprotectingan already understood and demarcated freedom.” Third: “Democracy as instrumental to personal autonomy: Participation in democratic politics creates citizens with autonomous characters. Democracy aims totransformindividuals into autonomous persons.” Fourth: “Democracy as intrinsic to freedom as praxis: Participation in democratic politics is a form of freedom. Democracy aims atcreating a new experienceof being free.” These freedoms would ensure continuous participation in deliberations and sustain the continuous process of democratisation.Respecting and sustaining this democratic process enables a healthy maintenance of the bridge between politics and policy. Now this bridge has to be founded on certain values. The functional quality of this bridge would be displayed in the various areas of government action. While every government would promise for doing good for the public, it is the manifestation of the underpinning values which would enable the public to assess whether a particular policy is good or bad. Till about the turn of the century, the common perception was that “If politics is about who gets what when and how, and public policy is the delivery mechanism, there would seem to be little to be gained by worrying about a values dimension in public policy.” But various pretentious programmes have caused not only caused loss of lives but the demise of democracy as well.  Thus, examination of the foundational values of any policy is now highly emphasised. While I would come back with more on the issue of policy values later, let me agree with Jenney Stewart that values may be the Motivators for working for a policy and values may be the basis for the choices made.In fine, the ways things are happening in the relationship between the government and the governed in Manipur’s democracy, I am afraid (a la Stenner: 1998) if we have a governance led by “one who cannot treat with natural ease or generosity those who are not his own kindred or kind, who is inclined to believe only “right-thinking” people should be free to air their opinions, and who tends to see others’ moral choices as everybody’s business – indeed, the business of the state. It is about the kind of people who – by virtue of deep-seated predispositions neither they nor we have much capacity to alter – will always be imperfect democratic citizens, and only discouraged from infringing others’ rights and liberties by responsible leadership, the force of law, fortuitous societal conditions, and near-constant reassurance.”(Amar Yumnam isVisiting Professor, CESS, Hyderabad.)"
invasive-alien-species-in-larger-climate-change-discourse,"The IPBES opined that the ‘economic repercussions of biological invasions are predicted to quadruple every decade, and, therefore, initiating proactive and decisive actions on emergency mode is crucial to curtail the adverse effects of invasive alien species (on ecosystems)’By Salam Rajesh“Climate change will have direct and second order impacts that facilitate the introduction, establishment and the spread of invasive species”. This hard-hitting statement comes from a study by scientists looking at the interconnectivity of climate change process and invasive alien species within ecosystems, with the larger perspective on biodiversity loss and impacts on livelihoods.Authors Burgiel and Muir in their study ‘Invasive Species, Climate Change and Ecosystem-Based Adaptation: Addressing Multiple Drivers of Global Change’, under an initiative of the Global Invasive Species Programme, observed that, “Climate change impacts, such as warming temperatures and changes in CO2 concentrations, are likely to increase opportunities for invasive species because of their adaptability to disturbance and to a broader range of bio-geographic conditions and environmental controls”.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2002) estimated that the mean surface temperature had increased by around 0.6 degree Celsius on average over the past century, and by the next century it predicted that the global average warming as compared to the pre-industrial era will be between an increase of 1.1 to 4.6 degree Celsius, which is of course alarming. This comes in the backdrop of observed increases in ocean temperature with an estimated average increase of 0.10 degree Celsius between 1961 and 2001 (IPCC, 2007b).The connection between accelerated temperature rise and increased phenomena of invasive species is seen in sequestration impacts on important ecosystems. For instance, the study emphasized that invasive species “may have a feedback effect that further exacerbates climate change. Invasive species can compromise the ability of intact ecosystems to sequester carbon which helps offset greenhouse gas emissions”.In short, large scale spread and proliferation of terrestrial and aquatic invasive plant species can have considerable impact on the carbon sequestration capacity of forest and wetland ecosystems.Two other key messages in the study forewarned that, “Invasive species can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to other climate-related stressors and also reduce their potential to sequester greenhouse gasses”, while suggesting that, “Using an ecosystem-based adaptation approach, these pressures on ecosystems and their ability to provide important services can be offset by preventing the introduction of new invasive species and by eradicating or controlling those damaging species already present”.In-between, an assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) observed that given the assumption that nations continue on a business-as-usual attitude to the emerging issue, an anticipated increase of 30 percent in alien species will occur by the year 2050 if preventive measures are not taken up in time.Furthermore, the IPBES opined that the ‘economic repercussions of biological invasions are predicted to quadruple every decade, and, therefore, initiating proactive and decisive actions on emergency mode is crucial to curtail the adverse effects of invasive alien species (on ecosystems)’.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Burgiel and Muir’s study assessed that the estimated damage from invasive species worldwide totals more than 1.4 trillion USD annually – which is, 5 percent of the global economy – with impacts across a wide range of sectors including agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, transportation, trade, power generation, and recreation.Quite interesting is the fact that an aquatic plant species that is seen commonly in most water bodies – the water hyacinth – features as one of the most pervasive alien invasive species across most continents. As much as hyacinths have some beneficial properties, they are considered as nuisance plants in Manipur’s water bodies, and equally find bad mention across India, Bangladesh, Asia, Europe and the Americas!Native to tropical and subtropical South America, water hyacinth has been present in the African Great Lakes since the late 1980s, and was first reported in Lake Victoria in 1990. Presumably, the free-floating perennial aquatic weed thrived and spread over time due to its fast growth rate and surrounding anoxic and high nutrient water conditions. Boats, machinery and water currents aided the distribution of water hyacinth while human carriers spread it as ornamental flowering plant. It is believed British officers brought hyacinths to India as ornamental plant.Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), originally perceived as a practical problem for fishing and navigation, is now considered a threat to water availability, and biodiversity. In fact, hyacinths are currently considered as one of the world’s worst aquatic weeds. Recent research on how water hyacinths respond to climate change has implications for the continued spread and management of a known invasive weed that is present in 50 countries across five continents.Scientists studying the process of spread of hyacinths across most water bodies throughout the globe opined that one of the most important impacts of water hyacinth is water loss, where this aquatic plant significantly increases water loss by high rates of evapo-transpiration, as much as 2.7 to 3.2 times greater than water loss in open water.The impact of the highly invasive water hyacinth is also far-reaching, insomuch as it interferes with fishing activities, boating, irrigation, water treatment, hydroelectric power, human health, tourism, and on the water bodies’ natural ecosystem. This evidently is observed in Manipur’s inland freshwater Loktak Lake which is over-ridden by several alien invasive species of semi-terrestrial and aquatic plants.Dense mats of water hyacinth evidently interfere with the traditional fishery in Loktak Lake as it reduces the open water body available for the fishing activities while hampering in movement of the fishers in their traditional dugout canoe. Mass accumulation of water hyacinth acts as breeding ground for mosquitoes that may transmit malaria, and could contribute towards other water-borne diseases.The more perflex suggestion based on projections of various climate change factors is that water hyacinth could likely expand its global distribution with increased temperature rise. Providing an example, scientists opine that water hyacinth is currently established in parts of southern Europe but could readily expand to the rest of the Mediterranean Basin and further northward into Europe pending rates of global warming (EPPO, 2008).Scientists studying the process also opine that the ‘uncertainty over the role of El Niño raises additional questions about the implications for climate change on water hyacinth’. Research studies suggest that ‘warmer temperatures in the region will have adverse impacts on water hyacinth as its growth rate is retarded above 30 degree Celsius’, while others indicate that ‘increased carbon dioxide concentrations can increase the biomass of water hyacinth under controlled conditions’.The several deliberation on the subject matter comes up with the suggestion for measures like prevention of new introductions; close the pathways for the unintentional introduction of non-native species; conduct risk assessments of proposed introductions of non-native species that include bio-geographical factors and potential climate scenarios; and to develop early detection and rapid response systems targeting likely pathways and points of introduction, taking into account climate change dynamics.The other suggested measures are simplified, that is, eradication and control: eradicate invasive species already present in a system where feasible; control known invasive species and as necessary damaging native species if eradication is not feasible; and to monitor known invasive species as well as suspect non-native and native species with the potential for biological invasion.In view of the national and global concerns on invasive species as inducing biodiversity loss, impacting livelihoods and contributing to climate change process, Manipur Government needs to come up with a state policy on how to deal with the issue. Loktak Lake, as well as most water bodies in the State, is already deep in trouble from invasive species."
mohfw-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-home-isolation-of-mild-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases,"Patient under home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after at least 7 days have passed from testing positive and no fever for 3 successive days and they shall continue wearing masks. There is no need for re-testing after the home isolation period is over.TFM DeskGovernment of India, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) has issued a revised guidelines for Home Isolation of mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.As a background to the guidelines, MoH&FW said that over the past two years, it has been seen globally as well as in India that majority of cases of COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Such cases usually recover with minimal interventions and accordingly may be managed at home under proper medical guidance and monitoring.Ministry of Health & FW has thus issued and updated guidelines for home isolation from time to time to clarify selection criteria, precautions that need to be followed by such patients and their families, signs that require monitoring and prompt reporting to health facilities.The present guidelines are applicable to COVID-19 patients who have been clinically assessed and assigned as mild /asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.Asymptomatic cases; mild cases of COVID-19The asymptomatic cases are laboratory confirmed cases who are not experiencing any symptoms and have oxygen saturation at room air of more than 93%. Clinically assigned mild cases are patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms with or without fever, without shortness of breath and having oxygen saturation at room air of more than 93%.Patients eligible for home isolationThe patient should be clinically assigned as mild/ asymptomatic case by the treating Medical Officer.

manipur-likely-to-go-to-poll-during-covid-19-third-wave-peak,"The state on Tuesday breached the 5% safe threshold on Covid test positivity rate set by the World Health Organisation and reported 116 fresh cases.TFM ReportEven as electioneering has heated up in Manipur with the declaration of poll schedule, the state has shown a steady upward trend in the daily Covid-19 cases. The state on Tuesday breached 5% safe threshold on Covid test positivity rate set by the World Health Organisation and reported 116 fresh cases.According to the state government’s Covid-19 common control room, In the last twenty-four hour, 99 persons (63M, 36F) from general population and 17 personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) were confirmed as new COVID-I9 positive cases. All necessary medical precautionary measures like containment and contact tracing are in place.As per district wise details, the highest number of positive cases was reported from Imphal West with 39 infections and followed by Imphal East (25) and and Churachandpur (21). The rest were reported from Thoubal (4), Bishnuper (2) Kakching (3) Tamengkong (1) Tengnoupal (1) Kangpokpi (3), Noney (1), Ukhrul (1), Senapati (5) and Chandel (1). Kamjong and Pherzawl are two districts where no infection has bveen detected in tests conducted on 12 and seven samples repectively.In the last 24 hours, the State Level Covid 19 Deaths Audit Committee has reported one Covid-19 death taking the toll to 2012. The deceased had co-morbidities and had one dose of Covid vaccine, it added.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024The number of active cases is 539 (General Population-465 and Central Security Personnel-74) The recovery rate is 97.98.%. As on Tuesday, 10,10,506 persons got both the doses and 590 got precautionary doses.The Election Commission of India has banned road shows, pad-yatra, cycle/bike/vehicle rally and procession, physical rally of political parties or probable candidates or any other group related to election till January 15, 2022 in view of the rising number of COVID cases in the country and concern for the Omicron variant. The Commission said it will subsequently review the situation and issue further instructions accordingly.The election commission said physical rallies during the campaign period as and when permitted after the decision of the Commission shall be conducted subject to adherence to extant COVID-19 guidelines. The maximum limit of persons allowed for Indoor and outdoor rally/meeting shall be as per existing direction of respective SDMAs.However, since the day the election commission had announced the poll schedule and restricted election-related gatherings, Covid cases are steadily on the rise. The crest of the third wave is likely to overlap with peaking of the election campaign.As per ECI announcement, Manipur assembly elections will conducted on two phases. First phase voting is scheduled for February 27 and the second phase March 3. Last date for filing nomination for phase-I is February 8 and for phase-II February 11. Scrutiny will be held on February 9 and February 14 for phase-I and phase-II respectively. Counting of votes will take place on March 10.Meanwhile, experts have predicted the peak of the third wave between February 1 and 15. According to a preliminary analysis by IIT Madras, India’s R-naught value which indicates the spread of COVID-19 was recorded at 4 this week, suggesting a very high infection transmission rate. Dr Jayant Jha, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras, said that as per their estimate, the peak in the current wave is expected to come between February 1-15 and it is expected to be sharper than earlier peaks.If their prediction turns out to be correct, Manipur will go to polls at the peak of covid-19 third wave."
palm-oil-a-perilous-project,"For whom is the project? A very loose response from the state authority may be, this monoculture will improve state economy. The response sounds irresponsible in the absence of substantial supports and evidence.By Jinine LaishramchaWhere is Manipur up to? Has she been dying? What does one see by looking at the ever-increasing socio-political-economic degeneration ranging from flourishing corruption to crime and violence, from crumbled education to deploring environment, from free-float drugs to abandoned economy?If it is not the case of dying virtually, it is of drying literally. Drying of water at the source-places after a prolonged destruction of natural environment and deteriorating the forests is what we have been witnessing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s palm-oil project in Manipur at his visit to Imphal on 4 January 2022 pops up here. For the simple reason that water comes from forest where rain is absorbed by the plants then they release slowly in the spring holes. The drying of the springs and natural fountains in the hills and foothills around has been a reality bite for Manipur now. Modi’s proposal will rub salt into the wound because the palm-oil plantation will accelerate drying up of the water-sources sooner than expected, pushing Manipur to a water scarcity and a water stress zone. Modi is ignoring the already deteriorated environmental reality in the region, he has brought up palm-oil on the spotlight. This is a contrary to the cordial policy and work for fulfilling the water supply for irrigation and household needs.What is Palm-oil?It comes from the fruit of a palm tree originated in Africa. Two types of oil can be produced; crude palm-oil comes from squeezing the fleshy fruit, and palm kernel oil which comes from crushing the stone in the middle of the fruit. Indonesia and Malaysia make up over 85% of global supply. Besides used as edible oil, palm-oil is used increasingly in the cosmetic industry and sometimes used as bio-fuel across the world.India’s interest:India is at present the world’s biggest importer of this oil. It brought in 7.2 million tons of crude and refined palm-oil worth $5.1 billion in 2020, according to UN data. Of this, 93% was from Indonesia and Malaysia. On 15 August 2021, Narendra Modi announced a support of Rs 11,000 crore to incentivise palm-oil production. The government intends to bring an additional 6.5 lakh hectares under palm cultivation. Of this about 2.5 lakh hectares are from the northeastern states.Adversities:Palm cropping is a monoculture which only palm trees occupy a vast land, needs to keep 30 feet-gap between each tree, not allowed other plants to grow along. It never becomes a scientific and good agricultural undertaking for many reasons. According to experts and bad experience from Indonesia and Malaysia, the plantation causes deforestation, long term soil deterioration, destroys water sources, terminates natural habitat, and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Since this monoculture yields questionable outcomes, an international body called the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil or RSPO was formed in 2004 in response to increasing concerns about the impacts palm-oil was having on the environment and society.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024First: A principal requirement is what the benefits and losses could be. As a common sense criterion for such plantation the government should display a white paper in public available for comments and consultations from the interested sections of people. It will determine the propose work whether will be carried out or not. If the losses are bigger than the benefits, definitely it must not be executed. In order to go with fair regularity towards not to damage the environment and ecology, the government should not be blind to Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Report a requirement set by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).Moreover, the government-authority should extend UN human rights principle of Free Prior and Informed Consent – An Indigenous Peoples’ right and a good practice for local communities which means public should be given fair opportunity to know well enough about the pros and cons of the projects and to voice their needs and to share their opinions.Second: For whom is the project? A very loose response from the state authority may be, this monoculture will improve state economy. The response sounds irresponsible in the absence of substantial supports and evidence. For example, who will get the benefits, the local farmers and people or corporates from outside, or all of them. Then, how much the local community will get, how will they get it? For whom is the development? Answer is from what we learned in the past, from the Loktak Hydro Electric Project and Ithai Barrage.Again, some ministers, contractors, bureaucrats and armed groups are to snatch unfair shares somehow in the process especially on negotiation.   Then company namely, Godrej Agrovet Ltd, Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd of Patanjali group and 3F Oil Palm Agrotech Private Ltd will extract the maximum of the project.In Mizoram, the lack of a collecting centre in the vicinity is a challenge for the farmers. If they want to sell palm-oil fruits, they have to drive 30 kilometres to West Phaileng in Mamit district, incurring heavy transportation charges. Because of this, many farmers have given up the cultivation of palm- oil and switched to areca, pineapple and banana which are easier to sell. But for some, it is difficult to make the switch because they were so emotionally invested in this cropping.Third: Mizoram has planted palm trees in about 29,000 hectares as the biggest producer in the Northeast. From our next door’s experience it confirms that palm is a highly water-consuming crop with each plant needing about 300 litres of water per day, about 45000 litres of water per hectare every day. In addition to its impact on biodiversity, palm-oil is also a significant threat to soil fertility. According to C. Zohmingsangi, from Mizoram University, who is studying soil biology around palm-oil plantations in Mizoram – nutrients, enzymes and carbon are found in much lower percentage in the soil after palm cropping than other types of forests.Manipur and other northeastern states are part of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. They are home to some 8,000 flora species, 35% of which are endemic. There are nearly 2,200 species of fauna, of which 24% are endemic. The overwhelming consensus among environmentalists is that palm-oil is detrimental to such rich local ecology of the northeastern India.Fourth: If the foothills of Manipur are dumped for the palm-oil, the undertaken will be regretted for that matter sooner than later. The reason is that perfect residential colonies can be extended in and around such scenic surroundings. For it will leave the agricultural paddy fields to the valley and restore the wetlands and waterbodies that people have occupied. Also, the foothills will be a solution to the ever bulging residentials demand for the communities who tend to contest often in the congested space in the valley.Finally, there are a good bunch of eco-friendly projects that can be alternatives to such questionable palm-oil cropping. Integrated farming, horticulture, medicinal plants, bamboo, hemp so on and on can yield better than this perilous palm. Why on earth do the state and its agents fail always to execute such? If they are sincere and committed, a green heaven on our native soil that economically prospective, contributes to restore forests and water-sources is possible.(Jinine Laishramcha isAssistant Professor at the University of Suwon, South Korea)"
finding-a-pathway-for-freshwater-diversity-conservation,"In the Loktak wetland setting, the local fishers under the lead of the All Loktak Lake Area Fishers Union, Manipur, recently initiated a move to identify a section of the wetland and protect it as a ‘fish sanctuary’ with the motive for regenerating fish population in the lake through measures like preventing over-harvesting, netting of fingerlings, off-season closure during spawning period to encourage increase in fish production naturally, and the reintroduction of indigenous species.By Salam RajeshFreshwater diversity is amongst the most threatened in the world, with freshwater fish being particularly vulnerable, writes authors Suman Jumani, Vanessa Hull, Parineeta Dandekar and Neethi Mahesh in their ground-rooted article “Community-based fish sanctuaries: untapped potential for freshwater fish conservation” (Cambridge University Press, 2022).This reflection comes from the assessment that “Riverine systems and associated fish populations worldwide are threatened by human impacts, especially in tropical countries with emerging economies”. The threats as in this context are basically identified as ‘pollution, destruction of riparian habitats, sand mining and destructive fishing practices’.In India, and elsewhere, community-based fish sanctuaries are a key mechanism for the conservation of freshwater fish populations. These sanctuaries hold great potential for the conservation of rare fish species in India, but are subject to myriad threats at local, regional and global scales.Temple-based fish sanctuaries, community-based protected fish sanctuaries, and other informal privately managed fish sanctuaries strive to protect and regenerate fish populations to some extent, and sometimes serve to contribute towards protection of endangered species – more pronounced in the temple-based sanctuaries.As in many other parts of the world, Manipur is no exception on the issue of freshwater diversity degradation and loss due to factors that are primarily human oriented. Most of the wetlands and rivers in the State have abjectly been subjected to many forms of abuse, including high level of pollution, physical modifications, sand mining in river beds, stone quarrying in watersheds, reclamations, and encroachments amongst other activities.Many of the wetlands in the State are presently in pitiful conditions, either partially degraded or fully reclaimed for different human activities, thus affecting the freshwater diversity that these water bodies sustained in a past time. With the loss in wetlands, it obviously is ascertained that species known and those yet unidentified are lost to science and to humanity.Conservation-based fish reserves are examples of local communities self-organizing to manage a common natural resource for sustainable use. Defining community-based fish sanctuaries as ‘complex social–ecological systems’, the authors of the study opines that, “Well-managed fish sanctuaries have the potential to contribute to the in-situ conservation of freshwater fish, other aquatic biota and riparian habitats whilst also providing socio-cultural benefits. Sanctuaries can function as riverine protected areas, protecting not only fish and biotic communities but also entire reaches of riparian habitats”.In the Loktak wetland setting, the local fishers under the lead of the All Loktak Lake Area Fishers Union, Manipur, recently initiated a move to identify a section of the wetland and protect it as a ‘fish sanctuary’ with the motive for regenerating fish population in the lake through measures like preventing over-harvesting, netting of fingerlings, off-season closure during spawning period to encourage increase in fish production naturally, and the reintroduction of indigenous species.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Looking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024The initiative, however, has not taken root as a reason of legal entangles vis-à-vis the definition of the rights of the local fishers over their ‘territory of life’, with the State imposing restrictions under a recent law that ironically ‘seeks for the conservation of the lake’.In the Manipur situation, changes in the land use pattern for the wetlands, including different human activities that impact drastically on the water bodies, have induced degradation and degeneration of the wetlands. Many of the wetlands are presently in conditions of abstract neglect, with some at the verge of ‘un-natural’ death through reclamations and conversion for commercial activities, farming and low-scale industries.The study authors opine that, “Given that community-based initiatives can achieve in-situ conservation whilst circumventing excessive spending and bureaucratic processes, there is an urgent need to tap into their conservation potential”.The study wraps up with the emphasis on expediting ecologically sensitive conservation measures on this note: “Given their socio-ecological importance, sanctuaries should be integrated into broader conservation efforts and recognized in official decision-making processes, impact assessments and development planning”.This latter submission of the study authors, however, is a process that has been fairly controversial in Manipur, given the fact that in most cases involving rights, land tenure and extension of ‘protected areas’ such as sanctuaries, the decision-making process has been virtually unilateral, closely knitted to the conventional top-down model of planning and decision-making.The various organs of the United Nations, such as the World Conservation Union, has since been emphasizing on the proactive participation of local people, more specifically Indigenous peoples, as co-partners in conservation, a move that seeks to do away with the ‘fortress conservation’ model of the Government.The fortress conservation model excludes Indigenous peoples, and local communities, from involving directly in the State’s measures on ‘protection and conservation’ of forest and wetland ecosystems, while in the process seeking to displace local people from their traditional roots. This system has been at the root of most conflicts of interest between States and the local people, more emphatically those who directly depend on these ecosystems for their living.Other than the human factor, the study also looks at a broader scale beyond the river system, such as the threats from global climate change that affects fish sanctuaries. The study authors opine that, “Global warming has caused an increase in extreme climatic events, including more frequent and severe droughts and changes in rainfall patterns and intensity. These changes are expected to alter stream flows, increase stream drying, reduce hydrological connectivity and increase maximum water temperatures, which in turn affect endemic fish communities, especially in intermittent streams”.At the end of day, it is not only about meeting challenges from Government policies on land and water uses, whereas, the bigger gamble is on the larger issue of climate debates which likely may impact on species to a level where already many species of plants and animals have been labeled either as ‘extinct in wild’ or ‘highly endangered’.The focus, as in the study, now centers on to what length Government policies can enable local communities to come up with ecologically friendly conservation measures that helps revive species and regenerate forest and wetland ecosystems – to meet the needs of future generations, as the UN puts it.(The writerlooks at environmental stories through the journalistic lens.He can be reached at[email protected])"

It aims to create a strong network for the preparation of nomination documents for India’s intangible cultural heritage (ICH) under different conventions, with the goal of broadening the diversity of ICH representation from India.A two-pronged methodology is adopted for this workshop including the Academic- Capacity Building via a combination of presentations, lecture demonstrations, relevant literature and resource material and Experiential-Capacity Building through case studies, interactive sessions, cultural performances etc.The workshop has a target audience and participants including the in-service professionals of culture sector of the regional government/ULBs/district administration, faculty representatives of History/Culture/archaeology/anthropology/ethnography/Musicology and alike of state and regional central universities with participations from the NGOs, organizations, unions, associations, trusts for artists, ICH practitioners, and the ICH advocacy groups.Terming the inaugural programme as “prolific”, guest of the inaugural programme of the 3-days orality festival, commissioner and secretary, art and culture, Nagaland, Athel O Lotha, said that the following remaining two days would a “days” would be an event where cultural diversity of the state could be an sustainable opportunities which cannot be ignored accordingly to the very “intangible cultural heritage” manifested earlier in the multiple domains including oral traditions, and in a way in expressions, performing arts, social practices, and including rituals and festivals, knowledge, nature, and traditions making Nagaland along with their sister states of the northeast an “inheritors” of the unique traditions and cultural which they are being identified and recognized as culturally rich people worldwide.Citing that the “popularization threats and social transformation” alongside the conditions of giving rise to “disappearances and destruction” to the intangible culture of heritage in particular owing to lack of resources for safeguarding such heritage, Athel mentioned that the indigenous communities play an important role in production, safeguarding members, and in recreating the “intangible cultural heritage” thereby assisting to enrich the culture and humane diversity and creativity of the people.The noble initiative of the ministry of culture, government of India (GoI), in chipping in for the 3-days event, she said was for capacity building including workshops for raising awareness and engagements in the said cultural heritage involving multiple stakeholders where they coming together as representatives of a “resolute state” in a “crucial moment” when cultural preservation could not be understated where she also hoped the two remaining days would be able to “plant” the much needed seeds of significance and holistic maintenance of the intangible cultural heritage in the present modern times.MLA and advisor, Law and Justice, land revenue, Nagaland, TN Manen, who attended the inaugural programme as guest and also as a member of the INTACH, Nagaland, said he was honoured and privileged to be part of “the Listeners-the festival of orality”, and also to share the insight of the festival.Adding that the people are in such a transition adapting accordingly to the fast-changing times or in a digitalized and technologically advanced world which according to him is a “crazy world” in the midst of the “craziness”, the MLA and retired bureaucrat expressed that holding the kind of literature festival specially in Nagaland could be a “refreshing experience” not to retrospect into what the Nagas were to look beyond while also adding that Nagaland state being bestowed with very rich diverse culture and they believing in they believing in “unity and diversity” but he however lamented that unfortunately some of the Naga traditions is “re-packaged” and badly threatened which unless rediscourse and renew on what the Nagas are known as worldwide, he also hoped that very soon the “misinformation” with regard to the Nagas would be erased from the society.Head of the UNESCO chair in language policies for multilingualism, Federal University, Santa Catarina, Brazil, Professor Dr Gilvan Muller De Oliviera, in his keynote address said that language is very important to be a part in sharing through the kind of platform being organized.He being thankful to be part in the midst of the many Naga intellectuals and learners, Dr Gilvan Muller also disclosed that the UNESCO has identified the very culture of the Nagas though it might take sometimes to work on the documentation.Dr Muller later released the INTACH book while also launching the digital archive of the Northeast India Indigenous People’s Archive (NEIIPA), accompanied by principal, Tetso College, Sovima, Chumukedima, Dr Hewasa L Khing.Earlier, L Somi Roy, Imasi Foundation Imphal, Manipur, welcomed the gatherings, invocation chants were led by Guru Sangyusang Pongener, of Ungma Village, and Guru Chubatozung, of Chuchuyimlang village, while the theme song was presented by renowned Naga musicians, Tiameren Aier, and Lenen.Vote of thanks was proposed by the festival director, INTACH,

The judgement had drawn criticisms from various quarters, including the Supreme Court. Several organisations led by the All Manipur Tribal Union had moved the High Court on May 3, seeking permission to file a third-party appeal against the March order.The High Court order of March 27 last year, which was made public in April, played a key role in triggering the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Meitei and the tribal Kuki-Zo communities in Manipur compelling the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024In October last year, a division bench of the Manipur High Court had agreed to hear an appeal filed against the controversial order.The appeal was moved by the All Manipur Tribal Union and various groups who argued that groups associated with the rights of the tribal community were not a party to the writ petition in which the 2023 direction was passed.The original petitioners – in whose case the direction was passed by Justice Muralidaran, filed a review plea before the High Court, in which the Meitei petitioners submitted that an “innocuous” direction in the March 2023 order may have to be modified considering the delicate nature of the issue.The review petitioners still sought for the State to consider the inclusion of Meiteis in the ST list, but added that it was completely up to the wisdom of the State to take a call on the issue.On Wednesday, Justice Golmei Gaiphulshillu of the High Court said that the paragraph in the order needs to be reviewed. “I am satisfied and of the view that the direction given at Paragraph No. 17 (iii) of the Hon’ble Single Judge dated 27.03.2023 needs to be reviewed, as the direction is against the observation made in the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” the court noted."
outlining-ambitious-national-target-for-ecosystem-restoration,"The UN is presently in the midst of its Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), a global commitment that UN secretary-general Antonio Gueterres had said is ‘running out of time’.By Salam RajeshAn ambitious roadmap to achieve the global vision of a harmonious world with nature by the target year 2050 was deliberated upon, debated and duly framed during the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at Montreal (Canada) in December 2022. This in short is the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.The framework broadly aims at halting and reversing biodiversity loss by the target years 2030 to 2050, with four overarching goals to be achieved by 2050. The goals, focused specifically on ‘ecosystem and species health’, define the need to halt human-induced species extinction, sustainable use of biodiversity, equitable sharing of benefits, and a methodology to close the financial gap of 700 billion USD per year.The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is not a legally binding agreement but countries that have signed up to the agreement commit to demonstrating progress in meeting the stated targets outlined in the agreement, and thereto update their commitment to their respective National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAPs).In tune with this global agenda, India’s National Biodiversity Authority worked with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in November last year to discuss and come up with the country’s National Biodiversity Targets. This took place at a national consultation on ‘the updation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and the adoption of the National Biodiversity Targets in alignment with the GBF’.Amongst the many thematic deliberations was one that specifically focused on ecosystem restoration which currently is a priority target for global forums functioning under the umbrella of the United Nations. The UN is presently in the midst of its Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), a global commitment that UN secretary-general Antonio Gueterres had said is ‘running out of time’.The Global Target 2 under the GBF is focused on ‘Ensuring that by 2030 at least 30 percent of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration, in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity’.To achieve the mission, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework is focused on creating ‘Awareness on the indirect and direct drivers of environmental degradation, the promotion of innovative tools and technology for restoration, the inter-state and inter-agency co-operation and facilitation, and in achieving support of urban and rural populations’.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024Plunging deep into the deliberation, the national consultation last year did admit that, “Eco-restoration in a most populous, and mega-diverse country like India with enormous diversity of natural ecosystem and habitats is challenging as this subject is in infancy and emerging”.This pushed the resolution that a well-coordinated and concerted participatory effort with committed financial investments is urgently required to achieve the national goals in line with the global targets. The consultation stressed that “A dedicated scientific institution on ‘eco-restoration’ with state-of-the-art facilities is the need of the hour”.The consultation further came to the conclusive thinking that ‘National and State level policies, laws, guidelines, rules, schemes and action plans relevant to forest, wildlife, environment, water, wetland, river development, coastal and marine ecosystems, and agriculture need to be developed with due emphasis on the development, implementation, support and monitoring of inbuilt programs towards restoration of degraded ecosystems (terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine ecosystems)’.This comes down to the reasoning that ‘All sectors, implementing agencies, corporate, industries, and local bodies are required to substantially invest on restoration of degraded ecosystems and ensure that at least 30 percent degraded ecosystems (terrestrial, inland waters, and coastal and marine) are under active restoration by the target year 2030 (extendable to 2050 at the most to meet the global target of limiting temperature rise by 1.5 degree Celsius by 2050)’.On a broad perspective, ‘degraded ecosystems’ relates to ‘the degradation of ecosystems from several underlying causes over a long period of time’. The national consultation therefore opined that, ‘the majority eco-restoration (e.g., inland wetland, coastal and marine ecosystems) invariably requires cooperation, transfer of technology, and financial support from all sources’.While stressing the need to ‘Plan, adopt and execute resolute actions to enhance and restore ecosystem services and the ecological integrity of degraded ecosystems’, the consultation re-emphasized on the important aspect that ‘the vital spatial and temporal connectivity (landscape level; wildlife corridors; river – longitudinal, vertical, horizontal, and temporal connectivity; and interconnections between land and sea) are restored for enhanced biodiversity values, and ecosystem functions’.The national consultation advocated for coming up with innovative approaches that incorporate ecosystem-based approaches, nature-based solutions and modern technologies, so as to ‘reduce traditional resource dependence and overexploitation of natural resources by people and industries in general, and promote alternate income generation activities and develop substitutes for ecologically sustainable raw material’.This concept invariably focuses on the need to re-think on “Human sustainability, social sustainability, economic sustainability and environmental sustainability” if at all a cent percent successful roadmap is to be realized at the end of the target year. Sustainability in all of its forms, whether addressing human needs or for biodiversity loss recovery entails a smart methodology that looks at both the scientific and empirical dimension of ecosystem restoration while partnering with Indigenous peoples and local communities specifically on their traditional knowledge, wisdom and age-old experiences.Searching for a fool-proof methodology, the national consultation suggested few indicators, such as, the trends in forest cover, the trends in aquatic ecosystems, the trends in mangrove cover and coastal area management, the trends in river water quality, and the trends in afforestation and restoration’ with suggestive methods on ‘combating desertification, species recovery, and the maintenance of fertility in agricultural lands using natural methods and means’.This is further broken down to ‘Headline indicators’ specifying the area(s) under restoration;  ‘Component indicators’ specifying the extent of natural ecosystems by type, and the maintenance and restoration of connectivity of natural ecosystems; and ‘Complementary indicators’ specifying the habitat distributional range, large mammal landscapes, intact wilderness and climate stabilization areas, increase in secondary natural forest cover, priority retention of intact wilderness areas, status of Key Biodiversity Areas, and finally, the Red List Index.All said and done, the importance of re-working the NBSAPs for all States in the country becomes vital in understanding the present status of ecosystems across all landscapes – mountains, forests, wetlands, freshwater and marine, grasslands and high-altitude meadows. The NBSAPs need to be re-structured, prioritized and made functional in the best sense of the word to achieve the goals stated in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, with of course a reflection on the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement."

framing-a-concretized-policy-for-indigenous-peoples-globally,"In Manipur, as in most regions where Indigenous peoples’ lands have been largely affected by extractive industries and other exploitative ventures by States and their agencies, the principle of FPIC has hardly been followed or respected, partially or wholly.By Salam RajeshIssues on discrimination over State policies on resources exploitation from traditional lands of Indigenous peoples around the world has been one of the most pervasive issues globally, often resulting in intense forms of conflicts of interest between local people and State agencies including investors and resource extractors.The issue has been in focus at the United Nations platform in these past several years with Indigenous peoples’ representatives from around the globe lobbying hard for a universal policy that respects the fundamental rights of all marginalized sections of people particularly clubbed under the nomenclature ‘Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs)’.The issue is to figure prominently during the Ad Hoc Open-ended Intersessional Working Group on Article 8(j) and the Related Provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity at the twelfth meeting of the Working Group under the broad umbrella of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at Geneva during the 12th to 16th of next month.The meeting’s thematic agenda “Development of a new program of work and institutional arrangements on Article 8(j) and other provisions of the Convention related to indigenous peoples and local communities” is crucial for the IPLCs in the face of strong objections from various State lobbies who could be evidently impacted by such a global decision aimed at protecting the traditional land holding system and the fundamental rights of the IPLCs.Section 4 of the work plan seeks to ‘EncourageParties (to the Convention) to engage with indigenous peoples and local communities as on-the-ground partners in the implementation of the Convention, including by recognizing, supporting and valuing their collective actions and respecting their indigenous and traditional territories and their efforts in applying, preserving and maintaining their traditional knowledge, innovation and practices in relation to promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity’.At the same time, Section 5 of the proposed work plan seeks to ‘UrgeParties (to the Convention) to fully involve indigenous peoples and local communities in the preparation of national reports and in the revision, update and implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans aligned with the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’.Section 6 of the proposed work plan of the CBD specifically stresses that the ‘Traditional knowledge, innovations, practices and technology held by Indigenous peoples and local communities should only be used with the Free, Prior and Informed Consent of Indigenous peoples and local communities’.It further stressed that ‘The use of traditional knowledge should be subject to the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use and application of such knowledge, innovations and practice based on mutually agreed terms in accordance with domestic law and with due consideration of the customary laws, community protocols and procedures of Indigenous peoples and local communities’.The focus of the work plan is ‘to promote, within the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity and in alignment with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the implementation of Article 8(j) and other provisions of the Convention at the local, national, regional and international levels and to ensure the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities at all stages and levels of its implementation’.More Stories like this3rd North East Games: Nagaland leads medal tally on Day 1Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 20243rd North East Games 2024 kickstarts with musical…Mar 19, 2024Reflecting upon this concern of the IPLCs on the issue, the international organization Cultural Survival in its recent report “Securing Indigenous Peoples’ Right to Self-determination: A Guide On Free, Prior and Informed Consent (2023)” stressed that ‘the full and effective participation of Indigenous peoples and local communities, in particular Indigenous women, girls and young people, should be ensured, from the local to the global level, in all stages of the identification, implementation and monitoring of the elements of the program of work’.The emphasis stressed is on the principle of FPIC (Free, Prior and Informed Consent) and for the States and their agencies to respect human values. Cultural Survival emphasizes that FPIC “ensures Indigenous Peoples’ right to give or withhold consent to any activities that affect their lands, resources, and territories”.The right to FPIC flows from the Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination. It encompasses and protects all rights of Indigenous Peoples, including land rights, collective rights, participatory rights, cultural rights, food and water security rights.The principles of FPIC form a framework that informs the protocols, processes, rules, and regulations that Indigenous Peoples can require from companies, governments, and other sovereign nations when designing investments and infrastructure projects on Indigenous lands.In Manipur, as in most regions where Indigenous peoples’ lands have been largely affected by extractive industries and other exploitative ventures by States and their agencies, the principle of FPIC has hardly been followed or respected, partially or wholly.In the year 2007 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted theUnited Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples(UNDRIP) wherein the declaration recognized the Indigenous peoples’ individual and collective rights and making specific mention of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as a prerequisite for any activity that affects Indigenous communities.Similarly, during 2018 the United Nations’ Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples identified ‘respect for FPIC protocols as central to the conduct of good faith consultations’. This assertion comes from the argument that in most cases ‘investors and government officials would carry out “a consultation” as an opportunity to merely inform a community that an investment or development project will be happening’.Cultural Survival argues that ‘Investors may arrive for the first time accompanied by government officials who tell the community that “they are being consulted” and demand an immediate “yes”. In such situation, project developers do not allow time for an Indigenous community to discuss the potential project internally, seek independent advice, gather information, and then make a decision, privately and according to self-determined practices’.The assertion reflects very closely to the current endeavour of the State to go for the controversial oil palm cultivation in different parts of the State without going through a proper process of FPIC in the very first place.The concern is also on whether proper Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) are conducted or not. ESIAs predict the environmental and social consequences of a future project. Many countries have laws requiring that potential investors undertake impact assessments.Impact assessments are carried out by technical experts who assess the likely impacts of a proposed project and subsequently offer recommendations on how to avoid or reduce any negative impacts on the local environment – including air, water, and soil quality – and on the health and overall well-being of the to-be-impacted local community.Manipur Government and its concerned State agencies hopefully will adhere to the principles outlined in the proposed work plan of the CBD in all matters related to schemes and projects that could impact negatively on the natural landscapes and other biodiversity sensitive pockets of the State, including forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems."
the-case-of-the-minority-tribes-caught-in-the-social-milieu,"During the early 1990s when Manipur was caught in an intense violent conflict situation between the Naga and Kuki, two major tribal communities, many of the minority tribes were caught in the social milieu, unintentionally drawn into the conflict with pressure upon them to identify themselves as ‘affiliated’ socially and politically to either of the conflicting tribal communities.By Salam RajeshIt has been a long standing dispute on where the minority tribes in Manipur stand at the crossroad of social and political milieu in the State especially when it comes to defining their position and status in the socio-political setup, with a glaring statement on the external pressures from various parties seeking or demanding the social and political affiliation of the minority tribes to dominant tribes, sometimes under duress.This writer has long been associated with almost all of the minority tribes in the State, whether for ethno-culture studies or for community-led protection and conservation of forests that otherwise had been fairly neglected by the State.In a nutshell, many of the minority tribes are often than not caught in a complex situation of identifying themselves socially and politically with dominant tribe communities when it comes to crucial decisions on political divides as in times of flare ups amongst the different ‘ethnic’ communities settled in the State.The level of social identification often comes in line with sharing affinity with particular majority tribes, in terms of language, dress and customs, belief system, and by virtue of being located in pockets that are dominated by majority tribes. The social identification is again often determined by the question on avoiding conflict of interest with the domineering tribe community upon whom the minority tribe has certain dependence in terms of access to resources and for socio-political safeguards.During the early 1990s when the State was caught in an intense violent conflict situation between two major tribal communities, many of the minority tribes were caught in the social milieu, unintentionally drawn into the conflict with pressure upon them to identify themselves as ‘affiliated’ socially and politically to either of the conflicting tribal communities.The response to this was typically the voice of the “Indigenous”, in the sense that almost all of the minority tribes came up with up their individual assertion stating that they belong to neither of the conflicting majority tribal communities, instead having their own individual social, cultural, and political identity. The follow-up call to both warring communities was to let them alone in their own social and political setup.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024In the month of May flare up between two major communities earlier this year, many of the minority tribes were again facing the same issue as in the 1990s when they were caught up in the social milieu, entangling in a complex situation where they were unwilling parties. Their concern is that they have nothing to do with the current conflict situation between the two warring communities.The most recent incidence was the strong protest from the Aimol tribe wherein the tribe denied any linkage with the Kuki tribe community – socially, culturally and politically – as was alleged by a representative of the Kuki Inpi Manipur. The assertion of the tribe was to let them alone, neutral to the present socio-political crisis. This was fairly similar with the tribe back in the early 1990s when they were forced to issue a clarification that they have their own individual identity and must not be linked to any other tribal socio-political organization.There was a similar incidence happening with the Kom tribe community in the 1990s, and in the present crisis, when they were under pressure from dominant tribe communities to identify themselves with particular dominant tribal community. The Kom, as similarly as the Aimol, stood their stand asserting their individual social, cultural and political identity.Another of the minority tribes in Manipur – the Kharam tribe – was literally caught in the crossfire from both the Kuki and the Naga tribe communities during the violent ethnic crisis in the early 1990s. In fact, the Kharams had to stand guard against possible attacks from either of the conflicting tribe community, one end of the village being barricaded to withstand attack from the Kuki and the other end of the village standing guard to withstand attack from the Naga. It was the proverbial Catch-22 situation for the tribe whose total population is just around a thousand individuals.In the present crisis, Chiru villagers from the Kangchup Chiru village had to seek safety in the foothills away from the comfort of their homes, anticipating themselves as likely to be caught in the crossfire with Kuki militants raining down bullets on Phayeng village below from the upper reaches near their village. In armed conflict situation, the risk ran high of being caught in the milieu, more of being a minority tribe unable to resist dominant tribe community’s push for area domination.Not very long back there was a move by the minority tribes to form a common platform in asserting their individual social identity. The Kom, Chiru, Chothe, Kharam and Purum amongst others lent voice to the social platform Komrem Union in asserting their social identity, way away from the Kuki or the Naga socio-political platform. It is another story that the fabric of the Union broke down after some time, as differences in opinion and ideology went either ways.The gist of the story is that the political divide amongst the tribe communities in the State is largely determined by the geographical distribution of the tribes, in particular the minority tribes who are sandwiched between large swath of area that are predominantly settled by the dominant tribes, thus socio-politically and demography-wise the minority tribes are inclined to seek the support of the dominant tribe in their vicinities.In conflict situations, the minority tribes are often caught in the milieu unable to decide upon whom to lean for support. Assertion of their individual socio-political identities have come with a cost, sometimes under tremendous pressure (that is, evident threat from the gun-culture) to declare their stand in favour of particular dominant tribe community. Resisting this would amount to confronting the might of the dominant tribe community. In the end, they are stuck in the quickmire, unable to resist or come out from their social milieu.(The writeris an independent journalist based in Imphal.He can be reached at[email protected])"
manipur-unrest-give-thought-to-your-choice-during-elections,"As a youth, we must understand the complexity of the issue happening in our beautiful State. We must dive deep into the core issue. We must not blindly follow what our elders are doing till now… To conserve our future, we must campaign for NOTA, until we find the right person.By Loya-Ngamba SapamIn the aftermath of the battle of Gettysburg, the American Civil War’s deadliest battle, Abraham Lincoln made an address contouring the ideal and mechanism of democracy. In his speech dedicated to the martyrs of soldiers, he famously pronounced democracy is a government “of the people, by the people and for the people”. His speech evoked the essence of the people in the democratic form of government. It clearly laid down the inevitable fabric that connects the government and its citizens. This fabric is not a mere superficial but rather, a deeply intertwined between the electors and their elected representatives in the nation’s assembly or parliament.Loosening the fabricThe intertwined fabric, which is the basis for having a successful democracy, gets saggy or loosened up between the electors of Manipur and their elected representatives in both Houses of Parliament. The state has been reeling under the deadliest ethnic conflict in its history between the Meitei, a prominent valley-dweller, and the Kuki, one of the hill-dwellers. However, their elected representatives, who should convey people’s plight, remained mute not only in one session but in two consecutive sessions of the Parliament, both monsoon and winter sessions. It transpired when the people in the State protested, demanding to speak up and raise the issue of deleterious crisis to the Parliament. In some interviews, one elected representative claimed that he was being gagged by some externalities. So, he had to drop the people’s will to raise the matter to the Parliament. This not only disconnects limited to the state’s elected members of parliament (MPs) but also manifests among the other MPs as well.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024The session adjourned several times in both Houses of Parliament, particularly the monsoon session, literally without any fruitful debate over the crisis in Manipur, even though the session was held at a time when there was a huge crisis in the state. The people were butchered, their bodies mutilated, women paraded naked and fueling hatred by the social media platforms. The lack of concerted efforts to have a debate in the Parliament reflects the tardy approach of elected MPs to contain the wildfire, particularly the MPs in the ruling party. This apathy makes the people in the State feel the wicked stepmother attitude of the parliament. This will prolong the wound of persistent unfair treatment and discrimination faced by the people of the North Eastern States of India, especially by the people of Manipur. In the long run, the unfair treatment of the Parliament will create resentment or bitterness among the people, particularly the youth affected by the crisis. It has seeded the plant of bitterness, which will further the regionalism and may pose a threat to the social and political integration of the nation. The already broken link between the electors and their elected MPs became widened due to ineffective and inefficient handling of crises by the governments at the Centre and State.In fact, the inefficiency of BJP-led governments at the Centre and State has been credited for stretching the ethnic conflict. So far, the state government led by Biren Singh has not rolled out a specific policy approach to contain the crisis. Many lives would have been saved if the government deployed effective measures and strategies. The wound is deep but, the government is giving only the first aid. A crisis of such magnitude needs not only lip service but also concrete and well-laid-out plans. The policy must focus not only on short-term but also long-term strategies.The NOTA campaignWhen the people of the State were being beheaded, butchered, murdered, mutilated or women were raped and paraded naked, dishonoured their dignity, school kids were captured, tortured and even not able to find their dead bodies, the MPs in both Houses, both in government or Opposition, turned their blind eyes and didn’t turn up when people are asking for their help to resolve the crisis. Why should we still vote for merciless people? Why should we exercise our right guaranteed under Article 326 of the Indian Constitution to elect such a person who turned a blind eye during our needs? Moreover, reports have shown that 43% of MPs in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were linked to criminal cases, why should we give power to people who committed crimes? We need to rethink our electoral choices. Isn’t it worth exercising our choice to NOTA rather than to merciless criminals? To conserve our future, we must campaign for NOTA, until we find the right person.As a youth, we must understand the complexity of the issue happening in our beautiful State. We must dive deep into the core issue. We must not blindly follow what our elders are doing till now. The complexity will grow further if we don’t give thought to our choice of vote. It is time to question whether the candidate filing for MPs or state assembly is right or wrong, whether the candidate is coming to serve the people or harm the people, or whether she/he is coming to have personal gain or not and many more. We should ask as many questions as possible to make a correct decision. If we don’t find the right feat for our candidate, why don’t we go for NOTA? It is better to live in an ordered state, rather than to live in a state governed by merciless criminals. In addition to putting an end to community animosity, the collective “right decision” will inspire a new generation of leaders who will be able to carry out the wishes of the people.(Loya-Ngamba Sapam is an alumnus of IIT Delhi and can be contacted at[email protected])"

loktak-fishers-call-for-ban-on-night-fishing-with-led-lights,"The ALLAFUM’s secretary said that the population of fish in Loktak Lake had declined sharply in recent years affecting the livelihoods of the Loktak fishersTFM DeskPushing on with its agenda of community-led conservation of Loktak Lake along with protection of the wintering migratory water birds, the All Loktak Lake Area Fishers Union, Manipur (ALLAFUM) called for the ban on activities within the lake that undermine its conservation objectives.Outlining the negative approaches of local fishers using LED lights to fish illegally within the core area of the lake, the ALLAFUM’s secretary Oinam Rajen Singh reminded the union’s earlier call for banning the practice within the immediate vicinity of the lake waterbody under the broad supervision of the fishing community settled at Champu Khangpok Floating Island Village.Speaking to media persons on Sunday, Rajen pointed out that due to several factors, including blocking of the traditional passage of migratory fish population by Ithai Barrage — a component of the Loktak Hydroelectric Power Project — and overharvesting by local fishers using various means of fishing techniques, the population of fish in Loktak Lake had declined sharply in recent years affecting the livelihoods of the Loktak fishers.The necessity to earn their livelihoods had forced many local fishers to devise different means of catching fish, whether sustainable or not, said Rajen. The recent practice of fishing at night time using LED lights is not only leading to overharvesting of the fish whereas it is adversely affecting the feeding ground of the wintering migratory water birds that come to the lake between October and February every year, he added.More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024It may be recalled that local fishers had recently started using LED (Light Emitting Diode) devise, a semiconductor diode normally used in electronic displays, indoor and outdoor lightings, to attract the fish with the bright lights and Loktak Lake had appeared like a city with lights at night time. The practice attracted the local authorities’ attention as entirely negative to the traditional fishing practices of the Loktak fishers.The night fishing with hordes of brightly-lit LED lights and the subsequent human activity in the core area of the lake is scaring away the wintering water birds, said Rajen, stressing that this negative practice needs to be halted in order to protect the long-distance flying migratory water birds and to prevent the over harvesting of fish in the lake through negative practices.Along with the call for a total ban on night fishing with LED lights, the union’s secretary reiterated the Union’s call for closed season during January-February to prevent overharvesting of fingerlings during the spawning period.The local fishers must restrict their fishing activities to sustainable method of fishing to prevent over harvesting of the fingerlings, said Rajen, adding that the fishers must refrain from using closely knitted fishing nets of mesh size 10 and 13 so as to avoid catching the fries and newly spawn fish.The Union is also against the practice of catching fish using battery-operated dynamo-apparatus which is entirely an undesired practice as it shocks and kills not only fish but other life forms including amphibians, insects and planktons, the Union’s secretary said. He warned that the members of the Union are always vigilant of apprehending locals using dynamo to catch fish illegally.The fishing community of Champu Khangpok floating island village in the midst of the lake is shouldering responsibility for preventing the abuse of the lake and for the long-term conservation of the lake including its biological diversity as the fishers have a high stake being entirely dependent on the lake’s resources for their living and sustenance, the secretary informed.The Loktak Development Authority must take proactive role in designing and ensuring an effective strategy for the management and conservation of the lake with the support of the Loktak fishers so as to achieve meaningful conservation of the lake and to prevent biodiversity loss, Rajen said."
eliminating-light-pollution-essential-for-ecological-integrity-and-human-health-iucn,"The IUCN report cites the example of the Hortobagy National Park, the second largest alkaline grassland in Europe, which covers 82,000 ha on the flood plain of the Tisza River. The Park managers established lighting regulations based on the RASC/IDA Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting, ensuring an environment free of light pollution, which is highly essential for the wildlife thriving in the Park.By Salam Rajesh“Light pollution is the human-caused alteration of outdoor light levels from those occurring naturally. It threatens ecological and commemorative integrity, interferes with amateur and research astronomy, degrades the appreciation of mythologies and cultural practices related to the night sky, mars wilderness experience and landscape beauty, carries risks to human health and wastes energy”.The statement comes as a process of an emerging campaign by international bodies for the elimination of light pollution across the globe, as is outlined in the IUCN publication “The World at Night: Preserving natural darkness for heritage conservation and night sky appreciation” (2004).Light pollution is a relatively new area of deliberation in an obscure region like North East India where there is less of discussion on the proceedings of the subsidiary bodies of the United Nations, far more pronounced in Manipur particularly where the State is yet to deal appropriately with issues on air and water pollution.The IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020, at its session in Marseille, France, had specifically called upon its member organizations and the specialized Commissions to work towards reducing light pollution globally.The world body while urging all concerned to ‘ensure the protection of the nocturnal environment’, appealed to all of its member organizations and agencies for the ‘management of land and water areas to develop, disseminate and implement engagement, education and outreach programs to explain the harmful impacts of light pollution, the benefits of preserving natural darkness, and the methods to reduce light pollution’.With the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development of France in the lead, the IUCN plunged into action to reduce light pollution reminding member organizations that ‘the impacts of artificial light at night affect many biological groups, both flora and fauna, vertebrate and non-vertebrate, and affect the functioning of ecosystems and the free services that they provide to human societies, including pollination’.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Loktak Fishers Observe International Rivers DayMar 14, 2024The IUCN report emphasizes that ‘birds are seriously affected by light pollution. They may suffer navigation problems from night lights during migration and become disoriented, tending to fly toward bright lights. The death toll from collisions with lights or brightly lit windows and buildings has generated public concern over the accumulation of dead birds at the base of brightly lit towers. Their feeding habits, particularly of those that eat flying insects, can suffer from the effects of light pollution on their own behaviour as well as that of the insects upon which they feed’.The report further stresses that ‘insects, too, suffer disorientation and death from attraction to artificial lights. Their numbers also decrease as they congregate under bright lights and become easy prey for insect-eating birds. Insects suffer losses due to the interruption of their normal breeding habits by light pollution.On this very note, the report points out that ‘the impacts of light wavelengths on biological groups are very diverse (e.g. orientation, growth, phototaxis, circadian clock, activity modification) and that a biological group can be affected by several types of impact’.The IUCN report is also specific on the fact that ‘artificial lighting disrupts the orientation of many animal species with severe adverse effects (marine turtles, migrating birds, etc.) and reduces the quality of habitats and connectivity within landscapes, with consequences for the viability of populations.The IUCN report cites the example of the Hortobagy National Park, the second largest alkaline grassland in Europe, which covers 82,000 ha on the flood plain of the Tisza River. The Park managers established lighting regulations based on the RASC/IDA Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting, ensuring an environment free of light pollution, which is highly essential for the wildlife thriving in the Park. Hortobagy supports 159 nesting species and 178 regular or irregular visiting species. Every year around 100,000 to 300,000 grey geese (Anser spp.), 100,000 cranes (Grus grus), and 50,000 to 200,000 shorebirds stop at Hortobagy.Citing a case study in Manipur’s Loktak Ramsar site which is an important feeding ground for thousands of transboundary migratory water birds flying in along two international flyways – the Central Asian Flyway and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway – the fishing community of Champu Khangpok Floating Island Village, a unique floating island village within Loktak Lake, raised a campaign to halt the illegal practice of night time fishing using brightly lit LED lights. The campaign had two-prong appeal: first, stop overexploitation of the fish resource, and secondly, stop disrupting the migratory water birds in their feeding season.Taking advantage of the covid-19 restrictions, which nonetheless impacted the livelihoods of the locals drastically during the lockdown period of 2020 and 2021, there was profusion in night time fishing with LED lights, literally turning Loktak into a ‘city of lights’. The Champu Khangpok villagers’ relentless campaign significantly checked the undesired practice, with now only a few erring fishers here and there on the sly.Taking a leaf out of the Hortobagy experience, the Loktak Lake managers requires to strategize a policy for ensuring strict compliance to regulations and halt any form of activity that contributes to light pollution, especially within the Loktak Ramsar site during the migration period of the long-distance flying water birds, many arriving from European destinations, from Siberia and the Far East.It may be recalled that until the year 2012, light pollution as a subject of concern did not feature in any of the IUCN conventions. During the Members’ Assembly held as a process of the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2012 in Jeju, Republic of Korea, a motion to adopt a recommendation “Dark skies and nature conservation” was introduced by the InterEnvironment Institute, a US-based IUCN Member.The motion moved by the international organization was based on the work of the IUCN Dark Skies Advisory Group, part of the Urban Conservation Strategies Specialist Group of the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). Similarly, the Members’ Assembly as part of the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020 in Marseille, France, adopted a strong resolution “Taking action to reduce light pollution”. This since, has paved the path for a larger discussion on light pollution as detrimental to ecological integrity, wildlife, and human health in general."

PEC urges the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate in order to shed full light on the circumstances of these murders and to identify those responsible. It also urged the Israeli commanders responsible on the ground to distinguish between civilians and combatants and respect the press emblem worn by journalists. The forum also asked the media companies to exercise cautions so as not to endanger their employees."

The relief camp, which is housing 886 internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the ongoing Kuki-Meitei conflict, is fully dependent on firewood for daily cooking needs. The team also visited Sawombung pre-fabricated facilities where one extra LPG stove was provided in the community Kitchen 1 and 3 respectively.It is estimated that about 20 to 30 truck-loads of firewood were used in a month in these 100 to 130 relief camp community kitchens. With the use of LPG gas for cooking, overall cooking time and cleaning time by inmates would be reduced significantly. Energy-efficient LPG gas will reduce the carbon footprint of the kitchen. With the LPG facilities, the inmates can prepare breakfast for school-going students, which otherwise individual family bears at additional cost and time, said the statement.Narrating the Journey of the “Meiri”, it said while visiting Oksongbung relief camp of Bishnupur district on September 30, 2023, a few volunteers felt the need for LPG facilities as large quantities of firewood were being used in these kitchens. Later it was followed by a group of like-minded people and implemented through Manipurtimes and Chakhum platform with the theme of “Chakhum-gi Meiri Mut-han-gumsi ” – The Flame of the Home & Hearth must remain alive.More Stories like thisPambei-led UNLF greets RPF on latter’s Raising DayFeb 25, 2024Bidyananda sent to police custody for five more daysFeb 10, 2024UNLF condoles demise of Pvt MongoljaoFeb 5, 2024With the information gathered from respective DC offices of Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur districts, 110 relief camps were initially identified without LPG facilities out of about 140 relief camps. A budget of Rs. six lakh and 200 burners were planned to fulfil this mission.A WhatsApp group was formed on October 10, 2023, and started inviting people through individual networking to join the mission. Social media platforms of Manipurtimes and Chakhum were effectively used for a larger reach and started campaigning on October 21, 2023.After the mission team was formed, the first relief camp visit was made on October 29, 2023 covering two relief camps of Moirang, Bishnupur district. Continuous efforts are made to get more funds for the mission and keep visiting more relief camps.While trying to reduce the cost, an order of 120 stoves was made through a firm at Kolkata. The challenges of the bulk transportation were supported by the Assam Rifle by air-lifting from Kolkata to Imphal, under special arrangement.With the passing days, many camps are found to be closed and merged with another and effectively. Few relief camps still prefer to use firewood for daily needs for cooking and hence LPG stoves were not provided to those specific camps.With the coverage of a total of 100 relief camps, the mission is declared completed as on December 25, 2023, said the statement."
amur-falcons-greeted-with-guns-and-rosettes,"Last week it was reported that four local hunters were detained by Tamenglong Forest Division officials and district police in one of the Amur roosting sites near Chuiluan village, while three airguns and 27 slain Amur Falcons were recovered from their possession.By Salam RajeshThe annual arrival of the long distance flying raptors Amur Falcon (Falco amurensis) in Manipur for their winter migration is being received with mixed response even as reports are emerging of local villagers hunting the migratory birds on the sly, and with wildlife enthusiasts expressing a sense of distraught feeling on the apparent neglect on the part of the State towards protection of the winged winter visitors and conservation of their roosting sites.Last week it was reported that four local hunters were detained by Tamenglong Forest Division officials and district police in one of the Amur roosting sites near Chuiluan village, while three airguns and 27 slain Amur Falcons were recovered from their possession. The incidence occurred amidst emerging reports of the raptors being poached and sold for their meat on the sly.Amur Falcons are trans-continental flying raptors, leaving the extreme cold of winter in East China to cross the vast spread of Asia, up and above the Arabian Sea and thence reaching the warm plains of South Africa for their winter rest. Along their long and stressed journey, the raptors take a breather amongst the lush green of North East India during October and November every year, feeding on their favourite food – termites – that are abundantly found in the bamboo groves along the banks of the mighty Barak River.Years back, the Amurs were recklessly hunted in thousands both in Nagaland and Manipur, two of the important roosting sites in the North East. It was the intervention of wildlife enthusiasts and concerned local groups that ultimately succeeded in halting the massacre of the winged visitors.In Tamenglong District, the campaign picked up in 2015 with concerned locals forming the Rainforest Club Tamenglong (RCT) to engage in both wildlife and forest conservation. The campaign particularly focused on the protection of the migratory raptors and the conservation of their roosting sites. The campaign was supported by the Tamenglong Forest Division officials and the district administration with equal zeal.More Stories like thisManipur Tops Chart For Largest Change In Net Warming During…Mar 20, 2024Integrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Then came the break of two years of Covid-19 between 2020 and 2021. It was literally hoped that the fear of the deadly virus would keep off the humans from defiling the spirits of the forests, and help propagate the wildlife. But, it seemed the hardship of the coronavirus spell is now forcing locals to rely on the sale of the Amur meat to recover on their financial crisis as a result of the pandemic.The half a decade of relentless campaign for the protection of the Amur Falcons seem to have taken a slight u-turn, as the recent arrest of the four hunters indicated. Amidst the worry, local volunteers are not happy with the lack of support from the State, in particular from the concerned department, towards the Amur conservation campaign.Two leading representatives of the Rainforest Club Tamenglong, Nehemiah Panmei and Dr Chambo Gonmei, both Honorary Wildlife Wardens of the District, recently wrote to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Dr AK Joshi regarding the issue, stating that “There has been a serious lack of such efforts, co-ordination and initiatives from the department this year” particularly concerning the reports of random hunting of the falcons and the lack of funding to keep the campaign rolling.Meanwhile, there has been a spate of notifications by the district administrations in Tamenglong, Senapati and Ukhrul Districts banning the hunting of the Amur Falcons during their winter stay in Manipur. The district administrations have also been urging the villages located in the roosting sites to either locked away the licensed guns or deposit them to the village authorities during this period.Despite the shortfalls and the frustrating news of the Amurs being hunted for their meat on the sly, the volunteers of Rainforest Club Tamenglong are not letting down their guards. With the increased arrival of the falcons in their thousands, the RCT volunteers are stepping up their campaign holding awareness sessions in various schools and colleges located in the district, encouraging the youths to take pledge for the protection of the winged visitors.At the country level, there are queries from different individuals and groups on the reported hunting of the raptors, expressing deep concern on the negative fallout of a people’s campaign that was hailed as largely successful towards protection of an important transboundary migratory bird species.It may be noted that at the global level there currently is an emerging effort to work on a transboundary landscape conservation model for the Amur Falcons, covering its breeding grounds in East China, Mongolia and East Russia, and its feeding grounds in Myanmar, North East India, Central India, and Africa – a collaborative campaign that could well be of significance in the entire world concerning several nations working together to save, protect and conserve a long-distance flying migratory bird species.The 13th Conference of the Parties on the Convention of Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) held at Gandhinagar in Gujarat during early 2020 specifically highlighted the conservation of the Amur Falcons as a priority process of the CMS under the United Nations platform. The CMS executive secretary had also specifically spoken on the Amur conservation in North East India as significant of the initiative.With national and international concerns pouring in for the Amur Falcons, local concerns are urging the Government of Manipur, and very particularly the State’s Forest Department, to step in urgently with appropriate funds and other supporting mechanism to boost the campaign for the long term protection of the Amur Falcons and conservation of their roosting sites."
two-day-echo-indias-immersion-training-organised-for-manipurs-senior-health-officials,"Speaking at the inauguration, Health & Family Welfare Minister Dr Sapam Ranjan Singh announced that ECHO India has confirmed to establish two well-equipped telementoring Hubs in Manipur within the next 60 daysTFM DeskHealth & Family Welfare Minister Dr Sapam Ranjan Singh inaugurated two-day for Manipur’s senior health officials in Imphal on Tuesday. The training was organised by ECHO India, a non-profit organisation revolutionising healthcare access and healthcare education across the country, in collaboration with National Health Mission (NHM) Manipur.

The sessions make information easily accessible and learning all the more insightful for healthcare workers. The comprehensive capacity-building programs facilitated by ECHO India have been a great learning opportunity for our healthcare workforce, allowing them to offer quality care and treatment to patients”.Talking about ECHO’s work in Manipur, Dr Haresh Chandwani, General Manager of Projects at ECHO India said, “Our collaborations in Manipur have always been geared towards strengthening the state’s healthcare infrastructure. To date, ECHO India has partnered with State Tuberculosis Cell (STC) Manipur and the Manipur Nursing Council, with the initiatives being focused on Tuberculosis treatment and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC).“Boththese partnerships are a unique example where ECHO India played a critical role as a catalyst as well as an enabler for health system strengthening, contributing to the capacity building of 700+ healthcare professionals,” he added.The official said that ECHO India which was established in 2008, is a non-profit organisation focused on bringing equity, primarily in the fields of healthcare and education through capacity building of healthcare practitioners and educators using ECHO’s ‘Hub and Spoke’ Model of learning; Hub being a group of experts who regularly mentor the learners (spokes).TeleECHO sessions are conducted by ECHO ‘hubs’ through basic, widely available teleconferencing tools, and the sessions involve primary care clinicians and healthcare workers (HCWs) from multiple sites presenting patient cases to teams of specialists and each other. In this manner, ECHO creates ongoing learning communities to support primary care clinicians and helps them develop necessary skills. This continuous loop of learning, mentoring and peer support makes the ECHO model unique and ensures a long-lasting impact.With a goal to touch 400 million lives in India by end of 2025, ECHO India has partnered with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, State NHMs (National Health Missions), Municipal Corporations, Nursing Councils as well as leading medical institutions across India including AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health & Neurological Sciences), NITRD (National Institute for Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases), NICPR (National Institute of Cancer Prevention & Research), Tata Memorial Hospital, and PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute for Medical Education & Research).ECHO India, along with its partners, has launched over 200 hubs and rolled out 350+ programmes covering more than 30 disease areas, which has led to the capacity building of over 700,000 providers across the country, said the offical."
culture-and-attitude-not-the-system-are-the-problems-in-manipur,"Many of the retired civil service officers who successfully worked hand-in-hand with their political bosses, mutually satisfying their vested interests, do also tend to enter into politics as post-retirement settlements to continue the vicious cycle of corruption in the state and societyByDeben BachaspatimayumOne of the major issues of the failing education system in Manipur, highlighted, in a recently concluded state level seminar on educational scenario of the state at Manipur University is: Corruptions in recruitment and posting practices. It would not be wrong to also assume that the same issue applies across all social services institutions in the state. Most of the staff in the top, middle and bottom level of government service institutions are there where they should not have been. We often come across staffs in the government offices who neither have the appropriate attitude, aptitude, and skills to do the jobs they are paid for. So, we have medical staff, teachers, police personal who conduct and behave with service seeking people according to their personal interests, whims, fancy, moods, and egos. Recruiting such misfits in all the government departments are great disservice to the people who elect the government, but they continue to be in the wrong places because they provide great service in sustaining the political bosses who appoints them. The same political class also blatantly come back to the people promising to check corruptions in the public offices after every five years.This flaw in the governance and administration of government offices under pressures of the political bosses has been pointed many times by some of the honest civil service officers after their retirements. They also expressed their frustrations on frequent interference and inducements by their political bosses in taking wrong decisions instead of the right ones based on the facts and figures and merits of the situations during their service tenures. But such honest officers are few. Let their numbers grow. Many of the retired civil service officers who successfully worked hand-in-hand with their political bosses, mutually satisfying their vested interests, do also tend to enter into politics as post-retirement settlements to continue the vicious cycle of corruption in the state and society – breeding mediocrity and sub-standard lives instead of creating social conditions for quality of life with dignity. This is not only local state-specific problem but part and parcel of a larger political system in India.This issue assumes extreme urgency of serious public attentions especially when we have witnessed how the politically corrupted State failed the Health System during public health emergency situations. Govt of India failed to prevent nearly five lakhs reported deaths due to Covid-19 pandemic through third waves even as the experts estimate much more unreported deaths in multiple times in the country. As on date Manipur counts 1,30,490 Covid-19 positive cases and 2027 total deaths showing 95.80% recovery rate during the same period. The systems and mechanisms of responding to the pandemic that were put in place during the first and second wave seems to remain either resistant to change to suit the nature of third wave or showing signs of fatigue. This is based on recent experience of having tested Covid-19 positive in my family.Three in my family tested positive. We all are double dose vaccinated. Right after the test result of member of my family came in I as a responsible citizen, took all six members of my family for covid test at the Art & Culture Dept building, Palace ground for three reasons. Next day 21stin the evening my wife and I were listed among the Covid positive as informed by Leikai Club Covid Response Team. Though it was in total disbelief, at least for me, we immediately took safety and precautionary measures to contain and isolate ourselves at home as the official SOP. All these happened without the Covid Control Room making any efforts contact us, directly. The following day on 22ndCovid Data center contacted us on phone and asked whether we are in home isolation and whether we have separate toilet facilities. I said, ‘yes, we are at home isolated from rest of the family but have only one shared toilet. Knowing that we have only one toilet they did not bother to ask whether we like to move to the Covid Care Centre but informed us that they are sending some medicines after assuring we have no other health complications and in return we were asked to submit two forms duly filled and signed, immediately. In the afternoon a staff from the local PHC delivered some tablets which included Vitamin C, Zinc, Bone-D3, Ivermectin and an Oxymeter with oral instructions which were passed on to us through another person in the neighbourhood. Soon after, I got soft copies of the two blank forms through my phone as reproduced here below. I was asked to handwrite the same, sign and submit:Form No.1: Undertaking by patient on self-isolation….Point-1: I ………………………….. S/W of …………………….. resident of ………………being tested as positive Covid-19 infection, do hereby voluntarily undertake to maintain strict isolation at home at all times for the prescribed period (without mentioning the period).Point-2: During this period, I shall monitor my health and those around me and interact with assigned surveillance team / with the State Helpline (1800-3453818) in case I suffer from any deteriorating symptoms or any of my close family contacts develops any symptoms consistent with Covid-19.Point 3:I have been explained in detail about the precautions that I need to follow while I am under self-isolation. I am liable to be penalized and persecuted under applicable laws for any non-adherence to self-isolation protocol.Form No.2: Hospital Admission Refusal formI …………………………….. have been advised by Dr. ……………………. that I need to go to hospital for urgent medical care and treatment.I have been fully informed about the risks and consequences of not going to hospital and these include:(set of summary of risks explained) …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..(no list of risks as stated is filled up, here)Despite this advice I have chosen not to go to hospital. I understand that this decision goes against the medical advice that I have received and will seriously compromise the care that can be provided to me.I accept sole responsibility for the consequences of thisdecisionReading through the two forms I was confronted with the flaws in the entire procedures I was asked to follow. Firstly, it is clear that not adhering to the instructions in both the Forms I will be liable for legal actions even after informing the help center that we had no separate toilet facilities for home isolation. No clear instructions on do’s and dont’s were also provided to me.More Stories like thisLooking at Hyacinths from a Global PerspectiveMar 13, 2024Brace for Record Warmest Year In CenturyMar 6, 2024Eliminating Light Pollution Essential For Ecological…Feb 28, 2024Secondly, more serious problem is with the Form-2 because in all the communication I have nowhere said I decide to stay home by refusing to go to the hospital for urgent medical care and treatment, but I have been reporting for the inadequate toilet facilities at home. I felt I was asked to own up a situation in which I have acted against the law which I did not commit. Even while I was trying to cooperate with the health personnel to seek proper medical advice for best care option all options were summarily closed while giving priority to getting the forms signed to complete certain formalities.Thirdly, medicines provided to us were nowhere mentioned in the two forms. It was passed on to us informally without any written prescriptions and physical examination of health situation of both of us. Reluctant to take the medicine since our health conditions was not worrisome, I checked the side effects of Zinc and Ivermectin tablets on the internet and found it was unsafe for us without proper medical checkup and advice. So, I texted the same Covid helpline center expressing my inability to sign both forms because the terms and conditions for which I should be undertaking the legal liabilities were not suitable to my case due to the flaw in the procedures. To my surprise instead of being helpful the attending staff at the helpline center texted me the following messages,Covid Helpline: “So according to this condition” (meaning, since I cannot sign the forms), “We can’t give your discharge paper”, “Since you denied”, “We won’t take any responsibilities”Then I wrote back: “We are not asking for any discharge slip. What we are asking is proper medical care and advice according to our house and health conditions as per the laid-out procedures”. “Get me line to the concerned doctor. Do not jump into your own decisions over the phone. You will be held responsible for procedural lapses.”Covid Helpline: “mind your language”I got disturbed and replied: “Is this the way you treat with Covid patients? Be careful”Covid Helpline: “If we didn’t give ur discharge paper from where will u take”.Seeing no use of further communication with a young lady on the Phone I talked to the DSO Imphal East shared my concerns and expressed the need for proper supports and advice. The Doctor understood the situation and as said I am open to follow all necessary advice including staying at Covid Care Centre based on proper assessments of the ground realities of home isolation and health situations of two of us. Following this discussion with the doctor all communication stopped from the Covid health care centers. Without further going into what followed thereafter and how we took care of ourselves till date some reflections on the experiences may help to understand the state health system’s response to health emergency situation and plight of infected persons.Firstly, what it is like to be infected by Covid-19 pandemic to ordinary citizen’s normal life, especially those who are non-salaried and labor to make their living? The live world of day-to-day life suddenly stops. You get cut off and isolated, you lose all your ascribed and acquired social status, power, wealth, roles and responsibilities in the family and community. You are suddenly disrobed of all the respects and dignity of life. You are left alone, confined, and isolated out of sight. You survive on sympathy of a few who really care for you and daredevil philanthropic services of few pious souls while being isolated. You cannot meet anyone, nor anyone would like to risk meeting you for the fear of infection and life risks. In a matter of a moment, you cease to be a right bearing living person in the society as you are suddenly reduced to a number in the spreadsheet of Covid-19 Databse. Worse is the situation when people in your neighbourhood who have some grudge against seems to justify your suffering is deserving because you are a bad person to them. It is said, ‘isolation’ is the greatest punishment for human-being but the greatest irony of Covid-19 pandemic is that you get the greatest punishment for no fault of yours! The only fault ordinary people may have committed may be ‘ignorance’ that again raises a question: What is the responsibility of the state education system and services if it is not to educate its people to dispel their ignorance? It is in such situation the public health system comes in to save your life upholding the human rights and dignity guaranteed under the Constitution.Secondly, how is the state health system responding to the situation. One can imagine the importance of professional and ethical services of all personnel employed under the health services in responding to such a tragic public health emergency which can wipe out the entire population. The system is mandated and provided with all resources and safety measures to save life in order to restore the sudden loss of human rights and dignity of all infected citizens in such a health emergency situation. Elsewhere, many have, from top to bottom, exhibited exemplary sense of duty at the cost of their lives and safety measures in saving lives of many during this pandemic. While the entire nation acknowledges such highly professional and ethical services of these health personnel in best performing state, the situation in a state like Manipur health system’s responses to the pandemic are highly apparently wanting through three consecutive waves of Covid-19 pandemic. This evident in my personal experiences.The response systems and mechanisms from the test center to the care center is baffling and apparently dehumanizing and blind. The response is apparently mechanical, one size fit all approach. Instead of making any sensible efforts to understand the situation of Covid patient the attempt is made to force upon certain formalities overlooking step by step processes of examining the specific situation of the patients, physical examination of home isolation and patient health condition. The entire procedures are being administered over phone including treatment without proper written prescriptions, instructions and guidelines. They almost seem to assume that all patients are equally knowledgeable as they are and would be able to understand everything that needs to followed at home stay condition. For them a patient may be punishable under the National Disaster Management Act if you are ignorant or if you try to raise question on their faulty response procedures. Instead of providing professional and ethical services for which they are being paid from public taxes they seem to be interested in finding faults with the patients. This is evident in the text messages above. There is another angle to be explored/The way in which health system responses in such emergency health situation also seems to aim at frustrating the needy people of their services enough to bow down to a level of either begging for their sympathy or bribe them to safe own lives or indirectly motivate people to rely on private health service providers. It is evident in the state. Health services have become a booming business since 1990s. But the tragedy for unemployed patients seeking private health services is that there are increasing number of people who get robbed off all their savings, property and assets once they enter into any of these private hospitals with serious illnesses. They save your life but leave nothing to live on when the treatment is over!Finally, this article is not to blame any personnel in the health services but an attempt to invite all to reflect together on the culture of corruption within which the political institutions functions from center to the state in Manipur. And unless the political class of our society take a serious relook at their own culture and practices for necessary reformation and correction, they will cause lots of suffering to the people far beyond their capacities to bear. Corruption in political affairs is dehumanizing. Political class look at the voters as number and their only efforts to measure the value of each voter in terms of money. Beyond the close relatives, some voters are purchased with kind words and personal touch and others are purchased at any higher cost to catch the winning margin. This attitude towards the citizens is the problem which has percolated down to staffs and personnel in all the social services institutions. This attitude can be changed if there is a will to do so for the advancement of the society.Economic development is in the interests and benefits of all: both the elected and the electors, but this development can happen only when education and health systems provide quality services. Unfortunately, it is these two sectors which are most abused in the state. If the political class looks at these two sectors as money making institutions for personal gains and employment opportunities for their party supporters and job buyers, then God alone save them. Lessons must be learnt from the nearest country like Bhutan where health and education services are absolutely free, and the most highly paid services in the country. This is done as a matter of policy for the country’s development: attract the most meritorious persons to work in these sectors and subject them to regular review of their performances.(Deben Bachaspatimayum is a social activist and teaches atNorth East Institute of Social Sciences and Research)Sent withProtonMailSecure Email."
goi-pledges-iaf-support-to-crush-illegal-poppy-fields-in-manipur,"COCOMI’s memorandum to the Defense Minister outlined several national security threats, including the leakage of sensitive information to foreign entities and alterations in official records that jeopardize national interests. These issues necessitate immediate attention and intervention from both the central and state governments. The assurance of IAF support to combat illegal poppy cultivation underscores the central government’s determination to address these pressing matters.By Kaoba AngomchaIn a significant and timely development, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) recently disclosed that Defense Minister Rajnath Singh had assured that the Government of India would be deploying the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes to destroy poppy fields in Manipur upon request by the state government. This commitment apparently emerged during a meeting with a delegation from the Delhi Meetei Coordinating Committee (DMCC), acting as representatives of COCOMI. The delegation raised concerns about the escalating national security threat posed by narco-terrorism in the region.COCOMI’s memorandum to the Defense Minister outlined several national security threats, including the leakage of sensitive information to foreign entities and alterations in official records that jeopardize national interests. These issues necessitate immediate attention and intervention from both the central and state governments. The assurance of IAF support to combat illegal poppy cultivation underscores the central government’s determination to address these pressing matters.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024The problem of unlawful poppy and cannabis cultivation, linked to ongoing narco-terrorism activities, is of profound concern to Manipur and the entire nation. In this context, the central government’s commitment to employ the Indian Air Force (IAF) to address this problem is a welcome and urgently needed measure.It is crucial to emphasize that the Manipur state government must now act proactively on this issue. While the central government has expressed its willingness to assist, the state government should take the lead in coordinating efforts to effectively combat illegal poppy and cannabis cultivation as part of its ‘War on Drugs’ initiatives. There is no room for delay on the part of the state government. Cooperation between the two levels of government is vital to achieving meaningful results promptly, particularly given the current ethnic crisis fueled by these illegal drug plantations.Furthermore, COCOMI’s call for urgent action extends beyond the central and state governments. COCOMI underscores the urgency of addressing this issue promptly. With its extensive network and influence, COCOMI has a pivotal role to play in mobilizing public support and exerting pressure on the state government to take swift action. The involvement of civil society organizations like COCOMI can serve as a catalyst for change and ensure that the central government’s commitments translate into tangible actions on the ground.Moreover, COCOMI’s concerns regarding the conduct of security forces, unequal treatment of various communities, and the imperative to address narco-terrorism and illegal immigration are all valid points requiring immediate attention. It is imperative that the central and state governments, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including COCOMI, work together comprehensively to address these issues.In conclusion, the central government’s commitment to deploy the IAF to eradicate illegal poppy cultivation in Manipur represents a critical step in safeguarding the region’s security and prosperity. It is imperative to eliminate the social vices that have persisted for far too long. This commitment should also extend to the eradication of illicit cannabis plantations and be met with swift, coordinated action by the Manipur state government, as well as proactive engagement by civil society organizations and stakeholders. The time for action is now, and the security and well-being of Manipur’s citizens depend on it."

music aficionados from across the country and also a fitness enthusiast including having keen interest in martial arts, weight lifting, boxing, and other sporting activities, Chuba was also one of the pioneers in introducing body building in Nagaland following his parent’s footsteps.This multi-lingual artist having crooned in ten languages including his mother tongue (Ao), English, Hindi, Bengali, Nepali, Assamese, Nagamese, Punjabi, Marathi and Tamil, was also one of the participants in a singing competition “Naga Nite” in the year 1984 which was hosted by department of art and culture,

in the year 1989 became the first ever Naga to have won a national level singing talent show aired on the national TV-“Lehar Lehar Sangeet”, where his anti-dowry Punjabi song won him hearts of many.Later on, it was eventually the language that took him places beyond Nagaland as according to his previous statement after 1989, there was no prospect of music in Nagaland but added that the linguistic adaptation had allowed him to mingle with various cultures in different cities around India by having stated that the “Language is the first bridge between people.”He also started a Non

cancer survivor and a fitness enthusiast, who had taken up the challenges to face life with a positive note and who himself had visited many schools and colleges in the state to testify his experience

Her husband alleged that she has been repeatedly tortured during interrogation by the junta forces.“It’s shocking that the military rulers have imprisoned a lady journalist-filmmaker with the allegation of abetting terrorism in the troubled country, which is undergoing a almost civil war since the junta orchestrated a coup on 1 February 2021 dethroning a democratically elected government under the leadership of Nobel laureate Aung Sah Suu Kyi. The junta (identified themselves as Military Council) must unconditionally release Shin Daewe along with other detained and imprisoned journalists,” said Blaise Lempen, president of PEC.Days back, the Independent Press Council Myanmar (IPCM) also denounced the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of journalists by the junta in the last three months. It confirmed that 52 journalists remain unjustly incarcerated by the military council till date. The IPCM asserted its commitment to expediting the release of detained journalists promptly and also safeguarding the rights of media outlets to express their news & views freely. The council also decided to collaborate with other organizations dedicated to the safety of media workers, exerting every possible effort to secure the freedom of journalists, and prevent the recurrence of such arrests.PEC’s south & southeast Asia representative Nava Thakuria informed that since the last military coup, the junta forces arrested over 170 journalists and only 118 have been released.

She pointed out that it is a “moral imperative” that the many children with disabilities still cannot acquire education simply because of the “educational system” is inaccessible to the PwDs.Saying that even in the case of adults with disabilities, the state commissioner for PwDs said they cannot venture out of their homes because of the “environment” created by not enabling them.Organized by Prodigals’ Home, and supported by EnAble India, regional director, Shijo Joseph, through a slide presentation explained how users could access “Hamari Vaani” through a simple mobile phone which requires no internet connection by simply dialling-9266344222 named “Hamari Vaani” in Hindi.He also shared how users could share and connect on different topics including employment, solutions to overcome disabilities, information about disability opportunities and others.Shijo also disclosed that though the facility is available only in Hindi at the moment, but EnAble is working towards introducing English, especially for those residents of the northeast.Also present in the programme was Nochet Longkumer, from the labour department, Dimapur, who highlighted on the different schemes and loans available for persons with disabilities in Nagaland including the upcoming loan mela collaborating with the National Handicapped Finance & Development Corporation (NHFDC) to provide concessional credit for the benefit of the persons with disabilities defined in PwD Act 2016 for starting any activities (business establishment or entrepreneurial livelihood etc.Moderated by Kewimadanlu, the programme started with an invocation prayer by youth director, MBCD, Rove Kape, while director, Prodigal’s Home, K Ela welcomed the gatherings."
the-silence-of-the-lambs-of-judiciary-and-impotence,"It can be questioned whether a police officer executes his duty in accordance with the law or rather is it subject to his whim and fancies or as per his superior officer’s illegal command is something to be discussed in detail by the concerned Court. Can the police officer who had signed the remand copy disown his authority by stating that his official duty was executed according to the order of his superior?By Paojel ChaobaThe primary purpose of Indian constitution is to safeguard the rights of the common man.   History has more than often witnessed since the time of the colonial era on the time during the British Raj on how and why and how often the criminal law is somehow seemingly misused in order to harass those who speaks out against the authority, against those who take the ethical stance they are left to be a minority and the system will twist the arm of the minority to make them to the line. This happens most of the time as those who are in their comfort cocoon finds it rather disturbing to come out of their safety cocoon and perhaps they would not rather take that step, though it would be the rightful and ethical choice. Man would rather be in the safe side rather than compromise their safety. That would be fact in most circumstances.However, the makers of Indian Constitution were wise enough to develop such mechanism and institutions to protect citizens of this country from the tyranny of misuse of criminal law by the authority especially the police. One such institution is our High Courts and Supreme Court of India where any aggrieved persons can reach out for safeguarding their rights. They are also simply known as constitutional court for the reasons that their institution is one that would uphold the constitutional, the fundamental rights of any citizen.In recent times, the questionable silence of our constitutional court left us truly amused and that silence is rather deafening. One would point out the glaring tell tale incident of the arrest of a 19 year old boy called Paominthang Haokip, a resident from Churachandpur District, Manipur arrested at midnight on the allegations of posting a message in a private Whatsapp group to kill the CM of Manipur secretly, He was arrested for that post invoking several sections of the Indian Penal Code and that too non-bailable ones. Still, he was released the next day without producing him before the concerned Magistrate. That is against the law as the police acted on their own and, not as per the rules and provisions of criminal law procedure.The question is whether the constitutional right guaranteed to this boy is lesser than those staying in the heart of the metro city?Would there be such a demeaning calm if this case came to the knowledge of any other High Court regarding the police’s overstepping the jurisdiction of the court?More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024The recent incident was seemingly an example of the police trying to please their political boss at the same time undermining the authority of the court which is to safeguard the freedom of a citizen, the police carried out the act in complete disregard of the law without thinking the consequences? Or perhaps, they were brazen enough in the untold assurance that their political masters would protect them, no matter what. Perhaps, that is what transpired recently!The Indian constitution is very clear on the separation of the powers between the Legislatures, Executive and Judiciary. The separation of powers is what checks the balance of power and its misuse. It is a blatant fact that the executives are often overwhelmed by the power of the legislators and they end up being just a political pawn in more ways than one. But there is enough constitutional safeguard given to the Constitutional Court and the Judiciary to stand up for the truth and for protecting the rights of the citizen and to take action against the misuse of criminal law which violates the fundamental rights of a citizen.In the recent incident there was violation of the Supreme Courts Guidelines laid down in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar. A common man just on reading Wikipedia  can grasp that an arrest is no longer the mandatory step after lodging a FIR against the person if the offence is punishable below seven years. Section 41 A Cr. P.C is mandatory in such cases where the person is charged with an offence which is punishable up to seven years. In short, any person who committed a crime which is punishable with a sentence upto 7 (seven) years cannot warrant an immediate arrest. There are many such cases where actions have been taken and the erring police officers which violated the guidelines of the Arnesh Kumar case.Ashok Kumar (LL 2021 SC 472) the accused person filed a case of contempt before the Delhi High Court for not giving him opportunity to serve section 41A notice which is in violation of the Supreme Court’s Arnesh Kumar guidelines. The Delhi High Court had sentenced the police officer for three months imprisonment. In another case of similar nature, the Telangana HC penalised four police personal including an IPS officer, however, the order was stayed by the divisional bench of the HC of Telangana.The purpose of reiterating this case is that the only institution which can take action against the police officers which takes the law in their own hands while undermining the authority of court is the Constitutional Court of a State.The question remain unanswered in the case of recent incident that why the High Court of Manipur is silent of this glaring incident of misuse of the criminal law , a case in which the OC of the Churachandpur police station submits his statement in a bizarre manner that whatever he did was the order of the superior? It can be questioned whether a police officer executes his duty in accordance with the law or rather is it subject to his whim and fancies or as per his superior officer’s illegal command is something to be discussed in detail by the concerned Court. Can the police officer who had signed the remand copy disown his authority by stating that his official duty was executed according to his superior officer order and not according to the law but in contravention of the CrPC remain unquestioned?Being silent is a powerful statement but if an authority like the High Court who is supposed to stand up for an individual’s constitutional rights remain silent in such cases of police atrocities, then it is a sign of being complicit to the act of the police and their political bosses.Such silence would further question the independence, accountability and transparency of the judicail institution, one which is safeguarded by the constitution. Less it be said that such silence is one…a silence of lambs or of judicial impotence."

India 2 (Bharat Lairenjam, 8’, Levis Zangminlun, 74’) Beat Bangladesh 0TFM Sports DeskEven as deceptive calm prevails in Manipur following the continuing spat of ethnic violence, two boys from the state- a Meitei and a Kuki –made India proud after they scored two goals to lift the South Asian Football Federation SAFF under-16 champion trophy held at Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu, Bhutan. Of the total 23 players of the Indian squad, 16 are from strife-torn Manipur, and among them, 11 are Meities, Kuki (4) and a Meitei Pangal (Manipuri Muslim).In the high-octane final, Bharat Lairenjam found the net in the first half, while Levis Zangminlun sealed the victory with a second-half goal, ensuring a comfortable win for India.

With adept ball distribution and intelligent utilisation of available space, they effectively countered Bangladesh’s more physical style of play. Key contributors like Mohammad Arbash, Vishal Yadav, and Levis Zangminlun penetrated the Bangladeshi defence with fluid runs and skillful dribbling, making it easier for India to dictate the tempo from start to finish.At the heart of India’s defence was the indomitable Karish Soram. Always alert, he fearlessly placed his body in the line of fire whenever the situation demanded. And when Bangladesh found a way past him, India goalkeeper Aheibam Suraj Singh stood like a rock, unyielding and resolute.India’s initial breakthrough came early, just eight minutes into the match. Levis Zangminlun provided an incisive through ball to forward Bharat Lairenjam, who swiftly invaded the space ahead and slotted the ball between the legs of Bangladesh goalkeeper Mohammad Nahidul Islam to score.Bangladesh responded to India’s goal and got a chance to equalise but Mohammed Mursed Ali fluffed his lines. The forward beat the offside trap and took control of a through ball from Bangladesh captain Nazmul Huda Faysal. However, India goalkeeper Suraj Singh swiftly charged forward to cut down the angle, causing Ali to miss the target.Throughout the first half, Lairenjam and India’s captain, Mate Ngamgouhou, consistently pressured the Bangladeshi defence, creating multiple scoring opportunities. In the 34th minute, a particularly promising chance materialised. A long ball was lofted towards the Bangladesh penalty area, prompting Indian forward Mohammad Arbash to give chase. Recognising that Bangladeshi goalkeeper Nahidul Islam had ventured off his line to attempt a clearance, Arbash seized the moment. He skillfully attempted to head the ball over the onrushing keeper. However, Islam was quick to react, successfully punching the ball out of harm’s way and preserving the 1-0 scoreline as the teams entered halftime.India started the second half with the same intensity. Their relentless search for another goal bore fruit in the 74th minute with a sublime strike. Samson Ahongshangbam initiated a promising move down the left wing before expertly switching play to send the ball to Levis Zangminlun on the opposite flank. Engaging in a swift one-two pass with Vishal Yadav, Zangminlun outmanoeuvred his defender to find himself in open space. Taking a moment to set himself, he then unleashed a devastating left-footed strike that sailed into the back of the net, doubling India’s advantage.INDIA XI: Aheibam Suraj Singh, Mate Ngamgouhou, Karish Soram, Mohammed Kaif, Levis Zangminlun, Md Arbash (Manbhakupar Malngiang, 83’), Bharat Lairenjam (Aiborlang Kharthangmaw, 90’), Vishal Yadav (Bobby Singh, 83’), Samson Ahongshangbam (Rishi Singh Ningthoukhongjam, 90’), Yaipharemba Chingakham, Thoungamba Singh Usham."

a-good-hearted-thai-ladys-journey-to-manipur,"Maynumpetch wishes the best for Manipur. She exhibits a rare sense of admiration for the Land of Jewels that would be the envy of many who are truly captivated by the variegated culture of the state.By Marjing MayanglambamI am truly honored to have known Maynumpetch. Just as Louise Lightfoot admired the beauty of Manipur’s art and culture, she was genuinely charmed by Manipuri dance as she pursued her bachelor’s degree in Thailand. Maynumpetch’s inspiration made her discover more about Manipur. She eventually discovered the uncanny resemblance and similarities of certain cultural traits between the people of Manipur and Thailand. As she became familiar with the connections, she wanted to visit Manipur. Owing to her utmost dedication, devotion, and love for the land of jewels, she finally reached Manipur in 2015.Maynumpetch graduated from Visva Bharati Santiniketan University in Drama and Theatre Arts. Who is Maynumpetch? Well, I am not the only person eager to know her, but as far as I know, she hails from Bangkok. She has a younger sister and many cousins who all grew up together in the beautiful land of Thailand. I may add that she is a very engaging and hard-working lady, and has lots of fans and acquaintances not only from Manipur but also from the Northeastern region of India.I also questioned myself about the mythological belief about the aromatic black rice, which we Manipuris believed came from Thailand. (Poireiton Chak-Hao) It could be a mere coincidence, historical occurrence, or folklore, but Manipur and Thailand have many cultural links, starting with art, culture, and food habits.Maynumpetch also got her motivation to travel from another compatriot. She developed the idea to make Vlogs even though she had no much knowledge about YouTube back then. She felt a lot like home whenever she came to Manipur because of the people, the food, and the environment. And thinks that Manipur is like her second home. There is this deep feeling inside her that deeply connects her with Manipur. She is always longing to visit this small mountainous land dotted with a unique single valley.More Stories like this3rd North East Games 2024 kickstarts with musical…Mar 19, 2024Police Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Her honest response when I asked about the people of the state, was that there are so many people from Manipur, which is uncountable, who had indeed helped her in many ways. Beyond Manipur, she has also visited various states of Northeast India, and her passion has burnt like a wildfire in India as a whole.Maynumpetch is a lovely person. And nobody would ever say or feel negative about her. My humble textual portrayal of Maynumpetch may sound like an elementary exaggeration, but these words are too little for such a priceless soul.I have not met her in real life, but I can say with pride that she is indeed a shining gem who cares for Manipur so genuinely as if she were born and raised amidst the misty hills and dales of this land.She always prays for peace and prosperity of Manipur and India. She cannot be who she is right now without the support of us in India. She has been expressing her gratitude to us and praying for peace, stability, and development to prevail in Manipur. Her videos on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are so wonderfully crafted that I even approached her for this short article one and a half years ago but could not publish it due to many reasons. However, this year, I believe that Maynumpetch’s peace and loving message will surely bring a change to Manipur and all of India.“Praying for everyone to stay happy and spread love.” – Maynumpetch(Marjing Mayanglambam is aPena Balladeer from Manipur, India)"

manipur-govt-duly-informed-about-arrest-of-unlf-p-leaders-while-cm-feigns-ignorance,"Sidabamapu, “chief of army” of Pambei-led United National Liberation Front (UNLF), Ingba, “chief of intelligence” and “corporal” Landaba have now been remanded to 10-day custody even as Manipur government feigned ignorance about the details of their arrest on March 13.TFM Special ReportManipur chief minister N Biren Singh had reportedly stated that the arrest of Sidabamapu, “chief of army” of UNLF (P), Ingba, “chief of intelligence ”and “corporal” Landaba “was made without the state government’s knowledge”.Read Details:https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/n-biren-singh-demands-release-of-3-members-of-manipur-armed-outfit-2514998-2024-03-15The chief minister also appealed to the Union Government for the unconditional release of the three Pambei-led United National Liberation Front (UNLF) leaders “if they are not guilty of any wrongdoing”. Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has remanded the three persons to 10-day custody from March 13 to March 23, 2024.On the arrest of the UNLF (P) leaders, N Biren Singh had reportedly stated that the state government was not officially intimated about the arrest. However, it has come to light that the NIA on March 13, the day the three were arrested, had officially informed the Superintendent of Police (SP), Imphal West about the arrest in NIA Case No. RC 23/2023/NIA Delhi-reg. The intimation letter to the SP Imphal West also asked him to inform the family members of the three accused.The NIA letter to SP confirmed the arrest of Thokchom Shyamjai Singh @ Thokchom Gyaneshor @ Thoiba @ Zatawn, @ Zaw Tun @ Shidabamapu, aged 45, son of (late) Th lbotombi, resident of Mayang Imphal, Imphal West; Laimayum Anand Sharma @ Ingba, aged 50, son of (late) L Indreshwar Sharma, resident of Yaiskul Hiruhanba Leikai, Imphal West; and Salam Ibomcha Meitei @ Landaba, aged 38, son of Lokeswar Meitei, resident of Salam Keikhu Langjing, Imphal West. The NIA court granted the remand plea on March 13.As per reports, Thoiba alias Sidabamapu is the “chief of army” of UNLF (P) while Ingba was the “chief intelligence” and another cade named Landaba was a “corporal” of the outfit.The three Pambei-led UNLF cadres were taken into custody in connection with case number RC 23/2023/NIA/DLI by NIA, New Delhi. The case is related to a “transnational conspiracy by Myanmar based leadership of militant outfits to wage war against the government of India by exploiting the current ethnic unrest in Manipur.” The three were charged under section 120 B, 121 A, 122 of the IPC and sec 18 (B),39 of the UAPA 1967.It may be recalled that Moirangthem Anand along with four others were arrested by a team of NIA in connection with the same case number 23 of 2023 of NIA, New Delhi on September 21, 2023. It is under the same case that the three UNLF (P) members were arrested.Moirangthem Anand was airlifted to New Delhi and he is now lodged in Tihar Jail. Whereas, the four others were released on bail. The NIA has registered the case as suo-moto on July 19, 2023 with case number 23 of 2023 NIA, New Delhi. It now remains to be seen how UNLF (P) leaders are actually related to the case mentioned. UNLF (P) is currently under a “peace agreement” with the Government of India.More Stories like thisIntegrated Management Plan for Loktak Lake approved: Loktak…Mar 20, 2024Arrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024Read Details:https://thefrontiermanipur.com/unlf-under-leadership-of-chairman-kh-pambei-decides-to-sign-ceasefire-pact-with-goi-for-onward-political-negotiation/What exactly is NIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI?NIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI is also known as the “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case”. The chargesheet filed under section 173 Cr. PC in the Court of Special Judge, NIA Patiala House, New Delhi in the Union of India Versus Hangshi Tangkhul and others, states that:“The central government had received credible inputs in respect of a transnational conspiracy hatched by Myanmar based leadership of terror outfits operationally active in the North Eastern Indian states to exploit the current ethnic unrest in the state of Manipur to wage a war against the Government of India and execute terrorist attacks thereby exacerbating the current security situation in Manipur.”The chargesheet dispatched on 07-03-2023 says that “China-Myanmar module of NSCN (I-M) based in Myanmar under the leadership of Hangshi Tangkhul and Absolom Tangkhul” have decided to extend support to proscribed organisations, Kanglei Yawol Kanba Lup (KYKL) and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to “infiltrate their cadres into the Indian territory” for carrying out attacks inside the country. For this purpose, the NSCN (I-M) leaders promised “a safe passage along with arms, ammunition, explosives and other terrorist hardware” to Manipur based outfits and proscribed organisations.“In addition, these outfits have also been tasked to identify, recruit and train impressionable youths and get then involved in the ongoing violence with the larger goal of destabilizing the security situation in Manipur and to further wage a war against the Government of India”, said the same chargesheet.Hence, a case was registered on 19-07-2023 by the NIA in compliance of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Codes and The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UA(P) Act 1967).Subsequently on 16-09-2023, Moirangthem Anand along with four others were arrested by a team of NIA in connection with the same case number 23 of 2023 of NIA, New Delhi on September 21, 2023.Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case and armed groups in NortheastNIA Case No. RC-23/2023/NIA/DLI or “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case” in the chargesheet submitted earlier clearly makes an attempt to establish how groups like National Socialist Council of Nagalim – NSCN (I-M), KYKL and PLA extended support to each other. However, how the leaders of the Pambei-led UNLF are related to the “conspiracy” is one big question being asked by political watchers and observers in Manipur.“The centre, particularly the Ministry of Home Affairs seems to be working on a grand plan to implicate as many armed political groups operating in Manipur and across the Indo-Myanmar border irrespective of whether they are in different stages of political engagements with New Delhi. Hence, we see even the NSCN (I-M) has also been linked with KYKL or PLA and now even UNLF (P) in the  NIA’s “Transnational Conspiracy by Myanmar Based Outfits Case”. All these apparently pertain to those armed groups who supposedly waging a war against India”, opines a political observer who does not want to be identified.There had been valley-wide protests launched by several civil society organisations on the arrest of the three leaders. One common refrain that can be heard from the public is “How can leaders or cadres of an outfit under peace agreement with the Government of India be arrested by NIA randomly?” or “What impact would such arrests being made with the official green signal from the Ministry of Home Affairs have on the way how the peace-agreement unfolds?”. As protests over the arrest of UNLF (P) leaders continue, the would definitely be some form of strategized operations to keep the proscribed armed groups in Manipur and the Northeast India under the control of New Delhi while observers are kept on tenterhooks."
prime-minister-narendra-modis-imphal-visit-an-appearance-of-solidity-to-pure-wind,"The Prime Minister’s effort to link peace with development in the region will have few buyers. While the assumption can be mechanically forged, recent events in the region prove otherwise – peace is still a distant dream while development is consigned to the lubricated arena of the few, for the few and by the few.By Dhiren A Sadokpam‘Political language – and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists – is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.’The above lines by George Orwell, the English journalist and critic known for his lucid prose and biting social criticism, seem to have woken up to a new contemporary reality close to us – Manipur. Though the state has been at times dubbed as a “failed state” due to numerous state of affairs that run contrary to accepted norms of democratic governance, what has truly attracted the wits of keen observers is the sheer mismatch between political gimmicks and ground reality. Here, one is not referring to the realities of war and peace but of claims and counter claims.Like all previous regimes, there has been a habitual tendency to claim major achievements on Manipur’s diverse sectors such as Road Infrastructure, Drinking Water Supply, Health, Urban Development, Housing, Information Technology, Skill Development, Art and Culture, among others.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made tall claims, he might have been accurate with the figures of funds bestowed upon Manipur by the benevolent union government. On Tuesday, while inaugurating 13 projects worth around Rs 1850 crore and laying the foundation stones of nine projects worth around Rs 2950 crore in Imphal, Modi said, “We also have to maintain stability in Manipur and also take Manipur to new heights of development. And only the double engine government can do this work”.More Stories like thisArrest of MPA’s Chief of Army In-Charge goes against…Mar 18, 2024Manipur govt duly informed about arrest of UNLF (P) leaders…Mar 16, 2024Enough is enough, Govts must devise way to resolve conflict…Mar 14, 2024The figures for funds sanctioned and allocated could be correct for each of the sectors mentioned but who dares speak about their success or the achievement? Or have some of these projects been truly implemented for the benefits of the people. The answer is not far to seek. For instance, the Prime Minister referred to ‘Water Transmission system of Thoubal Multi-purpose project’ worth 280 crore which was inaugurated by him. The stated target of the same project is to provide drinking water supply to the Imphal city as if the city did not have an already failed water supply system. So what did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government do for the last almost five years? Just watch Imphal and greater Imphal areas experience not only an erratic supply system but a failed system. Asked any residents of Imphal city and he or she will tell you how they people buy water from the mushrooming private parties that sell them for an inflated price. Here, it is worth mentioning that Jal Jeevan Mission has already claimed that out of 4.5 lakh rural households in the State, 2.75 lakh (61%) are getting tap water supply in their homes and the state plans to become “Har Ghar Jal” in 2022. Yes, the homes of the 2.75 lakh residents might have been connected with water pipes but no is not sure if all these pipes bring home the Adam’s ale. And a few knows what is the actual status of the ‘Augmentation of Senapati District Headquarter Water Supply Scheme’ built at a cost of Rs. 51 crore.The inaugurated three projects under ‘Imphal Smart City Mission’, developed at a cost of more than Rs 170 crore, including the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC)’, ‘Development of Western River front on Imphal River (Phase I)’ and ‘Development of Mall Road at Thangal Bazar (Phase I)’ can be critiqued from different development paradigms. However, these projects and earlier urban development projects always seemed to have skidded off the road with mere cosmetic changes. If there were garbage piled up along the Mall Road at Thangal Bazar few weeks ago, they might have been lifted a couple of days back for momentary enticement of the public. Similar state of affairs awaits other sectors like Health, Housing, Information Technology, Skill Development, Art and Culture etc.One has been skeptical of all these projects mentioned not because of wild speculations on their possibilities in the near future but because of enormous funds sanctioned earlier and the deceitful claims of achieving each target.The Prime Minister said that his government had resolved to ‘Act East’ for the Northeast region. He said, “God has given so many natural resources, so much potential to this region. There are so many possibilities for development and tourism here”. He added that work is now being done to realize these possibilities in the region. “Northeast is now becoming the gateway to India’s development”, he said. On the abundant natural resources and potentials of the Northeast, Modi was right on target. However, the efforts on making the region the gateway of India’s development can be styled as mere political rhetoric that can be at best used by a seasoned political propagandist. The quantum and volume of trade transacted in the region will show a different scenario that barely benefits the Northeast. The government of India’s “Act East Policy” too over the years has become a mere topic of academic discourse rather than a reality that truly impacts the Northeast region of India. One is not denying the efforts made so far but the snail-paced implementation of proposed plans and policies with or without funds from international financial institutes.Modi said “due to the continuous efforts of the double engine government, there is no fire of extremism and insecurity in this region, but there is light of peace and development. Hundreds of youths across the North East have left arms and joined the mainstream of development”. The Prime Minister said the agreements which were pending for decades, the current government has taken these historical accords to conclusion. From a ‘blockade state’, Manipur has become a state giving way for international trade, he said. The Prime Minister’s effort to link peace with development in the region will have few buyers. While the assumption can be mechanically forged, recent events in the region prove otherwise – peace is still a distant dream while development is consigned to the lubricated arena of the few, for the few and by the few. One has also observed that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi while seeking the mandate of the people of Manipur in the coming elections, remained silent on the recent outcry on the removal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from Manipur and the Northeast region. If Modi claims that “there is light of peace and development” why does the Prime Minister shy away from commenting on the rationale of imposing AFSPA in the region? Therein lies the logic of political dominance and subservience. These are some of the instant thoughts one can fathom on the speech delivered by Modi. While most parts of his speech can be critically dissected, one is cornered to belief that political propaganda as such is designed “to make lies sound truthful” and give an “appearance of solidity to pure wind”.(Dhiren A.

At the end of all politics, it all boils down to the VOTE. There is nothing more important or powerful than the vote. Only the vote is recognized. All wisdom and narratives have no meaning without a vote,” Therie said.By Imna Longchar, TFM Nagaland CorrespondentFormer Nagaland finance minister, and Nagaland Pradesh Congress Committee (NPCC) chief, K Therie, on Sunday said that as per the party’s promise (Congress) that in order to give an opportunity on the Women’s Reservation Bill, it has become a reality now which the party would amend the Bill to implement it although the Bill is linked to “census and delimitation”.Therie, who recently resigned as the chief of the NPCC paving way for Supongmeren Jamir to take over the mantle of the NPCC president, mentioned that in 2018, the state assembly would witness a change of atleast 20 elected women members in the state assembly, four to five elected members in the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). He believed that with the elected women’s participation in the assembly would improve “decency” in governance. It may be mentioned that on the occasion of the “Women’s Rights Day” in Chennai, the former AICC president, Sonia Gandhi, reasserted the implementation of the “Women’s Reservation Bill” with a goal, the country’s goal for which the women must fight together in order to be ‘victorious”, Therie reminded.He said that it was also in that year where a voice was called to women folks for them to decide and join political parties and learn the Constitutions and functions of political party (s) where the former said that there are two diverse ideological parties, and other regional parties survived by supporting either one of their ideologies.More Stories like thisPolice Memorial unveiled at NAPTC Complex in ChoumoukedimaMar 17, 2024PPFA appreciates Assamese society on CAA understandingMar 16, 2024‘Hamari Vaani’ for persons with disabilities foray into…Mar 8, 2024The former Nagaland finance minister also said that BJP’s idea is “Hindutva” which meant Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Kingdom), and Hindi language and Hinduism, and for them, Uniform Civil Code (UCC) means “One Nation, One Language and One Religion” while not expressing or talking about “uniforms” or “untouchability” including prohibition of women from entering temples.Highlighting that the ideology of Congress is a secular, socialist democratic republic which it believes in “unity in diversity”, Therie also shared that the Congress believed in freedom of religion and freedom of expression and aimed to provide justice and equality to all sections of people as the Congress is against untouchability and that all citizens are equal.“Women have more or less 50% votes. They can change the political equations. At the end of all politics, it all boils down to the VOTE. There is nothing more important or powerful than the vote. Only the vote is recognized.

It came to public notice only after the Arakan Army, a Rakhine based ethnic armed group, captured Mrauk-U township from the junta forces and discovered their bodies, reported local media.More Stories like thisPEC expresses concern over arrest of Burmese journalistsDec 15, 2023Record number of journalists killed in Gaza within 2 monthsDec 9, 2023Meitei Diaspora in Europe with IPSA VP Stages…Sep 30, 2023According to a statement issued by the Arakan Army, most of the deceased were under forties and the exact dates of their killing are yet to be confirmed. A former reporter for Democratic Voice of Burma, Myat Thu Tun also contributed under the name of Phoe Thiha to other media outlets like 7Day News Journal, The Voice, Development Media Group, etc. Another victim Ko Kyaw Zan Wai was an active social media user, who often posted humorous content about the junta.“It’s shocking that the Rakhine journalist was murdered by the junta soldiers when he was under their custody. The frustrated military junta, which is facing offensives from a number of armed groups with failures in many battles, must respect the civilian’s rights. For any reason, the Min Aung Hlaing led military regime in Naypietaw, should be allowed to kill a media person. We demand a fair probe into the incident to bring the military dictators under the international criminal laws,” said PEC president Blaise Lempen.PEC’s southeast Asia representative informed that Myat Thu Tun along with other six civilians were seemingly killed on 31 January by two soldiers belonging to 378th Light Infantry Battalion as they faced the AA offensive in Mrauk-U locality in western Myanmar. The bodies were also buried in a bomb shelter near the township hospital. Shockingly, the junta has not issued any statement on the incident and hence the family was unaware about the death of Myat Thu Tun, who was arrested from his residence a few months back."
